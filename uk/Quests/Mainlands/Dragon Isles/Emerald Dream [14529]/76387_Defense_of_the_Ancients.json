    "Description": "Fyrakk's forces at Skystone Falls are already threatening to overwhelm us. I fear not even the combined might of the Sentinels and Ancients can hold out against them.\r\n\r\nThe Ancients are bearing the brunt of the offensive. We have reports of djaradin attempting to capture them for some unknown purpose.\r\n\r\nWe cannot allow Igira to succeed in whatever nefarious plan she has in mind. You must seek out the Ancients on the battlefield and free any who are captured.",
