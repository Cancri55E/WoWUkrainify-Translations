    "Description": "Galenori's report is deeply troubling.\r\n\r\nThe Eye's temple is my seat of power here in the Dream. From it, I commune with the Eye's energies and monitor the health of the Dream and its denizens. The Eye's power flows throughout the Dream, and helps Amirdrassil grow.\r\n\r\nIf the djaradin take control of it, they could pervert its nature and stunt the growth of the tree.\r\n\r\nMy daughter knows the Eye's importance. I will follow her lead--and so should you.",
