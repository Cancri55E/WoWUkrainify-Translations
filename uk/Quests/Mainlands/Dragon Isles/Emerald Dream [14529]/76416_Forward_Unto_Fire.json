    "Description": "Amirdrassil draws power from the Wellspring Temple in preparation for its bloom. The barrier protecting the temple will not last much longer under Fyrakk's assault.\r\n\r\nI have sent messengers all across Azeroth asking for reinforcements, but none have yet arrived. Something blocks their path into the Dream. For now, we must rely on the forces we have.\r\n\r\nI ask you to travel to the Verdant Pass. If there is anyone I would have by my side, it is you.",
