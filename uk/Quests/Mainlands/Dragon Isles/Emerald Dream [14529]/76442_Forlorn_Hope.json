    "Description": "You've arrived just in time. Norana lurks just beyond the ridge. She appears to be taking part in some manner of ritual - alongside a man who appears to be their leader.\r\n\r\nThese are powerful druids, and their strength is amplified by their ties to the Firelands. Taking the blade to all of them at once would be foolish.\r\n\r\nStill, the least we can do is disrupt their ritual. If we send them scattering, we buy ourselves time - and an opportunity to press the advance elsewhere.",
