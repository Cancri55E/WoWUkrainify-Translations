    "Description": "In the Dream, memories can live on in unusual ways. Memories are not always linear. And memories that are not of your own can become yours.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you were drawn to this place by the presence of the once-Dreamer. Or perhaps you were drawn to this place because of my great friend. Come, won't you see?\r\n\r\nRest here and let the magic of the Dream wash over you.",
