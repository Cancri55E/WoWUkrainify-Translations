    "Description": "Amirdrassil is growing and needs nourishment. Dear old Sprucecrown has a ritual to bloom life around the tree, but our enemies have taken note. We need all the help we can get.\r\n\r\nDuring the ritual, Sprucecrown will draw on the magic of the Dream to grow Dreamfruit. Consuming these will grant you amazing powers. Only a few of these powerful and delicious fruits can appear. Keep an eye out for them!\r\n\r\nPray lend a hand, hero, and the dream will reward you aplenty.",
