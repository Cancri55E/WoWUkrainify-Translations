    "Description": "Now that you've learned the fundamentals, you can easily upgrade lower-level gear.\r\n\r\nSooner than later, though, you will find better gear that requires various types of Dreaming Crests to upgrade. Much like Flightstones, these Crests are rewarded through many different activities. Dreaming Crests have four tiers, and more dangerous tasks reward you with higher-tier crests.\r\n\r\nGo and help with tasks, down formidable foes, find treasures, and bring me a few handfuls of Whelpling's Dreaming Crests!",
