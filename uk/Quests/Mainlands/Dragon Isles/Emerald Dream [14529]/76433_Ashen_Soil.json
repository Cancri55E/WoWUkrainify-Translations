    "Description": "It seems the Druids of the Flame wasted no time in seeking to expand their influence. \r\n\r\nDeep within these barrow dens, some manner of corruption has taken root. It will spread if left unchecked, consuming the entire den before expanding outwards to threaten the rest of the dream.\r\n\r\nTime is short, $n. Delve into the barrow, seek out the sources of the spreading flame, and excise them before the smoldering embers can grow and spread.",
