    "Description": "You say that Tempo mentioned objects from other timelines?\n\nI have a device used for syncing melodies. Strangely enough, it seems to have the same effect on timelines in this town. Perhaps a side effect of the chaotic temporal energies here?\n\nI've upgraded Pedgi's glasses to allow him to observe the rhythms of the world. They may make it easier to find mis-timed entities. Ask if you can borrow them.",
