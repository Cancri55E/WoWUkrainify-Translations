    "Description": "When the magic of Bronze and Infinite collided, it sent Chronormu and Eternus into an uncontrolled tumble through time.\n\nAs they fall, they rip the fabric of time itself, sending out countless ripples across time and space. We must locate them and bring them back. Only then will we be able to stop any further damage. I see that you will be the one to stop Chronormu's fall.\n\nI would ask that you to gather the allies you will need to save Chronormu, while I focus on her magic.",
