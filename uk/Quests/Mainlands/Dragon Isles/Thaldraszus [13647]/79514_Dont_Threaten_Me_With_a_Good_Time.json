And when she does, she'll pick a visage form!\n\nChromie told us all about the celebrations dragons used to have for Visage Day.\n\nSo, Kalecgos and I are going to blow stuff up! Fireworks, mostly.\n\nWe'll need some arcane residue to make them, though.\n\nConveniently, there are some arcane elementals just outside the Gardens of Unity that are ripe for the harvest.\n\nThe three of us have some other preparations to make here in Valdrakken.",
