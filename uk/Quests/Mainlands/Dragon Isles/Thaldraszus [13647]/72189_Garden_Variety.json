    "Description": "Are you enjoying the butterfly garden?\n\nYou know, there's a much larger garden just to the south of here. An older drakonid by the name of Gryrmpech tends to it.\n\nHe could always use an extra pair of hands. He has an 'assistant', but I've never actually seen him. I can't imagine he's of much help.\n\nIf you stop by, be sure to let him know that Xina sent you.",
