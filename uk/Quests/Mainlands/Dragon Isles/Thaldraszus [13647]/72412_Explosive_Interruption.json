    "Description": "I managed to infiltrate a rebel camp, down in Scalewatch Cavern. It seemed like any other camp, except for frequent wagons coming into camp with their contents covered.\n\nEventually, I was able to discreetly make my way to where the wagons would be unloaded. The rebels are stockpiling bombs, but it's even worse!\n\nThey're piling the bombs against a pillar directly underneath the aqueduct from Tyrhold.\n\nMeet me down there, and we'll find a way to stop this!",
