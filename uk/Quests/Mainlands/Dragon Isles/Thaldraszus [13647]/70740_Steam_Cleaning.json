    "Description": "Xijan seems to think the elemental invasion on our beautiful spa is only a minor problem, but this surge of flame and steam needs to be brought under control immediately.\n\nWe had booked musical acts to play in the lower area, but the elementals destroyed their gear. As we have never had such levels of elemental destruction in this area before, I suspect Primalist influences.\n\nIf you want to help, clear the elementals on the east side of the lower spa. That is where the first events are scheduled.",
