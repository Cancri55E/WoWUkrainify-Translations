We're fighting to preserve what's left and take the world back, but your arrival has caused some trouble. \n\nWe use the essence of those elementals out there to fuel our protections and keep ourselves safe. See that shield? That's the only thing keeping us from discovery and annihilation and you drained our resources. Bring back some of that essence and we may survive another day.",
