    "Description": "Even with their leader gone, the Tarasek are unlikely to stop using their poison-tipped spears simply because we ask them nicely. I cannot risk even one of these weapons being used on an unsuspecting traveler.\n\nThey will all need to be destroyed. If you did not see any in the caches by the pools, then the Embertooth are likely keeping their spears closer to the source. \n\nNo one else will get hurt because of my carelessness. Enter the cave and destroy any weapon caches that you find.",
