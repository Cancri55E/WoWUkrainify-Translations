    "Description": "I may not be great at my job, but at least I paid attention when I was learning how to do it. Every Waywatcher worth her scales knows how to make a proper antidote. I just need enough poison to mix it properly.\n\nNori said the tarasek who attacked her had spears coated with the stuff. Find them and bring their spears to me. If my hunch is correct, I'll be able to make an antidote with the residue from the spearheads.\n\nI just hope we have enough time.",
