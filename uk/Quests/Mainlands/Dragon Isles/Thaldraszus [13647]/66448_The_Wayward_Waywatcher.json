    "Description": "The Waywatchers have kept the roads of Thaldraszus safe for travelers for as long as I can remember. It is a duty that my family has upheld with honor for generations.\n\nAlas, my sister Alvi seems less than interested in that honor of late. She is supposed to report to me here each morning, but I have not heard from her in over a day. \n\nIf you find a bronze drakonid east of here, lazing about with her head in the clouds, I ask that you direct her to me. Otherwise, I will have to seek her out myself.",
