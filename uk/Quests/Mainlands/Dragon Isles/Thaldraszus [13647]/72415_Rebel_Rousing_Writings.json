    "Description": "The rebels seem to have a lot of signs and flyers around the cave. They probably use it as a way to keep everyone aligned to their purpose, and motivated to fight.\n\nIt's hard to keep a large group united around a cause - especially if you use detestable methods like bombing civilians or destroying a water source - without a steady stream of reinforcement.\n\nLet's get a bunch of their propaganda. It may tell us a lot about what they're thinking, or who's telling them what to think.",
