    "Description": "When the temple locked down, the Wardens got sealed up with the temple doors. We need to pop that stasis bubble to get them out! Unfortunately, that'll need a fully empowered Timewalker staff...\n\nI know! You can drain the crystals here on the platforms! That should power up your staff enough.\n\nThey have their own stasis fields, so just yank them out and absorb their energy with your staff.\n\nAnd don't feel bad if they shatter--the power is still there, even if it's in pieces!",
