Once Emberthal has returned, we shall throw a proper Visage Day celebration.\n\nThe fireworks are to match the colors of the dragonflights.\n\nEach enclave of the city grows special flowers in accordance with that enclave's flight.\n\nThree of each color should be enough for the first batch of fireworks.",
