    "Description": "Tyr is back after thousands of years. I don't even know how many thousands. His world has changed more than we can even imagine. He's going to have many questions and need answers. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, there's nothing any of the Tyr's Guard would rather do than talk with Tyr. Tyr's Rest seems like the perfect place to give him time, answer questions, and process those answers. Would you ask him to join us there?",
