Those nasty fiends have disrupted everything. Probably even the new you-ga instructor. \n\nOh yes, you-ga is a new type of stretching that helps you meditate at the same time. I am sure both teacher and students are so relaxed they do not even notice the elementals.\n\nStill, better to be safe than sorry. Please, look for them.",
