Unfortunately, their leader, Agitator Zoralek, made the choice for us when he threatened the aqueduct.\n\nFight your way inside the cave, and put a stop to Agitator Zoralek by any means necessary, before he can set off those bombs. Then bring back his detonator so we can secure it. Once we have that, the Scalesworn will be able to remove the bombs safely.",
