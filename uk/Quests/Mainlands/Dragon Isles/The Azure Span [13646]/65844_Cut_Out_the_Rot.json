    "Description": "This decay must have rotted these gnolls' brains as well as their bodies! \n\nDestructive as they are, gnolls are native to this land--just like us.\n\nBut we already saw them spreading decay to the Big Tree Tribe. At this rate, they'll consume the Span and destroy themselves. \n\nWe can't let this happen. It's a shame... but put an end to them.",
