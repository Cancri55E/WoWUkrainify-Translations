Am I the reason he has lost his spark?\n\nHe says he loves me, but... you heard how not painting makes him feel.\n\nI want what is best for him. If he is better off... I will go. \n\nThere is one last piece he threw away. The last thing he tried to draw before giving up. \n\nI could not bear to see it go. I hid it away in our home. Please... bring it to him... as a memento.",
