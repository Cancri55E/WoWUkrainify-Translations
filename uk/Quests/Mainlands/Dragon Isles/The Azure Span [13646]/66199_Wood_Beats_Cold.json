    "Description": "So, what is with this crazy white stuff? It could get cold in Vol'dun but we never had to worry about frozen fire wood. \r\n\r\nWe are going to freeze if we cannot find some dry firewood. And what would you know we walked right through a forest on the way here with dry wood all over the ground... why not setup a camp there? \r\n\r\nWell no one listens to me, they just want me to get it figured out. \r\n\r\nSo I need you to gather 20 Pieces of Firewood from the west of the Azure Span.",
