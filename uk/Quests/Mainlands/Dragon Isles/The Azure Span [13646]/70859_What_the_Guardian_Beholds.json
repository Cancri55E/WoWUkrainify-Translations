I was the Kirin Tor mage who first discovered this artifact, Valthrux, and the Sundered Flame's plans.\n\nThe retrieval and study of this supposedly sentient and powerful artifact is of the utmost importance, and mark my word, I shall be the one to do it.\n\nThe Sundered Flame guess at its location, but I've used my magic to find a path for us.\n\nThere is a corrupted guardian nearby that holds a magic shard connected to Valthrux. I can use it to find the rest of the artifact.",
