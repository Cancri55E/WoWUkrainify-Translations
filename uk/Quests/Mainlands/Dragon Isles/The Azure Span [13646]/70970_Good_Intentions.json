Alia was whispering frantically when you brought all the shards back.\n\nShe kept saying something about a \"cave\" and how the spiders seemed attracted to it.\n\nThere's no cave in the area in front of us... which leads me to believe there might be one deeper in the ruins.\n\nWe'll stay here and keep your escape path open, $n. Please save Alia and destroy this cursed artifact.",
