Time enough for me to watch the gnolls around here.\n\nGnolls are usually a nuisance, but the decay gnolls around Brackenhide Hollow...\n\nThe decay doesn't just warp their bodies. It warps their minds too.\n\nDecaymonger Rotpaw is the worst of them. She's indiscriminate in who or what she spreads her decay to: the unwilling of her people, travelers, animals, children...\n\nIf there's any justice in this world, she should be taken down.",
