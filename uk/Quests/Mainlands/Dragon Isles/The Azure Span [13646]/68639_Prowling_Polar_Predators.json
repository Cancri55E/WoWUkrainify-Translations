    "Description": "The species we've been sent to study is the frigidpelts.\n\nTheir hunting grounds have been tainted by ley lines. Arcane energies leech into the water and into the plants... and into prey species like the slyvern.\n\nBut unlike other organisms, the frigidpelts survive the process and gain power from it.\n\nThey also become aggressive--which is a problem. Engage a few, and I will take notes on their strength and aggression. \n\nMy report will help the Kirin Tor decide what to do for them.",
