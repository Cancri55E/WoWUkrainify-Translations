They're after an artifact called \"Valthrux\".\n\nIt's immensely powerful and... sentient? That's an exponential increase in danger if you're keeping track.\n\nOne Alia Sunsoar went south with a pair of tuskarr to investigate the Sundered Flame. She should have been back by now.\n\nPlease find her and stop the Sundered Flame from acquiring the artifact!",
