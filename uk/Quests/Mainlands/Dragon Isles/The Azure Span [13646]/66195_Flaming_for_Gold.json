    "Description": "Our scouts noticed that there were artifacts frozen in the falls and rivers of the Winterpelt Hollow.\r\n\r\n I have just the thing, the Ice Panning Focuser Mark 15, or I.P.F. for short. I think we have all of the bugs worked out so take it and use it to defrost the likely frozen relics. \r\n\r\nOnce you have 10, bring them back and I will put our researchers to work identifying them.",
