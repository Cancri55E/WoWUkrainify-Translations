    "Description": "Centuries ago, I made a vow of friendship and cooperation with the first centaur. Although much has changed, I feel it is time for us to renew that vow again.\n\nA recitation was composed to help future generations of centaur remember their bond with the green dragonflight. Each verse must be answered with an offering from the khans. I hope the centaur can still remember the original meanings.\n\nThe choice of gift is critical. Choose the right offering, and our allegiance is bound.",
