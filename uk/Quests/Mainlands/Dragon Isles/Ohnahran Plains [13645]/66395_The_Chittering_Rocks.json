I suspect Primalists will try to invade these lands again. Unlike last time, I doubt they'll attack the Ancient Bough directly. They know we'd defeat them.\n\nSee those rocks over there? Those off-color, slightly smelly rocks? I hear something moving underneath them. Perhaps Primalists are lurking nearby! Could you investigate? Squash whatever you find.",

Now I can contemplate... other things.\n\nWhile you were hunting, Rymek and I had a lovely conversation. He's quite undrstanding and sympathetic. In a way, he reminds me of Solethus...\n\nHe asked if he could see the portal to the Emerald Dream with his own eyes. I see no reason why not, especially since you've cleared those spiders away. I'm sure he'll be quite impressed.",
