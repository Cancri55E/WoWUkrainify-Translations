    "Description": "According to this survivor, the centaur took them completely by surprise. Bovan led many of the braves against the centaur, hoping to buy time for the others to escape. \n\nHe succeeded, but Bovan and most of the braves have not returned. We must find him, $n.\n\nI need you to search the surrounding area. If you find survivors, tell them to make their way back here.\n\nIf you find fallen tauren... take something recognizable to bring back to their families.",
