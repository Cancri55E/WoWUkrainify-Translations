    "Description": "Based on my research, I believe there's a way to reestablish Ysera's ties to the Emerald Dream, so we can bring her closer to Azeroth.\n\nWhen Ysera died, the Winter Queen used her own power to restore her in Ardenweald. For now, she's bound there, but I think if we can just get Ysera over into the Emerald Dream, we can use these anchors to keep her there.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of everything.\n\nFirst, we have to infuse these anchors with the power of those Emerald Tears.",
