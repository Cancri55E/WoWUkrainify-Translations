    "Description": "A tribe of tauren came to the Dragon Isles led by a close friend of mine, Bovan Windtotem. No one has heard from them since they entered these plains.\n\nIf they have gone missing, then I must find them. Unfortunately, I underestimated the size of this place. \n\nYou have an existing relationship with the centaur. Will you go speak with them and see if they have any information on Bovan or his tribe? \n\nPerhaps they can help narrow down my search.",
