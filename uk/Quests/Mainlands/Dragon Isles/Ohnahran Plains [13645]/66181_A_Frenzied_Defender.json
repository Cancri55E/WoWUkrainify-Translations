    "Description": "I have noticed that these gardens have rather diverse defenses, from the dragons to the drakonid and ancients... and even the wildlife!\n\nBut there is one defender that seems to have become rather too zealous in its protectiveness. It even tried to swoop at me when I arrived!\n\nAnd since we know something has been killing within these groves, it cannot hurt to be too cautious.\n\nUnfortunately, this creature must be slain before it can do more damage.",
