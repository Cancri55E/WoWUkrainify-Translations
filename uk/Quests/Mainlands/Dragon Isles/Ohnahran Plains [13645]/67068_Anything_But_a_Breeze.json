Just the other day, our stable master, Marren, almost fell to her death trying to tame one.\n\nShe's pretty proud, so she blamed it on the breezehunter itself. Told me that if it didn't think her eggs were being attacked, it wouldn't have been so aggressive as to bully her off the cliff's edge.\n\nI guess that means that you might find the eggs you're looking for out there? It was to the east, just around the mountainside here.",
