    "Description": "No doubt you have seen the destruction that Fyrakk continues to leave in his wake.\n\nWhile others fight him directly, my troops and I have been serving as the eyes and ears of the green dragonflight. Although Fyrakk's actions may seem erratic, there are trends to his strategies.\n\nWe learned that he is to have a secret meeting with Vyranoth soon in Lunedane. This is a deviation from his recent tactics, and we need to know why.\n\nGiven the danger, we would value your aid. Meet me in Lunedane.",
