This outsider tore through our ranks like a tempest. \n\nIf the Nokhud have allies who can wreak this much havoc, we must find out as much as we can about them.\n\nI have sent my ohuna, Altan, to find this outsider. She has not flown back, and I am concerned. $n, can you search for clues about this outsider and see what has become of Altan?",
