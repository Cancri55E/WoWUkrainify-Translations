    "Description": "As soon as we arrived, Baine was whisked away. Bovan is still missing, so he is speaking to someone named Tagar.\n\nOf course I've been left out here in the cold. It seems they still don't trust me.\n\nIn any case, you should go in and speak with the tauren. Take the items you found and try to identify who they belonged to. At the very least, you can let the families know what we've discovered so far.\n\nBut... be gentle, $n. For some of them, this may be the worst day of their lives.",
