    "Description": "I received an interesting letter from Ohn'iri Springs.\n\nAs for the letter's contents, it details, quote, horrid imprisonment, controlling mentors, and extreme boredom. It is formally signed by Initiate Radiya. There's also a sketch of an eagle... kicking a centaur named Meluun off a cliff.\n\nWell. I suppose this is a call for help, if you are so inclined to see for yourself. To be frank, I think Radiya is probably okay. She sends me such letters often.",
