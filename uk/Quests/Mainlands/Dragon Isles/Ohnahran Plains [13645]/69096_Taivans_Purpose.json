I have healed all of their physical wounds, but they have not eaten or said a word to anyone since we found them. They just sit and stare. \n\nThis is beyond my skills, and I am at a loss. Will you try to talk to them, $n?",

He is different from other bakar, yes, but he has proven himself a valuable member of Clan Teerai. He will stay by my side for the rest of his days, rescuing who he can, and healing who I cannot.\n\nPlease, come and visit us anytime you'd like! We are both truly grateful for all you have done for us!",
