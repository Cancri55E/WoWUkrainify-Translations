    "Description": "We may've only recently returned to the Emerald Gardens, relatively speaking, but we carry our long-lasting feelings with us.\n\nMany of us are still reeling from the death of Ysera, my grandmother. Including myself. I wish I had gotten to spend more time with her and to learn more from her. What amazing things she's seen in her life!\n\nIn places like the Emerald Gardens, when we shed tears, they can crystalize and carry great power within them. I have an idea for how this galvanized grief could help us.",
