Impeccable timing!\n\nI just met with Lord Commander Turalyon and his allies, and they have accepted the Aspects' invitation to the Dragon Isles. \n\nYou will be coming along, of course? It wouldn't be the same without you!\n\nI imagine you have noticed some unfamiliar faces gathered here. The ones with the wings are called dracthyr. They have only known me a short time, but they are already great admirers.\n\nAh, but where are my manners? We should have a chat.",
