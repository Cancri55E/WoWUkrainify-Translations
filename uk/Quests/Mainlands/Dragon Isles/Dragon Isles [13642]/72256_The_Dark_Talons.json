    "Description": "Naleidea is enthusiastic, but she's a historian, not a soldier. She knows nothing of the dangers we'll face in the Dragon Isles.\n\nNot that anyone needs to worry. After all, the Dark Talons will be protecting the expedition.\n\nI'm going to discuss mission logistics with Ebyssian and your Horde leaders.\n\nMy lieutenant, Kodethi, is exploring the city along with the other dracthyr. Be a good soldier and let him know we are going to rally at the zeppelin tower. He'll relay my orders to the others.",
