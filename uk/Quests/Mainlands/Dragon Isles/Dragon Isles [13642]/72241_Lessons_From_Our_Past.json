Wrathion aided us after we awakened from our long stasis, and now it is my turn to help him.\n\nNo doubt you have questions about my people and our history. Until recently, I did as well. \n\nBut Nozdormu, the Timeless One, has revealed lost truths about the dracthyr. He granted me a vision of our origins... and why we were locked away. \n\nLet me tell you of the things I have seen.",
