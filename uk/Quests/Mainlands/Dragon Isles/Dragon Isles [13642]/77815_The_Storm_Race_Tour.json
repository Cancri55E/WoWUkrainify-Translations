    "Description": "This storm gryphon is intriguing! Whatever land gave rise to such a creature merits further exploration.\n\nBut since you are here, let us test its training--and your riding skills.\n\nMy colleagues in the bronze flight have laid out new courses to put the mount through its paces. When a timekeeper sees you upon your gryphon, they will offer you the chance to fly these \"storm races\".\n\nFortune favors the bold, $n. Good luck!",
