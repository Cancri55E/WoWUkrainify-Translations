    "Description": "A new face! Pleasure to meet you. I'm Septi. I keep the Shado-Pan fighting.\n\nThe mantid have poison that chews through the skin and infects the blood. It makes for a slow, excruciating death when not treated.\n\nI need pollen from the violet citron flowers. The nearest place to find them is around Dampsoil Burrow just north of the battlefront. If you happen to go in that direction, could you bring some back for me?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 10 Violet Citron.",
    "CompletionText": "Mixed properly, the pollen from these flowers can eat away at the poison without doing any lasting damage to the body otherwise.",
    "RewardText": "Marvelous. And in good condition too!\n\nThank you, kind $c.",
