Mantid from Kri'vess constantly attack the Gai-Cho yaungol, who hold them off at their front gates.\n\nI want you to wreak havoc. \"Borrow\" some highly explosive oil barrels from camp Gai-Cho, and toss them down onto the battlefield from the air.\n\nI don't care which ones you kill, just kill a lot of them.",
