The camp's cannoneers developed an improvised explosive that's made from the globe seeds down the western ridge.\n\nThey dispatched a couple initiates to bring some back hours ago, but have heard nothing from them. I want to send someone a bit more capable to make sure that this gets taken care of.\n\nAre you my $gman:woman; for this?",
