    "Title": "Into the Wilds",
    "Description": "Deep in the wilds, on the southern coast where the Krasarang River meets the sea, rests the Temple of the Red Crane, home of the great Chi-Ji and his most devout followers.\n\nThey should be told of what happened here.\n\nIf you're headed that way, I have a favor to ask; We often send supplies to the temple, but our last courier has not returned. Please look for signs of him as you travel - where the road forks at the Dojani River, he'd have gone south. When you reach the temple, find Koro Mistwalker.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Locate the missing Zhu's Watch Courier in the southern area of the Dojani River, then continue on to the Temple of the Red Crane and speak with Koro Mistwalker.",
    "RewardText": "I see... And the sha have seeped out as far as the province already, have they?\n\nWell, I hate to break it to you, but the temple is also overrun with sha. Those of us who haven't been killed or... possessed, or whatever, are fleeing for our very lives.\n\nIf you defeated the sha at Zhu's Watch, I have to implore you to help us deal with them here.\n",
