Thing about hunting with Nesingwary is you need to prove you can keep your tally and bragging rights up.\n\nCan't hunt, can't brag. And I like bragging so this is no good.\n\nCan I hire you to go kill me some carp hunters? You'll find them up and down the river west of here. There are a bunch of them so don't hesitate to hunt while doing other stuff.",
