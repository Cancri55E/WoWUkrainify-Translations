    "Description": "The mogu found the Pools of Youth!\n\nMama Bramblestaff used to tell me old stories about those. During the mogu empire they would use the waters to extend life.\n\nThing is those stories never ended well for some reason. As if the waters were cursed.\n\nEither way, we should investigate. There is a good chance those waters might help Leza.\n\nIt looks like the Pools of Youth are on the northwestern side of the ruins.",
