    "Description": "Bonfires are surprisingly effective at discouraging beasts from wandering out of the wilds. We have three along the border to the southwest which we normally keep lit at all times.\n\nNobody's been there for days, though, and the fires must be out by now. It's only a matter of time before the wilds creep back in and overtake the land we have kept safe for centuries.\n\nPlease, re-ignite the bonfires. They are critical in keeping the province safe, and they are memorials to the founders of our way of life.",
