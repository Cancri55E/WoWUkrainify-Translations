    "Description": "All of this started with our ponds. In a single day, all of the water retreated down into the earth. When there was no more water in the ponds, it began to fall from the sky.\n\nDespite endless torrents of rain, the ponds do not fill. It's as if the land itself thirsts and cannot be quenched.\n\nNow the ponds birth horrific manifestations of despair. Elementals made of water from the sky and salt from the earth; the tears of Pandaria.",
