    "Description": "In times like these, it becomes necessary for all of the denizens of the Vale to pitch in and do their part. Unfortunately, I have never been much of a fighter, so my usefulness in times of war is limited.\n\nHowever, I may be able to do some good. You see, we know very little about the invaders we face, and knowledge can be a very powerful weapon.\n\nI think I have seen tomes carried by some of the k'thir. If you could bring some to me, I may be able to glean something useful from their writings.",
