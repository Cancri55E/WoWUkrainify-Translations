You know what awesome thing happened to me this morning?\n\nI was strolling through the ruins with Anji, eyes on the ground so I wouldn't step on anymore of those creepy spider pods, when one of the statues came to life and tried to smash me!\n\nAnji ended up doing the smashing. But I'm not satisfied. I think that you should go out there and smash all the statues, whether they're moving or not. It's the only way to be sure.",
