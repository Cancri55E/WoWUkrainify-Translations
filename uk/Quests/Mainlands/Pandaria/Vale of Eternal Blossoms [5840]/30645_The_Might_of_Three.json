This is the end.\n\nIf we don't drive the mogu from the valley, they will seize the remnants of their ancient power and use it to break Pandaria to their will.\n\nBut our forces are few, and tired, and small. We bleed, while their warriors are made of stone.\n\n$n, although all odds are against us, still I must ask you to go and help our forces slay the mogu invaders.\n\nI have prayed to the Celestials, begging their aid. I can only hope that they answer our call.",
