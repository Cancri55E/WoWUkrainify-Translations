She's taken some others over the hills to the southeast, just past the Raptor Rise. If you follow the path east out of town and follow it south at the fork, you can't miss her.\n\nApparently there's some trouble or other brewing with the snake-men at the ruins on the shore. Go see if you can't sort it all out, would you?",
