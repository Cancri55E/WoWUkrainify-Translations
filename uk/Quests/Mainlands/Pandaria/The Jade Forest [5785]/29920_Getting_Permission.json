    "Title": "Getting Permission",
    "Description": "My love, Lo, tried to get permission to marry me from the pandriarchs. Though they have passed beyond, their favor would carry a lot of weight.\n\nThing is, they are spirits, and none of the gifts or tributes we brought impress them. To win their favor they claimed that either Lo or a champion must defeat them in single combat.\n\nLo is a good man, but not a fighter.\n\nWould you be our champion?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Challenge and defeat Pandriarch Goldendraft, Pandriarch Windfur, and Pandriarch Bramblestaff.",
    "CompletionText": "Each of the pandriarchs earned their reputation in life and retained them afterward.  I can't even imagine how you will defeat them.",
    "RewardText": "They... they agreed?! Fantastic! Thank you so much! With their blessing we can be the happiest pandaren in all the land!\n\nPlease, take this. We meant it to be a tribute for the pandriarchs but they didn't seem interested.",
