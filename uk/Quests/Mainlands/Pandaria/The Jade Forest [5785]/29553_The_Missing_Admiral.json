According to the clues you found, that was Anduin's ship, and Admiral Taylor was the captain. \n\nAnd Admiral Taylor's last entry says he was going to fight off the hozen and protect the vessel after the shipwreck.\n\nThe locals say these hozen sometimes take prisoners, and I didn't see Taylor's corpse anywhere among the wreckage. So you'll probably find Taylor at the hozen encampment to the northeast.\n\nGet going, we have no time to lose!",
