So many good warriors lost...\n\nThere must have been a few survivors who were able to bail during the crash. We need every able-bodied fighter we can get.\n\nFind as many survivors as you can in the forest below, and I will investigate the wreckage itself. Rally everyone together at the nearby village for a counter-attack.",
