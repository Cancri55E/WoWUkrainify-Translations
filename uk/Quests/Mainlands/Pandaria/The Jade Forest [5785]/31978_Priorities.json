All that brew gone to waste!\n\nTaran Zhu warned us against speaking to you outsiders, but I'll take any help I can get.\n\nWe were on our way to Dawn's Blossom to deliver our brew when the fighting broke out. Now all of our brew has been lost!\n\nYou want to make it up to us? Maybe you can find some of our Honeybrew barrels that haven't been broken. Then it wouldn't be a complete loss.",
