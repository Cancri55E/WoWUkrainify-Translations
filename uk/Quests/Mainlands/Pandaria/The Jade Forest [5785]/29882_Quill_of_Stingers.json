    "Description": "To achieve perfect paint strokes, one must have the right tools. My own have fallen into disrepair, their bristles becoming as unmanageable as hozu hair.\n\nHave you seen the wasps throughout the Arboretum? Their stingers can be fashioned into quills that provide just the right level of sharpness in each line.\n\nCould you gather some for me please? ",

    "CompletionText": "Have you been able to acquire some stingers? I would normally ask a monk for help with this but they all seem to be elsewhere at the moment.",
    "RewardText": "My thanks traveler. These will make a fine set of quills. Here is something for your trouble.",
