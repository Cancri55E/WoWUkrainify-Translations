Clearly, this land has a deep history, which means it could not have been born of the cataclysm.\n\nAnd yet these waters have been explored for ages now, with no record of anything here but open sea.\n\nPerhaps if you were to sketch the pieces of this broken statue, you might shed light on the continent's origins.",
