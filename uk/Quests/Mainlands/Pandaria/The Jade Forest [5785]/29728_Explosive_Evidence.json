We'll have to destroy it.\n\nI cobbled together some Makeshift Dynamite from the scraps you brought me.\n\nPlace the dynamite anywhere on the ship, but take care not to put them too close together.\n\nThey might be...uh...a little unwieldy, so you should spread them out in case of premature detonation.",
