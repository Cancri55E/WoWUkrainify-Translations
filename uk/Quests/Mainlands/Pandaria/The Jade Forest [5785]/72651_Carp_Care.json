    "Description": "The village carp bring fortune and peace. Their well-being reflects the health of the village.\n\nThe carp thrive on special food made from worm meal and vegetable paste. It's not as unpleasant as it sounds, especially after we finish dehydrating it into neat little blocks.\n\nHere! Just toss it gently in the water near them.\n\nTheir ponds also require cleaning, so please skim any debris you find.",
