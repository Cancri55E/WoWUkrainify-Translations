    "Description": "Kirygosa wrote me after leaving Stranglethorn some years ago. She said it was beautiful and balmy, but not very quiet. I presume--and hope--she has found peace in Pandaria.\n\nIf I am honest with myself, I should not be surprised that she hasn't answered the Isles' call. Yet, we must do our duty and seek her out. If I am doubly honest with myself, I would have any excuse to see her again.\n\nLet us take a break from these chilly winds and visit the Jade Forest.",
