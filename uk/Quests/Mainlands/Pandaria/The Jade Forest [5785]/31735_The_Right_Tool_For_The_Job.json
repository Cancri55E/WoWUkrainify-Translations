    "Description": "I've scouted the area and found no leads on the prince or Admiral Taylor. We need to neutralize this base quickly and continue our search elsewhere.\n\nOperations here are being led by an orc warlock; Ga'trul. He's barricaded the dock and is trying to escape through a demonic circle.\n\nPut that flaregun to work again and blow those barricades! I'll cover your back and move in when you reach Ga'trul.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Use Sully's Flaregun to clear out the barricades and confront Ga'trul at the end of the dock.",
    "CompletionText": "We will complete our mission, but right now our priority is that warlock!",
    "RewardText": "We'll catch up with him again. I'm sure of it.",
