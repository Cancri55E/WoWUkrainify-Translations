The training grounds are behind you, but now you must prove yourself by facing a far greater challenge, one that none of my students have accomplished.\n\nI want you to return Huo, the spirit of fire, to the Temple of Five Dawns.\n\nMy two other most gifted students will help you in this task. The first is Aysa Cloudsinger. Seek her out at the pool to the west.",
