    "Description": "Shu, the spirit of water, is eternally young, as are all the spirits of Shen-zin Su. I have been friends with Shu all of my life, but I no longer have it within me to play with him. I am old, and lack the energy.\n\nFor all his complexities, Shu is simple to please: he desires friendship. When I returned to play with Shu each season, I would always bring a Sun Pearl as a gift, and then we would play together. You can find a Sun Pearl in the pools to the southeast. Perhaps you can be his new friend.",

    "RewardText": "Shu's desires are not so different from our own. He does not want to be alone. Unwanted, unloved. He longs to be needed, and to share his life with others.\n\nKnowing that, earning his trust is not terribly difficult. He just wants company.",
