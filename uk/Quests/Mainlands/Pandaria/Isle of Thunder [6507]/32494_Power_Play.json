These items are often passed from one generation to another, each recipient adding to the item's power.\n\nTwo such items exist here. To be specific, two masks, worn by two brothers.\n\nSpiritbinder Tu'chek and Arcanital Ra'kul must be stopped and their masks destroyed.\n\nKill them and return their masks to me. I will make sure the masks are disposed of.",
