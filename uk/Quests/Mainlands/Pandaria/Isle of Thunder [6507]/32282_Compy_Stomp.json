    "Description": "The raptors and compies of the Zandalari represent a substantial threat to our forces here. They are superb hunting beasts that can track prey over great distances and are often lethal to encounter when caught unawares.\n\nI need you to head into the Beast Pens and cull their numbers. We need to make sure to slay them before they are fully trained.",
