Masters of lightning, ancient and powerful spirits, and primal Zandalari monstrosities.\n\nIf you can get your hands on some of the Shan'ze Ritual Stones scattered across the isle, you should be able to beckon these powerful opponents out of hiding and strike out at them.\n\nFind and destroy members of each group to keep them destabilized, and I will make it worth your time.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Use Shan'ze Ritual Stones to perform the Lightning Ritual, the Spirit Ritual, and the Primal Ritual at various locations across the Isle of Thunder, and then defeat the powerful opponents that are summoned forth.",
