    "Description": "We assault the mogu at the Court of Bones, but I fear we merely send them fodder for their abominable rituals.\n\nThe mogu do not merely kill their prisoners - they steal their souls and imbue them in machinations of stone, or reforge the fallen into ghostly tools of war.\n\nAlliance or Horde, it matters not. We cannot allow the mogu to bolster their numbers.\n\nGo into the crypts. Free any prisoners that are still living.",
