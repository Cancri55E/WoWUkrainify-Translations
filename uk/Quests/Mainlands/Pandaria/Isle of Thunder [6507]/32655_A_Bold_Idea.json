    "Description": "Zandalari warships plunder the seas around this island. They ferry in soldiers and war beasts from Zandalar to bolster Lei Shen's army.\n\nIf we can capture the palace shipyard, the Thunder King's supply line will be cut off, and your foothold here will be secure.\n\nI have a plan to do just that, and it won't take an entire army.",

That warship won't be raining fire on us again any time soon.\n\nTaran Zhu has informed me that the Shado-Pan will keep vigil over Stormsea Landing, freeing up Kirin Tor resources to press the siege elsewhere. Taoshi will be there. I am sure she will be glad to work with you again.\n\nWe are all grateful for your contributions, $n. Thank you.",
