They are powerful magic users and should not be underestimated.\n\nTheir power seems to stem from the ornate masks they wear; relics passed down from one generation to the next. Each owner imbuing it with their own magic before passing it on.\n\nWe must deal with the brothers and destroy their masks before they fall into the wrong hands.",
