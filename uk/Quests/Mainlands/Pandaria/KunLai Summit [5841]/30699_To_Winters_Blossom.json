    "Title": "To Winter's Blossom",
    "Description": "The battle against the Sha is eternal - we can not leave this place. \n\nBut I am troubled by the absence of reinforcements from the Monastery given that we sent for them days ago. \n\nYou have performed admirably, perhaps you could travel to Winter's Blossom, our base camp on the way to the Shado-Pan Monastery. Speak with Lin Silentstrike once you arrive - he should know what is happening. To get there, travel north of the village and follow the road through Shado-Li Basin to Winter's Blossom.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak with Lin Silentstrike at Winter's Blossom in Kun-Lai Summit.",
    "RewardText": "Shado-Master Chong sent you, hmm?\n\nYes, we received his request for reinforcements.\n\nWe are in no position to grant it, however. We've just concluded a battle of our own, and the monastery's been locked up tight. \n\nWe can't even get reinforcements here, and we're just down the hill!",
