    "Description": "Our new recruits have spoken in hushed tones about a group of Pandaren they call the \"Shado-Pan\". They are apparently very strong, and secretive.\n\nIt's clear that, no matter what happens here in Kun-Lai, making an alliance with these Shado-Pan will be critical to our foothold in Pandaria.\n\nThat's where you come in. Rumor is they have a base of operations to the southeast, near Firebough Nook.\n\nYou will go there, and curry their favor. For the Horde!",
