    "Description": "They are attacking again!\n\n<Lin looks to the Ox Gate.>\n\nArchers... on the wall!\n\nI need you to get up there. My wife Suna went to scout the wall with that fool Lao-Chen. Perhaps if he had spent more time preparing defenses and less building that ridiculous ale lift contraption...\n\nIt matters not. Get a kite from Len, to the west, and then get up there and find my wife. She'll know what to do next.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak to Kite Master Len at Winter's Blossom in Kun-Lai Summit to take a kite up to the Ox Gate. Once there, speak to Suna Silentstrike.",
    "RewardText": "Wow, that was quite a bit of kite-flying there. Good job getting up here and not dying.\n\nIt's good you're here, too. Lao-chen's got an idea he's working on, but in the meantime we've got yaungol to deal with.",
