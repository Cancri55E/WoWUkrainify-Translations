    "Description": "It was a crazy idea: kafa berries go in the goot, seeds come out.\n\nKafa'kota is already rare and worth a fortune, but my cousin's invention--Kafa'goot--is GOURMET.\n\nBut it's over now. Uncle Keenbean is upset and peak is a muss. All that's left is to collect the rest of the Kafa'goot and never make it again.\n\nI won't ask you to gather it--kind of a mussy task, not fit for hero-- just mark it so we can find it easily when the mountain is safe again.",
