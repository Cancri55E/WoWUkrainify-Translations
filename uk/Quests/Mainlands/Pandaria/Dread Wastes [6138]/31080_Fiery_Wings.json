    "Description": "I think that old paper said something about \"fiery wings.\" Those little dragons around here have wings. They're kind of fiery, in a way.\n\nYou're quicker than me. Try catching some of those dragons... or at least slapping the powder off of them.\n\nNo point in killing a harmless little dragon, if all you want is the sparkle from their wings.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Slap Rikkilea Flitterlings, then catch 88 flecks of Flitterling Dust.",
    "CompletionText": "I haven't been able to catch any of those things!",
    "RewardText": "YEAH!!! FLITTERLING DUST!!!\n\n<Olon throws the powder into the pot.>\n\nThis brew is turning out... strange, and pretty smelly. I'm starting to think maybe Lya was right.",
