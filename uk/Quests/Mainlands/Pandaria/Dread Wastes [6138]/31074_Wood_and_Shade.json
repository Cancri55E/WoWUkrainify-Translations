I know that they maintain shrines within their settlement, Kor'vess.\n\nOne is a heartroot of the very tree that they inhabit. The other is a dark pillar, connecting them with their queen.\n\nThese shrines are the wood and shade. If my predictions are right... the daggers should react in their presence.",
