Everything the Klaxxi have done, the empress knows about.\n\nThat stops now!\n\nKypari Ik will be the first to receive news of Kor'ik's demise. It would benefit us to make sure that message does not make it to the empress.\n\nDestroying the whisperers and beacon there will buy us enough time to come up with a plan before the empress can act.",
