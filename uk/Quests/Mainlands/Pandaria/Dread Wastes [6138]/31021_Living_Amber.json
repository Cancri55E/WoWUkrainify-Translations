    "Description": "Liquid amber is most efficient for restoring a newly awakened paragon's strength, and is usually provided at a wakening ceremony.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems you did not receive these instructions, so we shall have to improvise.\n\nI can sense a vast quantity of fossilized amber in the lake below us. It will serve, but I am too weak to dig it up myself.\n\nDo this for me, and I will see to it that you are rewarded.",

    "CompletionText": "Do you understand, Wakener? The amber gives life.",
