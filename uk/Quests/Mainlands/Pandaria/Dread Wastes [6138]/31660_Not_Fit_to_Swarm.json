    "Description": "Newly hatched mantid have only two instincts: kill and feed. They turn on one another, devouring the weak and leaving the strongest to mature.\n\nThose hatched during a swarm - the swarmborn - are turned loose on our enemies instead.\n\nThe swarmborn in the Clutches of Shek'zeer have been tainted. They are born into shadows and nightmares. Driven by terror, not hunger.\n\nThey are not fit to swarm. They must be purged.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Slay 30 Shek'zeer Swarmborn in the Clutches of Shek'zeer.",
    "CompletionText": "Let me know if you want to be dropped into a sea of swarmborn. It would entertain me greatly.",
    "RewardText": "Their eggs should have basked in the warmth of the sun and the song of a million wings for ten more years.\n\nThe Empress will pay for her crimes.",
