    "Description": "What is that tree on the hill to the west? Can it be... Kypari Zar?\n\n<Korven the Prime lapses into silence.>\n\nWhen I returned from my final ravage, before being elevated to a paragon, I was given the honor of planting that very tree.\n\nI see it has grown into a great kypari, but... it seems something is amiss.\n\nThere is an old sonar tower at the base of the tree. Take me there, Wakener. I can use the tower to take a closer look.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Activate the Sonar Tower, then defend Korven the Prime as he examines the tree.",
    "CompletionText": "What has happened to our home? Things feel amiss.",
    "RewardText": "Once, great rivers of amber coursed through this tree's veins. Now, it is but a dried husk.",
