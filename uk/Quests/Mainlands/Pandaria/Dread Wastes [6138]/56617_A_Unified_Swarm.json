It stands to reason that they are keeping a stockpile of it somewhere.\n\nThe Shado-Pan's scouts have been reporting an increased presence of the swarm's warriors in Klaxxi'vess. I would wager that they are guarding the corrupted amber.\n\nMeet me there. If we have a chance to destroy that amber, then we need to take it.",
