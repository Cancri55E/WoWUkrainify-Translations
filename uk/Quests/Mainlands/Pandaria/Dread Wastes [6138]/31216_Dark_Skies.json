They shall not stop the dark march until their bodies are laid open and bleeding upon the ground.\n\nThis we shall gladly do. We will attack them from above. While I fly, use my poisons to destroy their advance.\n\nDo not mix the two serums until you are ready to attack. The reaction can be quite... violent.\n\nSpeak to me when you are ready to go.",
