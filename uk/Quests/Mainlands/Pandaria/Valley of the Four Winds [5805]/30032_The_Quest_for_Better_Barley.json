    "Description": "Looking for sweet grain? My father once mentioned a malted cave barley that sounds about right.\n\nIf you are willing to brave the peril, there is an ancient cave at the base of the Winds' Edge south of here.\n\nThere is even an old lift my father made when he would travel into the jungle.\n\nIn the cave is a bush as old as my family. From that bush you can pluck a grain so sweet it will humble your senses.\n\nJust watch out for its guardians.",
