    "Description": "A few weeks ago, a group of those jumpy little Springtail virmen broke into my lockbox and stole several handfuls of my jewelry. I've since found a few pieces, but they still have most of my collection.\n\nIf you're headed up to the Springtail Crag, in the cliffs to the north, you should keep an eye out for them. I'd love to get my jewelry back.",
