    "Description": "Like any farming community, we have the occasional virmen troubles.\n\nThe most powerful Springtail virmen live high up in the cliffs to the north, and only come down when they run out of veggies to nibble on.\n\nFrankly, I've dealt with virmen before. They're nothing but a pest that must be kept in check, and there's no better way to do that than by killing their warren-mother. Easy as that.",
