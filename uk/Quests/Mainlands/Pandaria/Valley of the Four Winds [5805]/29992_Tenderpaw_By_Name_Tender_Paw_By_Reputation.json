He says I have to pass that test of bamboo first.\n\n<Lin whispers:> How'd you do that, by the way?\n\nIt looks like, for the time being, I'm stuck here practicing my punches against this rock. And my knuckles are about to cave in.\n\nIf you could gather some jademoon leaves, I could prepare an ointment and at least numb some of this pain.",
