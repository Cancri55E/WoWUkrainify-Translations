    "Description": "Sometimes I feel sad for Jogu. He's the only jinyu around, and I don't think he has any friends. Other than his smelly bottle, of course.\n\nYou know what? I've got an idea. Farmer Yoon has a basket of craneberries inside his house, and a few apples as well. I'm sure you could bring them to the stillmaster in the Halfhill Market and get him to brew something special for Jogu.",
