    "Description": "I been thinkin'.\n\nWe got all this beer that Chen brewed, and we got all these people that you've gathered. We should bring the two together.\n\nThere's a bunch o' folks out there in the fields, riskin' their lives for Pandaria. You an' I should at least bring 'em a keg or two.\n\nThey might raise their mugs in victory. They might enjoy one last drink before gettin' skivvered by a mantid. Either way, I wouldn't want 'em to fight without a good brew in their belly.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Bring beer to Zhu's Wardens, the Crane Wing Priests, the Shado-Pan, and the night elf settlers.",
    "RewardText": "Nothing makes a pandaren happier than an untapped keg. Chen's beer may not have improved anyone's fighting skills today, but it certainly improved their morale.",
