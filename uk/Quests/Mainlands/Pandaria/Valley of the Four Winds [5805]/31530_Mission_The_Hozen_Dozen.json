    "Description": "I've been watching the hozen since I arrived, and I don't like the pattern of activity that I'm seeing in their camp.\n\nMultiple hozen travel down the mountain under the cover of night, pillaging supplies from the farmlands below.\n\nWe must stop their rampant theft. I have been thinning their numbers when I can, but one soldier alone is not enough.\n\nI need your help. Kill as many of the hozen as you can.",
