    "Description": "Alright, fine. I DON'T have everything under control here. I spent all morning fighting off virmen. I managed to clear them off of my property, but they got away with some of my crops.\n\nThey took them down to the river, to the south. I have no idea what they're doing with them, but it's probably not eating them.\n\nIf my father wants his delivery now, I'm going to need some help getting those crops back. Could you help me out?",
