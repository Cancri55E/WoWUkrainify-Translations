I thought they were all false... until I saw that giant hozen.\n\nSo, it got me thinkin', what if the other rumors are true? I heard this one rumor just the other day about some water sprites that run around inside the brewery, causin' a ruckus and whatnot. Their bodies are actually MADE OF WATER.\n\nI reckon a man could make some mighty fine beer with some fancy water like that. If you find any, could you bring me some?",
