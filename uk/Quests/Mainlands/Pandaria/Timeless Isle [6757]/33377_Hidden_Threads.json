My flight has little power to repair it, now. We must be careful.\n\nThe hourglass grows in power. I believe it can now be used to see much further than before. I wish you to push it to its limits.\n\nReturn to the Siege of Orgrimmar, and focus the hourglass on the most devastating timeway you can find.",
