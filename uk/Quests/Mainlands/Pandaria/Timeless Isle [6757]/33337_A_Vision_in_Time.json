    "Description": "Look at how the Vision reacts! Astounding! Even now it shows shadows of timeways that flit around us constantly. Though not true sands of the Hourglass of Time, the finely-ground epoch stones certainly have a power all their own. Our first task is to use them to calibrate the Vision of Time.\n\nTake the Vision of Time to a location where history is in the making: the Siege of Orgrimmar. Once there, turn the hourglass and see what happens.",
