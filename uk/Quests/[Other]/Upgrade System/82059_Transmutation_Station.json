    "Description": "My friend, these Crests are magnificent. It seems they can be transformed into different levels of Crest!\n\nIf you find yourself with a multitude of a lower-strength crest, you can upgrade it for a more powerful one! I think. I'm still working on that. I'll let you know when I figure it out. But we can transmute to weaker Crests right now!\n\nSee for yourself. Here's a few Carved Harbinger Crests. Speak to me and I can transform them into Weathered Harbinger Crests, all without excess energy or entropy!",
