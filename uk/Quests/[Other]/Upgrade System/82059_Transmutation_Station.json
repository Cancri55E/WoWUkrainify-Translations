    "Description": "My friend, these Crests are magnificent. It seems they can be transformed into different levels of Crest!\n\nIf you find yourself with a multitude of a lower-strength crest, you can upgrade it for a more powerful one! I think. I'm still working on that. I'll let you know when I figure it out. But we can transmute to weaker Crests right now!\n\nSee for yourself. Here's a few Carved Harbinger Crests. Speak to me and I can transform them into Weathered Harbinger Crests, all without excess energy or entropy!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Bring 15 Carved Harbinger Crests to Vaskarn in Dornogal, then trade them for a Pouch of Weathered Harbinger Crests.",
    "CompletionText": "If you lose those Carved Harbinger Crests, you can find more from powerful creatures around Khaz Algar. I've heard there's quite a variety of them!",
    "RewardText": "See? Isn't it remarkable?\n\nI will let you know soon as I figure out how to turn Weathered Harbinger Crests into Carved Harbinger Crests. If my experience with other Crests is any guide, it will takes more of the Weathered Harbinger Crests to go that direction. But weakening Crests? That's easy!",
