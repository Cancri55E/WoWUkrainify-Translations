    "Description": "Tyrande suspected there was something foul happening here in Felwood... and she was right.\n\nHer priestess, Kaylessa, was sent here to purify the moonwell from the fel corruption that plagues this land, in an effort to reclaim that which belongs to us.\n\nNow we have lost one of our sisters and the moonwell still remains corrupted. We cannot let this stand. We will finish what Kaylessa started, and heal the moonwell. \n\nArko'narin has history with this place. I will let her tell you why we are here.",
