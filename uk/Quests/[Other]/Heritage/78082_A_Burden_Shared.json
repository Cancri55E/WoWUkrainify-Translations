    "Description": "The Tishamaat was once a solitary holiday. Each eredar would inscribe a stone with a painful memory we carried. We would reflect on what that memory could teach us then commit to moving forward with that wisdom.\n\nAt last, the stones are dissolved in the Flame of Reprieve, symbolically removing the weight from our souls.\n\nToday, the Tishamaat will be celebrated not in solitude, but as a community.\n\nGather the stones of those who would trust you with them then take them to the flame.",
