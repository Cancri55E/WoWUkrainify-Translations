    "Description": "This is a top secret mission, $n.\n\nWe've had a break in.\n\nA powerful historical artifact was stolen from the Keep... and it looks like the Defias Brotherhood is to blame. We caught one thief, but the other got away.\n\nBut I don't like it, $n... my gut tells me there's more. \n\nI've called in a... specialist on the Brotherhood. Meet us in the basement of the Lion's Pride Inn in Goldshire.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Meet Mathias Shaw in the basement of the Lion's Pride Inn.",
    "CompletionText": "We must recover what was stolen from the Keep, at all costs.",
    "RewardText": "My few interactions with Vanessa told me she isn't interested in the banditry of the old Defias Brotherhood. To her, the Brotherhood meant supporting the downtrodden... those that Stormwind had left behind. \n\nThat, I can respect. \n\nBut most of her Brotherhood continue to engage in thievery from innocent travelers. That's not revolution, that's highway robbery.\n\nShe insists she tries to stop them.",
