    "Description": "With Sironas slain once again, Bloodmyst will finally be able to heal. Her influence was no doubt anchoring the corruption to the land.\n\nIt is another reason to celebrate today. But it is not the true reason I called Hatuun and Arzaal to Azeroth.\n\nI would have them attend the Tishamaat with us.\n\nThe sacrament asks us to reflect on the past and commit to a better future. The unity of our efforts epitomizes that.\n\nI will bring them to the Exodar. Please join us when you are ready.",
