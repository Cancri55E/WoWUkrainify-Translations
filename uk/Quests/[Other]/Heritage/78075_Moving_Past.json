    "Description": "My mother died on a colony planet. My father and I helped each other move past that, but when he died in the siege of Shattrath, watching the walls of his greatest accomplishment crumble to dust... \n\nThere was no one left for me.\n\nSo I worked. And now I have the schematics of my own Shattrath. A better Shattrath.\n\n<Ataanya clenches the lens in her fist then exhales in resignation.>\n\nI'll go to the Exodar--but if Romuul says one word about it, I will make him eat his soldering tool.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Return to Grand Artificer Romuul in the Exodar.",
    "RewardText": "In some ways, getting Ataanya here was a more difficult victory than the fall of Antorus.\n\nLevity aside, I am glad she is here. I knew the Tishamaat would be hard for her. Her father was a great man, and we all mourn his passing.\n\nThis Tishamaat is gearing up to be one for our holo-records! \n\n<Romuul lowers his voice confidingly.>\n\nEven Hatuun is here!",
