    "Description": "My mother died on a colony planet. My father and I helped each other move past that, but when he died in the siege of Shattrath, watching the walls of his greatest accomplishment crumble to dust... \n\nThere was no one left for me.\n\nSo I worked. And now I have the schematics of my own Shattrath. A better Shattrath.\n\n<Ataanya clenches the lens in her fist then exhales in resignation.>\n\nI'll go to the Exodar--but if Romuul says one word about it, I will make him eat his soldering tool.",
