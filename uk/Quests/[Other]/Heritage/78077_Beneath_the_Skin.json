    "Description": "Arzaal and I are of the same mind. We must know the strength of these satyr before we attempt to drive them back with force. Else we may be walking into a fight we cannot win.\n\nI can learn much about my enemies by observing what damage they leave in their wake. \n\nThe wildlife here was corrupted by the Exodar's lingering energies, but I suspect the demons' presence made it worse.\n\nCollect bones from the local wildlife for me. Studying them may give us some clues.",
