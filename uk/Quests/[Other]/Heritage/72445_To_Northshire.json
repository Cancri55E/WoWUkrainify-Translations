    "Description": "Vanessa's care for her people deserves better than a brotherhood of bandits. I am glad to see them part ways. \n\nAnd as spymaster, I'm in no small part relieved.\n\nNow, Northshire. Peasants can become heroes, there. Perhaps your own journey began in that abbey?\n\nIt's also a strong, defensible position to attack Stormwind from. We cannot let it fall!\n\nHurry, to Northshire!",
