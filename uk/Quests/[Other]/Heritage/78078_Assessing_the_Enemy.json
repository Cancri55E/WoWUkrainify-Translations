    "Description": "The Legion may be one entity, but it is vast. The demons that comprise it are as varied as the innumerable worlds they have conquered.\n\nBut I have had no dealings with satyr. From what the Prophet has told me, they seem disorganized. Intelligent certainly, but feral in their malevolence.\n\nI am inclined to believe their recent attacks are random, but perhaps not. Bring me the totems they have scattered across Bloodmyst. I may be able to tell ascertain what, if anything, their end goal is.",
