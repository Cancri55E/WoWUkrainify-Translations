    "Description": "Hey $c, got a tick to help with something?\n\nSome of our favorite customers placed recrafting orders through the Artisan's Consortium, but we haven't heard back from them.\n\nIf you run into them, can you check to make sure they're satisfied with their purchases? Gotta keep customers happy, happy, happy!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Ask the Artisan's Consortium customers if they are happy with their recrafting orders.",
    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Deliver the gear to Mahra Treebender at Forkriver Crossing.",
    "RewardText": "Oh no! Bless their soul... <Mahra looks over the equipment.>\n\nIt's all ruined. Spent too long in the elements. \n\nHere, take this and craft some new armor. Or speak with one of the Crafting Orders clerks next to me or in Valdrakken and have someone do it for you. I suggest something for your wrists or chest.\n\nOne other thing. The quality of these reagents isn't great, but you can always have your new equipment recrafted later to raise its quality.",
