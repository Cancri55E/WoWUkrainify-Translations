If you think so, then let's give you a little practice!\n\nStand near the bonfire and you'll see  braziers with markers flashing above them.  Toss a torch at a marked brazier.  Be quick! Do it before the mark fades if you want credit for the toss!\n\nHit enough marked braziers, then come back here... for your next lesson.",
