    "Description": "Usually, we go to great lengths to avoid busting artifacts open, but I think in this case we'll learn more about the past from what's inside than just staring at a sealed barrel.\n\nThat said, there's someone we should get permission from first. It's her history, after all. In fact, I think she's the only person still around who might have a personal stake in this find.\n\nI'll see to getting this up the cliff. Ask if Atrenosh Hailstone wants to watch us crack 'er open, eh?",
