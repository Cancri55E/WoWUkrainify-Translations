    "Description": "So, you want to learn how to excavate artifacts? You came to the right orc!\n\nTurns out being able to shape the earth is useful when you're trying to get stuff out of the ground. And given how much the elements affect our work, it helps having an elemental to lend a hand.\n\nBut you don't have to be a shaman to master excavation. I've got the elements covered. I'll just walk you through the detail work.",
