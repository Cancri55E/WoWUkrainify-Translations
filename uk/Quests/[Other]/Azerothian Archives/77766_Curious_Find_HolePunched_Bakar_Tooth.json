    "Title": "Curious Find: Hole-Punched Bakar Tooth",
    "Description": "<This milk-tooth came from a young bakar, though the way the bone has yellowed suggests it's thousands of years old.\n\nSomeone has carefully drilled a hole at the top of this tooth to turn it into a bead. Upon closer examination, the tattered remains of a woolen cord can still be seen threaded through it.\n\nEadweard would know how to preserve this find and figure out whom it might belong to.>",
