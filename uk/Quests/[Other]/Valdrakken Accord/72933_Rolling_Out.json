    "Description": "I remember having so much fun rolling these creatures up with my spells. Unfortunately, I fear these old bones will not let me move as quickly as I once did.\n\nI would love for you to give it a shot. Let me live vicariously through you! \n\nThe more creatures you roll up, the bigger the ball becomes. The bigger the ball, the bigger the creature you can roll out.\n\nSpeak to me and I shall give you my special arcane ball to roll up the creatures around here.",
