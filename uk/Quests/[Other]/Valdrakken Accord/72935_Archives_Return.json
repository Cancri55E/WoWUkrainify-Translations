    "Description": "It is not unusual that Malygos and Sindragosa would have such powerful memories. From what I understand, their deaths were particularly painful. Both slain by adventurers.\n\nIt breaks my heart to think of Sindragosa enduring death not once, but twice after being raised by the Lich King.\n\nBut enough of this old dragon's ramblings. Stellagosa and I will meet you back at the Azure Archives.",
