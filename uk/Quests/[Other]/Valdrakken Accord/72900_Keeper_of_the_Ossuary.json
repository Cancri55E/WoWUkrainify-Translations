While I continue to search for the remaining blue dragons, I could use your aid in another matter.\n\nAlexstrasza and I plan on laying to rest the remaining essences of Malygos and Sindragosa. She has held on to their lingering essences after both were slain years ago.\n\nSenegos said there was a time where dragons would be laid to rest in the Veiled Ossuary. Unfortunately, the place is a mess.\n\nHe's gone ahead to clean the area up with Stellagosa. Could you aid them?",
