I suspect this was triggered after attempting to put them to rest. \n\nThey were dormant for a time, but the combined rage of both Malygos and Sindragosa merged together to create this phenomenon. \n\nQuickly, we must make for the Azure Archives and inform Kalecgos and Sindragosa of this!\n\nTogether, we may be able to finally give them the peace that they deserve.",
