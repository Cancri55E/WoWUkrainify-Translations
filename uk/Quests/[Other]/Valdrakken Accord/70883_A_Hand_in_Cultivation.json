The word is that the gardens are in a state of chaos, but I don't know if that is abnormal.\n\nThey assured me that they have it in hand--actually, 'in shovel' is the phrase they used. I am not sure what they are meaning; I am sure they will fill you in. Please, seek them out and they will outfit you appropriately for the situation.",
