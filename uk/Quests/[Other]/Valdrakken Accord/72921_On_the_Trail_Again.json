    "Description": "Ah... the Veiled Ossuary. I was given the task to be a sort of gravekeeper, which included keeping wildlife away from the area.\n\nI had a rather fun spell split up within several tomes kept within this place to deal with such pests. \n\nThe other blue dragons did not approve of my... reckless methods, so I had to keep the tomes hidden.\n\nHere, allow me to cast a spell on you to grant you the sight to find these old tomes.\n\nOnce they are all gathered, we can cleanse this place of the invasive wildlife.",
