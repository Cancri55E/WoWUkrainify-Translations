I wish we could have met in a less... chaotic time.\n\nWe were helping the Kirin Tor study the history of this place just a few moments before the Primalists attacked.\n\nI fear several tomes may still be out there, at risk of being destroyed in this dreadful assault.\n\nPlease, you must recover these tomes! If they're destroyed, the history of this place will be lost.",
