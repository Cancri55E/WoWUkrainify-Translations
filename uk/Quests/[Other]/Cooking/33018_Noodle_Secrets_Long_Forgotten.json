    "Description": "Searching amidst the rubble, you find the fragment of an old sign. Wiping away the dust, you can make out the well-weathered pandaren characters for \"Noodles\" and \"Lin.\"\n\nLooking above, you suspect that the establishment this sign belonged to was situated on the bridge, which now lies in rubble about you. An eatery placed on a bridge sounds very temporary, so its owner would likely live nearby.\n\nPerhaps there is a clue to be found in the village here on the island?",
