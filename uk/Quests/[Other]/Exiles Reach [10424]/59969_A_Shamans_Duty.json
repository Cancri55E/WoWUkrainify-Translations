Only you, for you have been trained in the ways of a shaman.\r\n\r\nThe necrotic energies of this island have ensnared my pack. I need your aid to free them.\r\n\r\nGather veil blossoms from surrounding area. Burn them on the campfire and breath deep of their smoke.\r\n\r\nThen you will be able to see my packmates and release them from their bonds.",
