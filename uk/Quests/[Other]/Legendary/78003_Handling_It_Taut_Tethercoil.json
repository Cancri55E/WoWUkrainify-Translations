    "Title": "Handling It: Taut Tethercoil",
    "Description": "I've read of a root in the Emerald Dream known for its defensive qualities. It binds its tendrils to powerful foes as a way to protect surrounding flora and fauna. A friendly scribe might be able to help you adapt its properties.\n\nIf I could just get my hands on some of that root, I'm sure I could dissect its properties and mold it into something capable of harnessing Fyr'alath's power.\n\nHere are my notes. You should be able to find powerful creatures guarding patches of wild tethercoil. Good hunting.",
