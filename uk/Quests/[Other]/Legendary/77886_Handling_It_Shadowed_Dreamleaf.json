    "Description": "When Fyr'alath's power is at its limit, you will need a grip that can cool itself. It is like standing your ground when a beast charges you: as the battle heats up, you need a way to stay focused.\n\nVarious leathers throughout the Dragon Isles have that cooling property, but I know of something better. Foliage that is routinely exposed to shadowflame would be the best choice for binding the components together. Let us gather what you need.",
