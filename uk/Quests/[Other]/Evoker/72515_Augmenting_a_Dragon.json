    "Description": "Adamanthia!\n\nShe has been imprisoned for ages, trapped in torment. While the dracthyr slept, she suffered.\n\nI can only hope she has not given in to Deathwing's madness during her long imprisonment. The passage of time may have shattered her mind.\n\nBe ready, champion. Should she lash out, aid Ebyssian. Augment his abilities, so he can subdue Adamanthia instead of slaying her.\n\nShe has earned a chance. We must give it to her.",
