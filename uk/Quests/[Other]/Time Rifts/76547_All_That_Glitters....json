    "Description": "<Having recently defeated the Time Anomaly in this timeway, you notice this golden vase glittering.\n\nIt is extremely worn, be it by time or something else. You can't make out the details of its carvings along the edges.\n\nBattered as it is, it still manages to give off a warm light, contrasting the chill here. \n\nIt looks very out of place. Soridormi may be interested in it.>",
