    "Description": "The Primalists are channeling elemental forces through those portals, energizing their entire effort and speeding the production of these suffused ingots.\n\nSoon they will be stabilized enough to allow their elemental allies to pass through to reinforce their position.\n\nWe have to seal them before that happens or the battle may turn against us.\n\nTake this focus and disrupt the portals' protective runes, then we can strike from above. Only together do we stand a chance.",
