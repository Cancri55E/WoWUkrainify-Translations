    "Description": "While you were working, I was inspecting the totemic ruins you retrieved. There has always been something odd about the Hidden Grove. It used to be occupied by a robust population of harmless white hares. Now there are only maddened owlkin and strange totems...\n\nI put the pieces together. It is no masterpiece, but hopefully we can glean a stronger magical effect from the whole.\n\nMaybe it will even make us sprout some feathers and fur. You would think as a blue dragon I would enjoy the cold, but no.",
