    "Description": "I have been learning much about bronze dragons since arriving in Valdrakken. While they take their charge of time seriously, they have found many hobbies for their free time that their magic can aid them with.\n\nMy friend Gorgonzormu swears by his cheeses for all stages of dragon life. He mentioned that he has a type of parmesan that is excellent for bronze whelps. It seems that our hatchling's first meal is figured out!",
