    "Description": "Long ago in Aszuna, young blue whelps from Azurewing Repose often studied magic alongside the elves of Nar'thalas Academy. I have many fond memories of the place, but one stands out among the others.\n\nThe enchanted books, while excellent to study, were quite the rascals. I have heard Lysindra acquired a similar book. I think this would be the perfect pet for Zalethgos!",
