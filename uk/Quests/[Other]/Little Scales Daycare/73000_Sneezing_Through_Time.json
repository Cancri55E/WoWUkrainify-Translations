    "Description": "Zhusa is throwing us for quite the loop, $n.\n\nSince he is so young, his control over time is not fully developed. Unfortunately, he has a strange reflex. Every time he sneezes he disappears, popping up elsewhere in any form! To top it off, he seems to have many allergies.\n\nPlease, help Zhusadormu figure out what he is allergic to so we can keep him in one place!",
