    "Description": "Our magic rune lesson yesterday has apparently bled into today. The whelps are keen on practicing their runes anywhere they can, prudent or not.\n\nThis fascination has led to an interesting playtime period! Please, help us return the toys to their proper place and dispel any runes you come across.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Help put the Little Scales Daycare back into order.",

    "PortraitGiverText": "The sandbox has had enough. All buried treasures now belong to it!",
    "CompletionText": "We really ought to teach them runes for something helpful, like stone polishing...\n\nThat would have gone a long way here.",
    "RewardText": "Thank you for the assistance, $n. That sandbox has a mind of its own! \n\nWe will do our best to keep the whelps from stirring it up again via runes.",
