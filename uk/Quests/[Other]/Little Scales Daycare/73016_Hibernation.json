    "Description": "Posidriss's companion has been helping them with their severe insomnia, but I worry that they are still falling behind other whelps in their connection to the Dream.\n\nPerhaps we can aid them through a pet battle! Green dragons often protect the Dream from the Nightmare, and Wurallie has found the perfect critter for them to practice this on.\n\nIt is mostly harmless.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Help Posidriss defeat the Nightmare critter.",
    "RewardText": "Posidriss was certainly enthusiastic about facing the enemies of the Emerald Dream. I think they learned a lesson as well.\n\nPosidriss will want to join you on some of your future adventures, though you may have to keep them from rushing after the big threats.",
