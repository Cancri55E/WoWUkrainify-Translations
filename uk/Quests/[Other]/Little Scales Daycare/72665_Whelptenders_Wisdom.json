    "Description": "Our egg-tenders report a new clutch of eggs is soon to hatch. Ordinarily, a whelptender would take each newly hatched dragon and raise them with their flight. However, not all dragonspawn are called to the life of a whelptender, and we are short of hands.\n\nGather wisdom from whelptenders of each flight in the gardens below the Lifeshrine. Agapanthus, an experienced whelptender of the blue flight, has offered his services as head of the Little Scales Daycare. But he will need your assistance.",
