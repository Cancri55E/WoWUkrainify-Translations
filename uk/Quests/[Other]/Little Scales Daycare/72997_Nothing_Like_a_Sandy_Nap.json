    "Description": "While red dragons enjoy their surroundings lush and lively, bronze dragons prefer their environments dry and sandy. I am sure you can find many materials for our hatchling's nest in the Temporal Conflux in Thaldraszus.\n\nI have read that bronze whelps also enjoy an appropriately sized basin to curl themselves in. My friend at the inn in the Bronze Enclave has exclaimed often about an excess of bowls... I am sure she would not mind if we took one off her hands.",
