    "Description": "I believe that the only way we can teach Belastrasza to be less self-obsessed is to show her firsthand how it makes others feel.\n\nVorquin are beautiful creatures, but they are incredibly high maintenance companions who need a lot of care.\n\nLysindra in Valdrakken has a baby vorquin for Bela. Perhaps she will learn through getting a taste of her own medicine.",
