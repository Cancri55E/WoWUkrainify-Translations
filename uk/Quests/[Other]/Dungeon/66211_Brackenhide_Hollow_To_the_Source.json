    "Description": "We cannot thank you enough for your aid pushing back the Brackenhide gnolls. \n\nBut they continue to gather, using their foul decay magic from some source deep within Brackenhide Hollow. Worse, we have not heard from the tuskarr in that area for weeks, now.\n\nI fear something terrible is happening there. We must protect our home. Please, gather your forces, find our people, and see what you can do about the decay!",
