    "Description": "I fear that the Prioress may be behind our missing dead-- and our missing baron. Sybaestan has disappeared as well and I don't believe in coincidences. \n\nShe and Sybaestan have taken our recent losses hard. I fear what their overwhelming grief might be doing to their souls. We must confront them and bring them back to sanity... If we can.\n\nTell General Steelstrike what you have learned. We might need her backup. I'll be waiting for you here.",
