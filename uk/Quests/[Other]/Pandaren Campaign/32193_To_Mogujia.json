    "Description": "The Explorer's League sent an expedition north some days ago.\n\nWe haven't heard from them since, and I'd sleep better at night knowing our folks aren't in some sort of trouble.\n\nLast I heard, Brann Bronzebeard was heading toward Mogujia in the Kun-Lai Summit.\n\nFind him and report back with their status. Fennie over there can give you a ride if you need one.",
