He believes you can help negotiate the withdrawal of blood elves there.\n\nThese \"Sunreavers\" claim fealty to the Horde and represent a major threat to the war effort.\n\nNow that our very own Jaina Proudmoore is in charge of the Kirin Tor it should be easy to convince her to remove this Horde threat to her city.\n\nUse the portal here in Lion's Landing to go to the Purple Parlor and lend what aid you can to Prince Anduin.",
