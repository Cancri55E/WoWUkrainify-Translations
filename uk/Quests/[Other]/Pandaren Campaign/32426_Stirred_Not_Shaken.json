    "Description": "Alright, I'll tell you how to find Connelly.\n\nAgent Connelly is currently posing as the high roller, Professor Kilt. He spends most of his time in the Boom Room. Rumor has it he's after one of the fighters for some long forgotten betrayal.\n\nUnfortunately, the lounge is by invitation only. Lucky for you I just happen to have an invitation.\n\nTry not to look too obvious when you walk past the bouncers. If you get caught you didn't get this pass from me.\n\nIn fact you and I have never met!",
