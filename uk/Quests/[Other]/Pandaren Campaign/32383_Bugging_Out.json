    "Description": "I've managed to plant a few bugs around the camp, but there could always be more.\n\nI disguised the bugs to look like statues. They blend in perfectly with the other artifacts lying around.\n\nYour disguise should allow you to move freely around the camp. Just don't go near the dog and don't linger around Garrosh! Nero and Garrosh will see through your disguise.\n\nIf you get caught I can't help you. I can't compromise the mission!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Plant the Cleverly Disguised Bugs in the large tent, near the small tents, and in the supplies.",
    "RewardText": "Well done! Everyone always underestimates the little guys and it is always a grave mistake!",
