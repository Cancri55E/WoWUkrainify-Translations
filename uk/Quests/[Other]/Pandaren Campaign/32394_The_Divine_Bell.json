    "Description": "There's no telling what lies below, so I will lead the initial scouting party myself.\n\nIf your report was correct, then the Korune mogu hid the Divine Bell in the rooms below our very feet.\n\nI have a feeling they would not have left such a precious artifact unguarded.\n\nI could use a capable $c such as yourself to watch my back. Let me know when you're ready.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Kill Dreadweaver Avartu and recover the Divine Bell.",
    "RewardText": "Fantastic work, $n. I could not even imagine the atrocity that Garrosh would commit if this bell were to fall into his hands.\n\nToday, we have secured a safe future for the Alliance. I will see to it that the bell makes it safely to Darnassus.\n\nI will extoll your deeds to the King.",
