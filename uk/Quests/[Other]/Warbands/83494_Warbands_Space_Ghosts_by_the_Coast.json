    "Description": "There are an awful lot of half-teleported things wandering around the desert not too far from here. Really, any at all would be a surprising amount, but there are a bunch of them for some reason!\n\nThey don't seem particularly nice, but I bet we could learn from their predicament to ensure the Warband Bank Distance Inhibitor doesn't teleport our sweet loot into a tree!\n\nSee if you can find anything that might help us figure out what went wrong. It's not like people randomly teleport around, right?",
