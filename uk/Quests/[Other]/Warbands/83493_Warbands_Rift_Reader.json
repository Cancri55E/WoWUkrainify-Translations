We're going to make our Warband Bank accessible from anywhere!\n\nRivet's calling it a Warband Bank Distance Inhibitor until I can think of something more fun, but we need a little help to get it over the finish line.\n\nIf we're going to make sure we can access our shared stash from multiple locations, we're going to need portals! And we tracked some doozies down out here.\n\nIf you could get us some scans of the local anomalies, it'd be a big help!",
