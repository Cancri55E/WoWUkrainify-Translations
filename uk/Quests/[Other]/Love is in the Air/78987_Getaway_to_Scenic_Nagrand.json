    "Description": "Good morrow! Today's special portal is a magical getaway to the great plains of Nagrand!\n\nWould you, perchance, be interested in a proposition? I will lend you my camera if you could deliver any photographs you take to my dear friend Karn.\n\nHe has been adrift in Nagrand as of late, lost in his own thoughts. As stubborn as he is, I'm sure he will appreciate the company. I would do it myself, but I must maintain the portals here.",
