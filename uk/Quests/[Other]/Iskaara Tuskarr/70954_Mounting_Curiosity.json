    "RewardText": "While gnolls remain the primary focus of my research, I'm very curious about the recently returned dragons as well. \n\nAfter intense study and observation, I began jotting down my notes on the subject. It's nowhere near complete, but when it is, I'm sure it will be a helpful guide to you.\n\nIn the meantime, would you like to look at one of my other manuscripts? I've started to trade them for items that will help continue my studies, so if you would like to learn more, visit me again!",
