Big Kinook has been looking for you. \n\n\n\nOne time he told me to get a slimy, icky spinefish for the soup and I didn't want to, so I yelled: \"No, chef!\"\n\n\n\nHe was so mad I thought he was going to throw me in the soup!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak to Big Kinook at Iskaara in The Azure Span.",
    "RewardText": "Are you ready to make magic, adventurer? \n\nNo, I don't mean that hand wavy stuff some like to make. I mean the mystical aroma arts, the deep knowledge of ingredients and flavor, and the way a soup speaks to you to let you know what it needs. Is that you salivating? No? Must be me. \n\nLet's get cooking!",
