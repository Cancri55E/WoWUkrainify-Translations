    "Description": "Hello again! Did you know I'm gonna be the bestest fisherman in the village? I caught a giant piranha once. It tried to eat my face!\n\n\n\n<Rowie looks around distractedly.>\n\n\n\nOh yeah! I have a message for you. Nunvuq, back in Iskaara, wants to tell you about fishing holes.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak to Nunvuq at Iskaara in The Azure Span.",
    "RewardText": "Hail, fellow fisher. \n\nI'm almost hesitant to tell you of these serene fishing holes. But I must, because not doing so would deny you a bounty of fish and also the pleasure of a relaxing time fishing.\n\nIn telling everyone I worry about crowding my fishing spot, but I'll admit I can only take so much of the quiet. A good conversation with fishing friends is an even better way to relax than fishing alone!",
