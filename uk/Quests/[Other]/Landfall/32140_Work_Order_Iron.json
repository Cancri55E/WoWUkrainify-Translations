At the very least rubies!\n\nInstead, all I got was this strange iron! What am I supposed to do with this?\n\nOh well, no one said this job would be glamorous. I just do what I can to add a little class.\n\nWe just got another work order for iron. Go see Daxil down near Oregrind's Dig and get it filled pronto!",
