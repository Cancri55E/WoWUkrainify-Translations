    "Description": "Along with the crate, you get some advice on crab hunting:\n\nCrabs are strange, primordial creatures, with wildly different motivations than you or I.\n\nSmall crabs are easy to find and hunt, but the large ones hide beneath the sands, out of danger and out of our reach. To draw them out, we play on their sense of smell.\n\nThe Unga villagers to the southeast allow their fish to ferment before they eat them. Bring enough rotten fish together, and you will catch yourself a colossal crab.",
