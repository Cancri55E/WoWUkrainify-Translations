They only want the absolute waxiest ears money can buy! \n\nGuess they think they're lucky or something'.\n\nAnyways, I need you to go get 'em for me. I don't want to hurt any animals, so you'll need to get 'em from the Alliance over at Lion's Landing.\n\nHave fun - and remember, only bring me the waxiest!",
