Gold, iron... anything!\n\nInstead, we found mogu artifacts, and I get a bunch of dwarves from the Explorers' League to baby-sit.\n\nI hear from the soldiers that there's trouble in the mines. I have orders from Wrynn that I have to support the Explorers' League, but I can't spare any troops. Can you get down there and find out what's going on?",
