    "Description": "I have some idea of what Lanigosa might be doing in Crystalsong Forest, although I cannot imagine why she has taken it upon herself to do it.\n\nThat forest conceals within it the ruins of Shandaral, a former highborne settlement and the site of one of the mortal race's first clashes with the blue dragonflight. If Lanigosa truly is in Crystalsong, then it may well have something to do with Shandaral.\n\nSeek her out there, $n, and try to convince her to return to us.",
