    "RewardText": "You're just in time, dragonrider. I have a special acquisition from the Ohn'ir. \n\nWith our clans spread so far apart, we often rely on ohuna to relay critical messages. This will allow you to call upon our eagle mail carriers wherever you go. They're not the swiftest, but they are reliable.\n\nNormally I would require a trade, but this is too important a boon. You may have need of it.",
