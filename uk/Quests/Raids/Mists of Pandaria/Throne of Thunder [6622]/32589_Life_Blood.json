A secret weapon of the Thunder King no doubt.\n\nPerhaps, there is a chance we can use this discovery to our benefit. If we can re-animate it, we can study it. More importantly, we can discover its weakness.\n\nGo to the Throne of Thunder and use this crystal to capture whatever essence animates these constructs.\n\nReturn to me when the task is complete.",
