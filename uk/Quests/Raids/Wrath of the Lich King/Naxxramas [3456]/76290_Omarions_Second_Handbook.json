I want you to know that my dying thoughts revolved around you and your ineptitude in tradeskills.\n\nAbout the book: These are the rest of my recipes. Please share them with someone more capable. Alas, I am sure you will keep them for yourself and charge a hefty fee for your services because you are, after all, a bastard.\n\nIn Disdain,\nOmarion",
