    "Description": "It seems that the fabric of the Emerald Dream itself is rejecting the invaders, leaving behind shadows of their dreams in the form of these Essences. So close to Amirdrassil, even your own actions are leaving behind ephemeral echoes of power. \n\nWith enough time, perhaps we can use these echoes to awaken their strength and turn it against Fyrakk himself. Defeat the invaders wherever you find them and return to me when you have gathered enough of the Dream's power.",
