    "Title": "Arcane Intrusion",
    "Description": "That beacon ahead--I am certain it was not there before we were imprisoned.\n\nSpellcraft is not my forte, but I know arcane magic when I see it. The same magic used by the blue dragon in the creche.\n\nHe said a name... Malygos. It sounds so familiar, but the Earth-Warder's teachings feel distant. Fragmented.\n\nIf this Malygos put us into stasis, perhaps the arcane beacon was placed on his orders.\n\nInvestigate the area and report back. Ensure the beacon cannot be used to call in enemy reinforcements.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Investigate the beacon.",
    "RewardText": "<Azurathel listens intently as you tell him what you witnessed.>\n\nSo there were beacons placed outside the other creches as well.\n\nOur allies are in peril. We must reach them!",
