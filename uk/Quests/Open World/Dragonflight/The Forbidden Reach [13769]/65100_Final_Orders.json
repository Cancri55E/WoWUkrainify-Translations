For the first time, we are free to make our own choices. To find our own fate.\n\nWherever you go in this new age, I hope you find worthy allies. Tell them our story.\n\nAs for me, I will stay here and look for survivors. Along the way, I may find answers about our past.\n\nMay fortune favor us all, $p.",
