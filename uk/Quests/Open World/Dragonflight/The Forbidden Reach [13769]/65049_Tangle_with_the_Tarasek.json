    "Description": "The tarasek are unpredictable and wild. Like primordial drakonid, if you will.\n\nNeltharion considered them little more than fodder. Targets for our training. But they are cunning hunters, and deadly when encountered in packs.\n\nShould they gain elemental power from these Primalists, they will become even more dangerous.\n\nWe cannot let that happen, $n. Thin their numbers.",
