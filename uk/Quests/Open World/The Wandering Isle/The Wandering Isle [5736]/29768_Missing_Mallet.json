    "Description": "$n, I've got it! It's simple really. Let's make a ruckus so loud that there's no way he can sleep through it.\n\nWhy look at that, a conveniently placed gong! Makes me think this may just be how they've awoken him in the past. We just need the matching mallet to get it ringing as loud as possible.\n\nThe village leader tells me the mallet is over at the Ki-Han Brewery on the river, to the southwest. It's not far. Mind picking it up for me while I give the village some fair warning?",
