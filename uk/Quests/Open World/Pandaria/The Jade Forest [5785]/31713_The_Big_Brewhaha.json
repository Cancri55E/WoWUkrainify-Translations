    "Description": "It's a disaster, $n!\n\nWhen I went to visit the Dancing Serpent Inn yesterday, they were all out of brew. They said the shipment from Sri-La Village had been stolen. STOLEN!\n\nTurns out those Oona hozen have been making all kinds of trouble down at the docks, including taking all the brew to their cave at Oona Kagu along the coast.\n\nI can't handle a dry spell. A life without brew is not a life worth living!\n\nSomeone needs to go and save the brew!",
