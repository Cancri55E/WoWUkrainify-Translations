I told him not to go back, that it was too dangerous, but he's as stubborn as a hozen and twice as stupid. Says the boys need him around for \"moral support.\"\n\n<Mann sneers.>\n\nWhat about my moral support?! What am I gonna do if that idiot dies?!\n\nPlease... keep an eye out for him. Tell him to come home.\n\n<Her eyes soften before she turns away.>",
