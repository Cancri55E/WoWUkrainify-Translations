    "Description": "Our whole jade supply line has fallen apart. The mines are a death trap, morale is historically low, and - as if that weren't bad enough - the mason's quarter has been overrun by wood sprites!\n\nNow even the plants are out to ruin me!\n\nYou need jade so badly, you can follow the road southwest to the mason's quarter and get it from those glorified chopsticks yourself.",

    "RewardText": "Catch? They were playin' CATCH with my product?!\n\nI hope you showed those walkin' toothpicks a thing or two.\n\nYou know, maybe you ain't a $gcub:tart; after all. I've been lookin' for some muscle to help out with my problem at the quarry.\n\nAnd judgin' by the size of the Lorewalker's restoration project here, I think you'll need a lot more jade.",
