    "Description": "So many spirits held in captivity here... I can feel them everywhere. Even the walls are a cage for the long-dead.\n\n$n, we cannot simply break the sorcery over this place - doing so would release countless agonized souls to wander the earth. They will need a beacon, something to guide them.\n\nWith your help, I can create a tan-chao: a bridge from this world to the heavens. For this ritual, I'll need a bowl, a candle, and a jade cong. You should be able to find them all within the ruins.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Bring Pei-Zhi a Chipped Ritual Bowl, a Pungent Ritual Candle, and a Jade Cong from the Terrace of Ten Thunders.",
    "CompletionText": "Have you found the items we need for the ritual? We cannot guide these spirits back without them.",
    "RewardText": "Good work. With these, I can complete the ritual to send all of the spirits here--including myself--back where they belong.",
