    "Description": "Kor'ik has been sending signals to the empress for weeks. Everything the Klaxxi have done, the empress knows about.\n\nThat stops now!\n\nKypari Ik will be the first to receive news of Kor'ik's demise. It would benefit us to make sure that message does not make it to the empress.\n\nDestroying the whisperers and beacon there will buy us enough time to come up with a plan before the empress can act.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Destroy 5 Ik'thik Whisperers and deactivate the Kypari Ik Beacon.",
    "CompletionText": "Information is power, Wakener. Those with the most information always have the most power.",
    "RewardText": "Excellent work! This should allow us the time to repair the damage Kor'ik caused.\n\nYou may have just shifted the tide of war in our favor.",
