    "Description": "We've found the blades, bound them together with wood and shade, and blessed them with an ancient incantation. If I'm not mistaken, it's time to use this thing.\n\nThe sprites spoke of an ancient piece of sap within the Amber Hibernal, a mantid cave near their empress' palace. That must be the \"Blood of Ancients\" that the prophecy spoke of.\n\nWhatever's inside that sap must be important. Good luck, $n.",

    "CompletionText": "Make sure to bring that forked blade with you.",
    "RewardText": "There was a... a mantid inside that amber? I never would have thought that the solution to our war on the mantid would be... another mantid.\n\nThere are still many things that I have left to learn, but I do know this: that CERTAINLY wasn't a beer recipe.",
