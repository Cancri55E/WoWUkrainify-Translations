There is an enormous amber deposit sitting at the bottom of the Lake of Stars.\n\nUnfortunately, a hostile saurok tribe lives at the edge of the lake, and revere the amber as their own.\n\nThey will not allow us to enter their territory easily.\n\nGo south to the lake. Kill the Mistblade saurok, so that we can more easily harvest the nearby amber.",
