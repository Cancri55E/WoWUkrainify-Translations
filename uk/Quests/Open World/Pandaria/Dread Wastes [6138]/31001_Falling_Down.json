    "Description": "It's bad enough trying to hold off the mantid, but now we've got spiders swarming up from the ruins below.\n\nOne of my best marksmen caught a blast of webbing around his leg and got pulled straight down!\n\nWe think he's alive, but I don't have the manpower to send anyone in after him. We're stretched thin up here, $c.\n\nIf you want to help, use the rope behind me to drop down into the ruins. You're not afraid of heights are you?\n\nHow about spiders?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Use the Shado-Pan Rope to descend into the Terrace of Gurthan and search for the fallen Shado-Pan marksman.",
    "RewardText": "The fall wasn't that bad, actually. I've always had a knack for soft landings.\n\nThat I landed on a pile of spider corpses probably helped, too.",
