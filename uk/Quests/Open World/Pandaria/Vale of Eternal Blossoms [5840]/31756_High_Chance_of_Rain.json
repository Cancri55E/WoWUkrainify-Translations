    "Description": "The mogu are conjuring some kind of sinister storm upon the Golden Stair. Generally, mogu and lightning are not a particularly pleasant mix. I say we stop them.\n\nYou should be able to find their Stormcaller staves pretty easily, considering the giant arcs of lightning extending up from them. Mind knocking them over or destroying them or something for me? I sure would sleep better.",
