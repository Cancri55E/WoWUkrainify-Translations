    "Description": "Vicejaw! Sounds absolutely violent, does it not? I came up with it myself, and I think it's very suiting. I tried to wrestle my staff away from him for hours, but he simply would not let go!\n\nOkay, it was really more like a few seconds. I like to be truthful to my friends, even if it makes my stories significantly more boring.\n\nAnyway, would you be so kind as to release your oh-so-potent wrath upon this crocolisk with a vice-like jaw, and then kindly bring my staff back? Preferably in-tact!",
