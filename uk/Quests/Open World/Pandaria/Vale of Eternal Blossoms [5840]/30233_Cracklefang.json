    "Description": "Hi! So, I have a dilemma. I've only got one good wolf name.... wait for it... Cracklefang! I know, amazing right?! But now there are TWO big nasty wolves in the forest, which is all kinds of confusing.\n\nI need you to kill one of them so I can free up the name. Should be simple enough, yeah? Especially for someone of your incredibleness.\n\nSo, are you on board? I'm hoping for yes!",
