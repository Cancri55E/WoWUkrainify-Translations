    "Description": "What is there to say, stranger?\n\nI fought Jung Duk and lost. I was the fool to believe he would fight fairly.\n\nNow, my own brothers turned against me, and here I am, speaking to our enemies.\n\nI know you have come for Osul blood.\n\nI only ask that you hunt down the three who betrayed me.\n\nUrang, who poisoned my drink. Ku-Tong, who bent my spear. And Battat, whose dagger slipped into my side as my victory was assured.\n\nDo this, and I can die in peace.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Kill Urang, Ku-Tong, and Battat.",
    "CompletionText": "How could they have betrayed me? They were once my brothers!\n\nWhy did they turn on me? WHY?\n\nI hate them! I will slaughter them all!",
    "RewardText": "It pleases me to know those cowards died at your hands.\n\nPerhaps now, this burning tide in my heart will ebb.",
