    "Description": "We've heard reports of a group of Mogu infiltrating the coast here in Townlong. I have no idea what they are doing. Frankly, I don't care. \n\nYou've proven yourself, so we've decided to give this mission to you.\n\nWhat's going to happen is this - you're going to go, find them, and kill them.\n\nOur scouts reported the first group landed to the north, between here and Deadtalker's Plateau. Go there and wipe them out.",
