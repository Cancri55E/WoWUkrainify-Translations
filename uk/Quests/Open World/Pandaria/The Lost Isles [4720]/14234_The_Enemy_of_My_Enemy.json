    "Description": "I hate to ask you to do this, but I guess it's why they pay you the big bucks. Can you deliver that dead orc's field journal to whoever is in charge up at their camp?\n\nBased on the writing in the book, they should be located at the top of the island, up the incline past the Kaja'mite cavern to the southeast.\n\nGood luck, $n. I always liked you.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Deliver the Field Journal to Aggra at the Horde Base Camp on the Lost Isles.",
    "CompletionText": "<The orc narrows her eyes at you.>\n\nYou must have been on the goblin slave ship that was sunk. What's that you have in your hand?",
    "RewardText": "<The orc makes a move to grab the field journal from you, but then stops herself, exhaling deeply.>\n\nI apologize. It has been a very rough couple of days for all of us.\n\nI am Aggra. All of us here are what remains of the crew of the Draka's Fury.\n\nPerhaps we can work together. We have a common enemy in the Alliance. Their SI:7 assassins are all over this island and they're not going to stop until we're all dead.",
