    "Description": "Smart mining monkeys!\n\nThey're all over the inside of the cavern, mining... with picks! It's just not natural and I'm sure it's because of the kaja'mite!\n\nNone of my miners have come back out. I don't have many left! You can see my predicament, $n.\n\n<The foreman lowers his voice.>\n\nThese guys are nowhere near as good as my old group of jungle trolls. Ah, those were the days.\n\nMaybe you can escort my last miner here through the cavern and keep those monkeys off of him? We need that kaja'mite!",

    "CompletionText": "How did it go? How much kaja'mite were you able to get?",
    "RewardText": "We've hit the mother lode!!!\n\nNow, what's all this about a pygmy witchdoctor in charge of the monkeys? Is he dead? Because if he's dead, then legally I can stake my claim... not that I wasn't going to do that anyway. By goblin law, all kaja'mite belongs to us!",
