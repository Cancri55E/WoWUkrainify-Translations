    "Description": "Volcanoth is the turtle god in the cave that these primitives worship.\n\nIt's not really a god.\n\n<Hobart rolls his eyes.>\n\nBut it is tough enough that I'm going to have to devise a new weapon for you from the one functioning boot we have left.\n\nI think that the age-old motto of \"fight fire with fire\" applies here. Plus, I like fire!\n\nLet's get some fire glands from Volcanoth's children. That should give me time to modify the rocket boot into something more fitting.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 5 Fire Glands.",
    "CompletionText": "No time like the present to be done with the simple task I put before you, $n. Wouldn't you agree?",
    "RewardText": "Careful with those glands, $n, careful!\n\n<Grapplehammer's eyes light up at the sight of the fiery organs.>\n\nAnd now to load them into the refashioned shredder boot. I'm certain that you'll be surprised and amazed by my genius invention.",
