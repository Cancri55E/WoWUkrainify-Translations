    "Description": "The pygmies took most of our people back to their village. Who knows what evil they're up to?\n\n$n, you have to go up there and free all of the captives before the pygmies work their voodoo on them!\n\nIzzy's already up near Oomlot Village to the southeast. She'll give you the heads-up on what's going down.\n\nYour pygmy helmet looks like it's in bad shape, but it should last long enough for you to get there.\n\nI hope.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak with Izzy at Oomlot Village on the Lost Isles.",
    "RewardText": "$n? What are you doing wearing that pygmy helm? Looks like it's about to fall apart.\n\nI'm glad that they sent you up here. I thought for sure they were going to send that jerk, Grapplehammer and his ego-enabling assistant.",
