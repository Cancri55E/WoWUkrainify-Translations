    "Description": "Ever since this storm began, I've just been... tired.\n\nNot physically... no. It's like my very soul is exhausted. Worthless. Hopeless. I imagine it's what one feels when a mate leaves them for someone with a rounder belly, but I've never had a mate so how would I know?\n\nHow can I claim to know anything? I'm worthless to everyone but these thunderbirds. At least they'll have a good meal out of me.\n\n<Yi-Mo sighs deeply and continues staring off into the sky. It doesn't look like he's going anywhere.>",
