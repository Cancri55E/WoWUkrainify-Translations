    "Description": "We assault the mogu at the Court of Bones, but I fear we merely send them fodder for their abominable rituals.\n\nThe mogu do not merely kill their prisoners - they steal their souls and imbue them in machinations of stone, or reforge the fallen into ghostly tools of war.\n\nAlliance or Horde, it matters not. We cannot allow the mogu to bolster their numbers.\n\nGo into the crypts. Free any prisoners that are still living.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Save 6 Silver Covenant Scouts or Sunreaver Scouts.",
    "CompletionText": "The mogu will steal the very souls from the living. I will not allow this atrocity to continue!",
    "RewardText": "Thank you, $n. You have lightened my heart of a heavy burden through your heroic actions.\n\nI will remember your efforts on this day.",
