He's just throwing barrels everywhere!\n\nBarrels, man!\n\nIt looks like he managed to get pretty much all the pandaren that were working out in front of the brewery. If I were you, I'd help some of them break out. Put some of those ridiculous muscles to use.\n\nWe're headed over to the brewery's rear entrance, to the east. Meet you there!",
