I'd send Shado-Pan to aid them, but I haven't got any left.\n\nThere's dangerous creatures up there near the wall. If you find those students, make sure that they haven't fallen to any of them.",

    "RewardText": "They can't keep fighting like this forever. Those kids are downright heroic, but I don't want them to die as heroes.\n\nIt's time to throw in the towel.",
