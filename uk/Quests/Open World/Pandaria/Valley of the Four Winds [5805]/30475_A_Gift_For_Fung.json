    "Description": "Farmer Fung is pretty mean, and just a little scary. Mah always said that he was one of the best farmers in the valley, though.\n\nI think I know the perfect gift for a mean, kind of scary guy like him.\n\nThere's some big plainshawks that circle the hills to the west of here. You should get one, find a big piece of meat, and then ask Kol Ironpaw to grill it up!",
