    "Title": "Lost Lord of the Storm",
    "Description": "Listen well, stranger. Once a year, the great ram Durzan, Lord of the Southern Storm, crosses the isle to meet his brother Belzt on Thunderhead Peak. The clash of their horns heralds the storm and brings prosperity for another year.\n\nBut something is wrong. Durzan has not come and the skies have cleared. The Stormrider may not believe, but I sense you have seen wilder things.\n\nAsk around if you still have doubts. Just please help us find Durzan.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Find Durzan near Rambleshire.",
    "CompletionText": "Pray Durzan is still with us. If the brothers don't meet at the summit, the storm and our livelihoods will be lost.",
    "RewardText": "You found him! But why hasn't he gone to the mountain? And why does he look so forlorn?",
