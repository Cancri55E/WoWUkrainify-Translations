    "Description": "So you are an inscriber? I know one of the best inscribers in Dornogal.\n\nYou should look for Brrigan on the southern edge of the Forgegrounds. \n\nBrrigan owns a drafting table where you can review, craft, and deliver work orders from public lists and personal contacts like friends and guildmates. If you are lucky, you might come across an order from a renowned person that offers some extra rewards--or so I hear.",
