    "Description": "Brinthe has been a wonderful resource for helping to reconnect the Arathi and the earthen. She's told me everything that happened recently with her people in the Ringing Deeps. \n\nI can... relate to feeling frustrated with the direction your people are taking. Fortunately, Steelstrike is a more reasonable leader than this... High Speaker Eirich. \n\nEirich fled to the Stonevault to gather his forces. I know it would mean a lot to Brinthe and her people if you went after him and stopped his plans!",
