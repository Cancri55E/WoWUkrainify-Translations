    "Description": "So you are a jewelcrafter? You should have mentioned that earlier!\n\nLet me send you to Makir, a jewelcrafter of great renown, who has a shop on the southern part of the Forgegrounds. I will mark it on your map. \n\nMakir has his very own jeweler's bench where you can review, craft, and deliver work orders from public lists and personal contacts like friends and guildmates. If you are lucky, you might come across an order from a renowned person that offers some extra rewards--or so I hear.",
