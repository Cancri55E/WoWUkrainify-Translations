He runs the Cinderbrew Meadery.\n\nHe says that goblins affiliated with an organization calling itself Venture Co. are trying to take over the meadery. We cannot have that. I need you to get into the meadery and remove that threat.\n\nCinderbrew is an earthen product and should be under earthen control. Wenbrandt will teach them this lesson--but until then, I will count on you to finish the job.",
