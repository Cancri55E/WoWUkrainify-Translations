    "Description": "Magical staff? Wards? What were you doing, Freydrin?\n\n<Igris ruminates briefly, her brow crinkling and eyes aglow. After a moment, she turns to you with a smile carved into her face.>\n\nI've got it! \n\nThe life energy in this staff should overcome any mycotic corruptions in the wildlife here. Then you return them to the natural cycle and the land will heal on its own in time.\n\nAnd if you see any wards, take them down. Take her memory gem just in case. It may yield more information yet.",
