    "Title": "A Place Forgotten",
    "Description": "There is... a place behind Dornogal that I cannot go.\n\nAnd I am not the only one. Something--a force, most likely titan in origin--keeps the earthen from investigating a small portion of the island behind the city.\n\nThis, of course, fires my curiosity. But for thousands of years I have dutifully kept away. It seemed the titans' will.\n\nThe site emits a faint signal like the one from this device. Perhaps it is \"the key\" in a literal sense to what lies there.\n\nWe will see.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Meet with Speaker Brinthe and Dagran behind Dornogal in the Isle of Dorn.",
    "RewardText": "I cannot describe what this place feels like to me.\n\nIt is... oppressive. I cannot think.\n\nThe urge to turn back is... strong.",
