    "Title": "Charging Up That Hill",
    "Description": "Before we use the conduit to summon the stormrooks, we need to recharge it. There are other, gentler ways to do this but... we have to work with what's on hand. \n\nThe way to the peak is overrun with hostile elementals cast off from the storm. If we send them back to their plane, we can capture their residual energy and re-energize the conduit.\n\nWhile you work on recharging the conduit, we will go ahead and prepare for the ritual at the peak.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Charge the conduit with elemental energy.",
    "CompletionText": "Have you finished charging the conduit?",
    "RewardText": "The conduit! Do you feel that? It's humming--no, it's practically singing with power. \n\nI've heard this song before, late at night in the Stormperch's rookery. When the storms would come and lightning flashed across the bay, the rooks would answer just like this. \n\nYou can't hear it?",
