    "Description": "I do not yet know why you have come here, outlander. But you seem... efficient in killing nerubians.\n\nAs are we, the Stormriders, vanguards of this isle.\n\nThe nerubians are an ancient enemy. I would not be surprised if this Zirix knows and fears me, the Stormward.\n\nEven so, we could use your skill to help us protect Dornogal.\n\nI have a stormrook for you to ride. Mount up and help us rid our city of these insects!",

    "RewardText": "I do not know why the nerubians have returned...\n\nOr why they would attack Dornogal.\n\nFor now I must focus on assessing the damage to the Coreway.\n\nOur brethren the Machine Speakers may need our aid, and it is the titans' will that the way to the center of Azeroth be kept open.",
