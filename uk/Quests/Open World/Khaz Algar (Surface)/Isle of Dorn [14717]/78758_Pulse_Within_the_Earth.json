    "Description": "Before we go and wake up a slumbering mountain giant, it's probably best we get an idea for how deeply asleep he is. \n\nThough, if the nerubians burrowing up didn't wake him up, I'm not sure what will.\n\nTake these earth shards and plant them on the waterfalls and hills around the lake. \n\nOnce we've got them set up, I'll be able to get a reading on the giant's health.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Place 4 Tremor Stones around the pond.",
    "CompletionText": "Once you've got the shards set up, I can drop the final one here to get a proper read.",
    "RewardText": "The mountain giant's got a weak heartbeat.\n\nPoor lad's likely been disturbed from a deep slumber with all of these elementals breaking off from the falls.\n\nFortunately, the pair of us are experts in healing elemental and elemental-adjacent's life forms, aren't we? \n\nIf the salve can work on earthen and rock rams, it can work on mountain giants!",
