    "Description": "We know the nerubians are in league with Xal'atath. An' we have a fair idea why they attacked us--and Dalaran.\n\nThey seem bent on destroying the earthen--even kickin' 'em when they're down.\n\nBut why? Is it because the Coreway is the key an' destroyin' it was nae enough? Maybe what we're doin' here, repairin' the Coreway, is just what they dunnae want us to do.\n\nWe should go back to Dornogal an try to piece this together.",

    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Return to Moira Thaurissan in Dornogal.",
    "RewardText": "The earthen Council is reunited. Hopefully they can put the past aside an' get the Coreway repaired.\n\nThen hopefully they'll help us with the nerubians--an' Xal'atath.",
