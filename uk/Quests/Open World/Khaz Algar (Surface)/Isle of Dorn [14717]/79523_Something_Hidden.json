    "Description": "So, they have built extra compartments in the crates to hide extra items, eh? That explains how they have been smuggling goods into and out of Dornogal without our auditors knowing.\n\nExcellent work, $n! But now the fun part of our job: those crates will have to be broken open and the smuggled goods taken into evidence.\n\nSmash the bottoms out of the crates and bring anything you find back to me.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Smash 3 False-Bottomed Crates and gather any hidden evidence you find inside.",
    "CompletionText": "Better luck this time, I hope?",
    "RewardText": "<Kragad frowns as he looks over the goods you found.>\n\nSome of these goods are from Azj-Kahet... We are specifically forbidden from trading with the nerubians in any capacity. We cannot risk any resources falling into the hands of our enemies.\n\nThe Councilward must be informed.",
