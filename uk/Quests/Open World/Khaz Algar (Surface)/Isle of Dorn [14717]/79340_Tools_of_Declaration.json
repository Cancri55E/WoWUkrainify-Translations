    "Description": "As Unbound caretakers, we have a tradition for when a master bequeaths their mantle to their apprentice. \n\nFiguratively, of course.\n\nTo do that, Korgran will need a horn.\n\nHe would then face me, blow the horn, and the sound signifies his passing the mantle of the Mourning Rise caretaker to me.\n\nI saw shalehorns to the west of here. I would be thankful if you could bring me several of their horns. I will choose one that is suitable.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 4 Pristine Horns near Restless Estuary.",
    "CompletionText": "Remember, the horns must be in pristine condition.",
    "RewardText": "These are beautiful!\n\nI feel sorry for the shalehorns, but there are many of them around.",
