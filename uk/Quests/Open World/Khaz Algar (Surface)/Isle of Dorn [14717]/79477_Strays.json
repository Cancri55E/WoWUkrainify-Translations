    "Description": "Kurdran Wildhammer has come to train the new Stormriders in aerial maneuvers. Thrall says his clan rides gryphons--much like the Stormriders ride stormrooks--so he should be of great help to us.\n\nUnfortunately, a few of our new recruits seem to have, uh, wandered off with their stormrooks. I wanted them to have a chance to bond, but it's time to come home.\n\nWould you mind rounding them up? Thrall and I are putting together something special for these \"rookies\" lessons.",

    "CompletionText": "You found those stray rookies yet?",
    "RewardText": "Right then! Good on ye for roundin' everyone up. We're lookin' tae start formal flight trainin' and we wouldn't want any stragglers, now would we? \n\nI'm eager to see what these stormrooks--and the earthen--can do.",
