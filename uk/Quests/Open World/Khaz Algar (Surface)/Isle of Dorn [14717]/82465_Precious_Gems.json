    "Description": "So, all they gave us was a location and a garbled riddle...\n\nBut I guess we know where to start.\n\nI can picture it now. Once I have Basalteous's  knowledge, I will have nobles and merchants lining up outside my house. No, my mansion! \n\nThe earthen did say southwest, right? I will find the cave and meet you there. Quickly now!",
