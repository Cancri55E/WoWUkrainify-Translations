Distant shouts and screams echo in your ringing ears.\n\nThe last thing you remember is Dalaran, the great, floating city of magic, plummeting to the earth--then nothing but darkness.\n\nMixed in with sounds of shouting and battle, you hear a strange, insectoid chittering.\n\nThe nerubians were waiting for you.\n\nYou must rejoin the fight, but first you need to free yourself from the crushing weight of the rubble piled atop you.>",
