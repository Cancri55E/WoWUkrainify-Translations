    "Description": "It seems the gorlocs have been bolstering their forces with summoned elementals. That explains how they were able to overrun the farmers so easily.\n\nIt will take all of our strength to hold off the colossi already in the field. I need you to stop any new elementals from being created.\n\nElementals of this size and power can only be created by the most powerful of gorloc shaman. Seek them out behind enemy lines and eliminate them.\n\nThis should end the gorloc threat to the farmers once and for all.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Defeat the three gorloc shaman leaders.",
    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Meet Dorbund at the Glimmering Shore.",
    "RewardText": "Thank you for your aid stranger. Without you, none of this would have been possible. You have given us back our livelihood today, and our hope.\n\nTake this as a small token of our gratitude. It is not enough, but it is all we can offer. Know that you will always be welcome among our people.\n\nLet us now turn our attention to Aggartha.",
