    "Description": "Desecrating a memorial site is one of our greatest taboos in earthen society. This site is a window to our past, into our memories, and a place of self-reflection where we can commune with those who are no longer here.\n\nStill, so many of these kobolds infest Mourning Rise. For their crimes, the kobolds deserve the harshest punishment. They must be culled even further.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Slay kobold invaders in Mourning Rise.",
    "CompletionText": "So many of them still infest Mourning Rise.",
    "RewardText": "I was not made as an earthen of the sword, nor as one who calls for violence. That is the domain of the Stormriders. \n\nWhat these kobolds did is frowned upon not just by us, the Unbound, but by everyone in earthen society. I am not proud that we had to kill them, but we had to stop them by any means.",
