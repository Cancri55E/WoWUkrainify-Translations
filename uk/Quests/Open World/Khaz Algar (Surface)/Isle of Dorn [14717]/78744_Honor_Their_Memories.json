    "Title": "Honor Their Memories",
    "Description": "Take these gifts and place them by the past caretakers. Each is a gift honoring their memory.\n\nI'd also like us to perform some light groundskeeping to at least maintain the site. Unfortunately, what these kobolds are doing to the memorials will take us weeks to fix.\n\nPlease do what you can about the kobolds. It would be unwise to leave the gifts unguarded while they are still roaming the area.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Eliminate the kobold infestation and place gifts near the shut-down, past caretakers.",
    "CompletionText": "The kobolds cannot be left to desecrate Mourning Rise.\n\nThe Unbound that rest here are here because they do not want to be disturbed or moved. While they do not wish to be revived, taking their armor and possessions is an insult to earthen culture.\n\nWe must do something.",
    "RewardText": "I am amazed how much damage the kobolds have done to the site. So many shut-down earthen desecrated!\n\nI know that I am not yet the head caretaker, but I take full responsibility for this. I should have asked for the mantle of caretaker long ago when Korgran started to show the first signs of memory overwrite and stasis lock.",
