    "Description": "There is one final thing I must ask of you.\n\nThere is a great monster that roams these woods. I am certain you've sensed it. It must be felled.\n\nRotbark was Freydrin's final means to control this basin, but even this was too great for any individual earthen. Ours is not to control, but to tend to its needs.\n\nUse the staff once more and bring an end to Rotbark's reign.",
