My people are dying as we speak. Some were abducted by the nerubians during the attack.\n\nYou're not the first outlander I've met. A small fellow, like Moira, arrived here earlier and wasted no time following the nerubians. He took the path west to a nearby cave.\n\nI would be in your debt if you found my people.",
