    "Description": "Before I shut down, I must craft an item that is meaningful to me. \n\nAs a Stonebound, I worked the mines. I had a lantern I made and used until I lost it in a collapse. I became Unbound shortly after.\n\nI wish to forge a new lantern to guide my way through these final moments.\n\nThe lantern was made of an ore found in small amounts around this area. I used a charged core in the lantern. You can find them in the stormfangs that roam these hills.\n\nGather the materials, and I will forge the lantern.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Gather 5 ore and 5 Charged cores near Fallside Outpost.",
    "CompletionText": "Have you gotten the materials I asked for?",
    "RewardText": "These will do nicely!\n\nNow... hopefully I can remember how to forge a lantern.",
