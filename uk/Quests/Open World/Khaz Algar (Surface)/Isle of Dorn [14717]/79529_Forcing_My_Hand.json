    "Description": "I do not know if Ardgrin merely intended to sabotage me or if he wanted to force a confrontation. Either way, a confrontation he will have.\n\nI believe this situation can be rectified peacefully, but I cannot do it as the Councilward. Steelvein has never appeared in the stone, but he must now. I will parlay with Ardgrin in the Deeps and this situation will be concluded.\n\nI would have you accompany me, but there are some things I want you to know before that. Help me prepare and I will speak with you.",
