    "Description": "I'm certain there are still Order folks sneaking around here. Now they might be carrying messages on them, just like the clues you found in Freywold. \n\nYou and I are gonna find out.\n\nHere, take these thuribles. They might look like tiny incense burners, but I've enchanted them with Sacred Flame. \n\nJust throw one down and you'll get a big bang with a bright flash! Should be enough to stun anyone sneaking around. \n\nJust don't throw one at me! Got it?",

    "CompletionText": "Alright, I'll admit it, the little Pebble is pretty useful. He knows more about the earthen and the surface than I ever will. \n\nAnyway, did you find anything?",
    "RewardText": "\"New friends\" huh?\n\nGuess I'm not the only one...\n\n<Kaerter freezes when he realizes what he's just said and suddenly points a finger at you.>\n\nYou didn't hear me say nothing, got it?",
