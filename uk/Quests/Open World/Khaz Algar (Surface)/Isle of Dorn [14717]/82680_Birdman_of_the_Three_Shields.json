    "Description": "Are you here to watch the mosswools? No?\n\nThat's too bad. I find the elemental creatures on our isle fascinating. I'm not the only one. \n\nAn old friend of mine named Olbarig resides out on the Three Shields. He studies the wild cloudrooks there.\n\nBut come to think of it, I haven't heard from him in awhile. Maybe someone should check on him. Hm. Would you mind?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Find Olbarig on the Three Shields.",
    "RewardText": "Harmot sent you to check on me? \n\nHuh. Well, I didn't know that sack of charcoal cared.\n\nBut he does have an innate sense of when elementals are in turmoil. Maybe he knew something was brewing out here.\n\nHarmot's timing is good, outlander. And your aid would be most welcome.",
