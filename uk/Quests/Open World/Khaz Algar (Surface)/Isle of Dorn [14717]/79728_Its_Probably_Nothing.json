I haven't seen one since we were in Zaralek Cavern!\n\n$n, you should see if we can get it to work. I will stand back here, just in case it is, um, not friendly. \n\nNothing to worry about, I'm sure.",

I don't want to be here if its friends come back with it.\n\nThat's not a reunion party I want to be a part of.\n\nHopefully it won't hone in on Tharessa... Nah, probably not. Anyway, we should get going. Like now.\n\nCatch you later, $n. Thanks for your... um, help? I guess?",
