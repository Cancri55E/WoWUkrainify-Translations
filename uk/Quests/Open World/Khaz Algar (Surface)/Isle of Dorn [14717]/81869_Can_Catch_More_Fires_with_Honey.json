    "Description": "Crafting with flame demands a fuel that burns pure and has sustainable power. Among these, the honey created by Cinderwold bees stands out! A source of elemental fire, organic and untainted.\n\nI've longed for a supply of this honey, yet never had the chance to procure it. \n\nTake my harvesting device and gather a quantity for our purpose. We shall infuse it into your tinderbox. Exercise caution, for some of the Earthen revere these bees as sacred creatures.",
