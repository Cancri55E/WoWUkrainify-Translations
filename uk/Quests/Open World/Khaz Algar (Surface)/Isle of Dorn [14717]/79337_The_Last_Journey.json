    "Description": "This lantern is perfect.\n\nEnough of this. It is time! I can feel my memory clouding. We have to get going. Urtago is waiting for us. They will join us on my final journey to Mourning Rise, where we will conduct a ceremony.\n\n<Korgran forces a smile.>\n\nIt is nothing fancy, I promise. As I said, it is more symbolic than anything else.\n\nMy head feels heavy. What was I doing again? Hmm, oh, right! Meeting Urtago!",

    "RewardText": "$n, we have to find Korgran! If he keeps on exerting himself, he will shutdown in the middle of nowhere.\n\nAnd it's not safe for him to be out in his condition. He would be easy prey for stormfangs and even kobolds.",
