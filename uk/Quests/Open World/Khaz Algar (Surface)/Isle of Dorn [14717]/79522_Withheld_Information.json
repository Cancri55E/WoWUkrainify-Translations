We have no reason to believe we were being misled.\n\nThe Councilward will want us to get to the bottom of this, and I refuse to disappoint him.\n\nWe haven't been able to get any additional information out of the workers, but maybe you'll have more luck. \n\nSpeak to the ones we have detained here, and see if you can learn anything.",
