    "Description": "If we're to solve this quarrel between Steelvein and Ardgrin amicably, then we'll need to make some new friends.\n\nOne of Ardgrin's employees, Obstorn, frequents a cinderbrew speakeasy here in Dornogal. Only Machine Speakers may enter it.\n\nEven as Councilward, I am not able to access it. However, there are others in the city who can.\n\nBevrusi, a Gundargaz trader, should be able to give you access. If you can grease her palm, she may be able to supply you access.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Convince Bevrusi to give you access to the cinderbrew speakeasy.",
    "CompletionText": "Do I know you?",
    "RewardText": "So what do you say, surface-runner? \n\nYou polish my back and I'll polish yours. Do we have a deal?",
