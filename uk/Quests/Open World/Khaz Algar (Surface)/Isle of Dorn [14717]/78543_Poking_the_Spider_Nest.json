    "Description": "The meadery is evacuated and the explosives are primed. It is time to bait the nerubians into our trap.\n\nYour compatriot is by the nerubian burrow north of here. She told me her directive is to keep watch over it in case the nerubians make a move before we are ready.\n\nSo far they have not made a move and may now need... coaxing. Take a keg of cinderbrew to the burrow. Tossing it in should stir their \"nest.\"\n\nRendezvous with us back at the Meadyard--quickly--after.",
