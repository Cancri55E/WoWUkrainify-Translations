    "Description": "By the Coreway, this stuff packs a punch!\n\nCombining healing silt with the molten fusion properties of fire honey has given us a salve that could wake a whole mountain!\n\nWhich is exactly what you'll do. Take the mixture over to our wounded friend in Farnee's pond, and slap it on his hide!\n\nIt should be enough to wake him up and alleviate any soreness.\n\nHopefully, any ways.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Apply elemental salve to the mountain giant for Harmot.",
    "CompletionText": "This will either wake the giant and patch him up good as new or...\n\nWell, let's not talk about the other possibility. Have some faith in the process!",
    "RewardText": "Well, would you look at that! \n\nThousands of years slumbering at the base of a waterfall and he wakes up without even a roar or a foot-stomp.\n\nHah! And Farnee was worried!\n\nYou did great with making that salve, $n. Both Farnee and I owe you a big thanks. \n\nOur new friend looks thankful too!",
