    "Description": "The nerubians will strike out in anger and pride--which is exactly what we want.\n\nThey will swarm the meadery soon, seeking to punish us for attacking their burrow. We will hold them here on the ground while you take to the skies. When Zirix appears to command his army, we will light the fuses.\n\nWenbrandt scrounged together some supplies we can use to corral the nerubians. Set them up quickly, and then we will get you on a stormrook. Go!",
