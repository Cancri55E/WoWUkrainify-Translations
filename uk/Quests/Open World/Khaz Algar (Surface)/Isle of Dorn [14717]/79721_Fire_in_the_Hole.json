I'm Wenbrandt, tamer of cinderbees and creator of cinderbrew.\n\n<Wenbrandt squares himself up as if you should be impressed.>\n\nI had brought barrels of cinderbrew to help the injured. I thought drinking it would ease their pain, but for most it just caused more... burning... pain...\n\nI refuse to let my brew go to waste. Maybe it can be weaponized. The nerubians are just bugs after all--organic and flameable.\n\nThis burrow here is a perfect test subject.",
