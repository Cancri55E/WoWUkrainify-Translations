    "Description": "While you were dealing with the tunnels and the workmasters, I saw a peculiar kobold go into a cave to the northwest. The Kobolds seemed to respect him more than the others, calling him Grand-Heister Bokk and offering him the food you call \"cheese.\" This makes me think he is the real mastermind.\n\nIf that kobold is in fact the real Ward of this operation, then we should take the opportunity to strike him down.\n\nI will meet you at this cave.",
