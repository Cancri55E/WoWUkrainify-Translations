    "Description": "I'll tell you what I told Baelgrim when we last spoke. The binding of stormrooks is wrong. These creatures are as smart as any earthen. Some I'd say are smarter.\n\nBut... Lufsela seems to be different. If her stormrook follows her willingly, then perhaps others will make that choice as well if she summons them.\n\nTo summon rooks, we need Baelgrim's conduit. It's tucked away here somewhere. Have a look around, and maybe ask these pilgrims if they have seen it.",

    "CompletionText": "Have you found the conduit?",
    "RewardText": "Not only was Olbarig once a Stormrider, but he served as Baelgrim's right hand as a Stormguard for a long time. Seems they had a falling out over the rooks.\n\nBut Olbarig says that the conduit will serve as a beacon. If the stormrooks of Skywall are willing, it will guide them through the storm. He also seems to think I should be the one to use it.",
