    "Description": "I saw the shipwright leave the cave and head down to the beach. She was accompanied by a formidable looking nerubian.\n\nThe shipwright is the mastermind behind this entire operation. She knows precisely how the lumber is to be cut and what lumber is needed for their airships.\n\nThe nerubians know this and likely assigned one of their best to protect her.\n\nIf we can eliminate the shipwright, we can bring all of their carefully laid plans to ruin.",
