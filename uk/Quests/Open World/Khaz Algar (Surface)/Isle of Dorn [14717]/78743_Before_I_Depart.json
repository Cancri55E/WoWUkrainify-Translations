That is why I have Urtago here to take over.\n\nBefore my systems grind to a halt, I must make sure Mourning Rise is free of kobolds. They have invaded the memorial site I tend and plunder the Unbound shrines and bodies that are there.\n\nMaybe it is good you are here. You may have the strength to help us.\n\nPlease, help Urtago rid the site of kobolds.",
