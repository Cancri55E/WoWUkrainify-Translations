But looking at Korgran, remembering our last conversation before...\n\nI may not be the Mourning Rise caretaker just yet, but with Korgran's condition, it falls to me to be in charge. \n\nAs Unbound, we made our own rules and traditions. So what if he doesn't want to stand at Mourning Rise? If a seaside memorial is what Caretaker Korgran wants, that's what he gets.\n\n$n, meet me at the shore to the southeast of here.",
