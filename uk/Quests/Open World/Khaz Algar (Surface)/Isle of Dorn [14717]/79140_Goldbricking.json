    "Description": "Is this what we are to rely on to help us defeat Xal'atath? The Unbound define themselves by their desertion. And the Oathsworn, for being made of stone, are pretty soft. City life hasn't done them any favors. \n\nWe've got a lot of work to do.\n\nGet down there and give these earthen a taste of what it's like to face a real threat. Try not to knock any \"offline,\" but a maiming here or there would send a strong message to the rest.",

    "CompletionText": "Don't go easy on them. They're made of stone after all.",
    "RewardText": "You lit a fire down there, and we will continue to fan the flames. \n\nGo now, secure in knowing you have helped set these earthen on the path to glory. The nerubians won't know what hit them!",
