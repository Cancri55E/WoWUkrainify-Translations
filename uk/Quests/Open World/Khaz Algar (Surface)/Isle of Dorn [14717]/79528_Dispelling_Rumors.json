    "Description": "Many of my peacekeepers have already caught wind of Ardgrin's sedition.\n\nI am told some are losing faith in my integrity as Councilward, believing that I have been taking bribes from smugglers to bolster my own coffers.\n\nI can provide proof that no such transactions have taken place--clearly--but we need to stop them from murmuring amongst themselves and giving the rumors power. Lies become truths through repetition.\n\nIf you find any discussing the matter, kindly disperse them.",
