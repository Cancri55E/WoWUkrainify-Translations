Longer, I fear, than Dagran can stay here in the Isles.\n\nBut perhaps... \n\nThere are many titan relics I can use as \"keys\" to unlocking information in the mainframe or to repair it. That may make the process go more quickly.\n\nOnly time will tell.\n\nYou have helped us enough, $n. Go back to Moira and tell her what we have discovered.",
