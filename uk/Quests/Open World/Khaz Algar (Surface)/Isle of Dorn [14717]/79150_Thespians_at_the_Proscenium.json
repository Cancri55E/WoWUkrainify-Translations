    "Description": "When I wanted the Unbound to bring their plays to Dornogal, I didn't know what I would be up against. Or that my \"help\" would get in the way.\n\nMy old friend Brokfor keeps interrupting us with his perfectionism. We try to build a set, but he stops everyone to inspect each nail. We try to paint, he complains the colors do not exactly match... you get the idea.\n\nI think Brokfor needs his own project. Maybe... cleaning up the Proscenium? Go ask him to help and keep him occupied.",
