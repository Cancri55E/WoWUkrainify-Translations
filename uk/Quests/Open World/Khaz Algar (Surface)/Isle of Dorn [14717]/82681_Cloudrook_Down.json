    "Title": "Cloudrook Down",
    "Description": "You see that flock in the distance? Wild cloudrooks. \n\nThey've lived on these islands peacefully for ages. But recent events have stirred other elementals from the earth and sea. One of the cloudrooks was attacked, and it was... disincorporated.\n\nNow the flock circles endlessly. Surely they will tire soon. If they get too tired...\n\nPerhaps if we cleared the hostile elementals from this island, they will return and take their rest.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Cull the riled elementals from the central Shield.",
    "CompletionText": "This is the cloudrooks' habitat. Your crash and our war with the nerubians is what caused the other elementals to come.\n\nWe should set this right.",
    "RewardText": "Many thanks for your help, outlander. Though the cloudrooks do not seem any more inclined to return to land.\n\nIf this is some kind of mourning, I worry it could drive the rooks to exhaustion and their own disincorporation. \n\nWe must try something else.",
