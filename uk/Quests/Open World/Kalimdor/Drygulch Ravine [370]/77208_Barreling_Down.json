    "Description": "If it's ale ye be looking for, we've plenty to sample! Or at least we would if the Valdrakken folk would hurry up and bring the rest of the barrels down here.\n\nWe've shipped our Brewfest brews here so they can celebrate--and wouldn't ye know it, they've already started their own traditions! Rolling barrels through the city? That's no way to treat a good brew!\n\nMind lending a hand to bring those barrels down here? And try not to break 'em!",
