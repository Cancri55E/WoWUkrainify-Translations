    "Description": "Our scouts have been combing the Dragon Isles for anything of interest. They've returned much of note, but one discovery stands out amongst the rest--a door.\n\nA door forged by the titans, and sealed against the world. No one has yet managed to find their way through to the artifacts that surely lie within.\n\nBut then, no mystery has endured under the discerning gaze of the Reliquary.\n\nWith the help of the Explorers' League, this challenge will be simple, I am certain.",
