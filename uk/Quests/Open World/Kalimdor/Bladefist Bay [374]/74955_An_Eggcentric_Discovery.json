    "Description": "Have you seen the new eggs this year? Well, you could say they are quite egg-citing!\n\n... Well, I'll get to the point. These new eggs that we've discovered will appear and vanish within minutes! That sounds quite egg-straordinary, right?\n\nLet me know when you're ready and we'll see to it that those eggs appear, but be quick! They'll be gone before you know it.\n\nI'll trade you a more permanent egg when you return with vanishing eggs.",
