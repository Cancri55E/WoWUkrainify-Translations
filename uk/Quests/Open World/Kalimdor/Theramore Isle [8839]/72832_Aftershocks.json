    "Description": "These precocious whelps seem to be trying to recreate the very bomb that leveled Theramore. Predictably, they have yet to succeed. Still, I would rather not give them the chance to stumble into a more effective solution.\n\nIf our dear Aspect wishes to avoid simply turning the whole lot of them into mana dust, then I suppose I can refrain from carpeting the ruin in spellfrost. Someone will need to go and repossess their banal attempts at ordinance, though.\n\nDo take care not to set them off, hmm?",
