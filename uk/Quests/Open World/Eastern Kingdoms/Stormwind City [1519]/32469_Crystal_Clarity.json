I've devised a foolproof way to improve your S.E.L.F.I.E. cam! \n\nIn fact, with just the right gemstones, I can make a lens that would allow us to do all sorts of things!\n\nSome fellow explorers have told me about a large basilisk out on Yojamba Isle in Stranglethorn Vale. Her hide is dotted with tons of high-quality crystals! What a perfect coincidence!\n\nShe sounds pretty tough, though! You should bring some friends!",
