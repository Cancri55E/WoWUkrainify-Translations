    "Description": "Excuse me, $n is it? You've made quite a name for yourself lately, for both the living and the dead. \n\nI have in my possession the Tome of Thomas Thomson. For years it has been in my library, a reminder of times we must not forget. Imagine my surprise when the tome flings itself to the floor, falling open to a page with a single name on it.\n\nYours, $n.\n\nIf Thomas' spirit is trying to reach you, then I think you should take this tome. Perhaps he awaits at the Scarlet Monastery?",
