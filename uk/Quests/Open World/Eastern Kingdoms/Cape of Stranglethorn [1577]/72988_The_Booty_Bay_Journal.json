    "Description": "You will not believe who I read about today in the Booty Bay Journal. What is that look, $p? I too enjoy light reading about world affairs. Booty Bay is fascinating!\n\nRegardless, I read about Zeros--he was once the captive of an evil mage who hated all blue dragons. He seems to have found his own way in the world since his rescue.\n\nA bit of advice for you, young one. Debt is a foolish thing to be in, especially in Booty Bay, and especially to the Baron.\n\nLet's retrieve him before the sharks do.",
