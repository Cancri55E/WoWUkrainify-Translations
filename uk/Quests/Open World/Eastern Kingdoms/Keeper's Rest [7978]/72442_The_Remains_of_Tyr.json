    "Description": "As Nozdormu could sense power lingering in the scale, I can sense Tyr here. It is in the very stones of this place.\n\nI suspect the other constructs can sense it as well. They must have come here when Tyr was reforged. We must be on the right track.\n\nIf something of his presence still remains, the scale should be able to gather it--with the help of this console. But the constructs may interpret our collection of Tyr's last memories as us trying to destroy them. \n\nKeep them away if they awaken.",
