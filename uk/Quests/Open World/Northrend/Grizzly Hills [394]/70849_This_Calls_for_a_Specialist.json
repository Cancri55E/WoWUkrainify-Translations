    "Description": "Lubbins is doing lots better now, but I think he still needs some more help. \n\nA little bit ago I met a super smart Dragonscale Expedition explorer named Haniko who works with proto-drakes all the time. She's a pet trainer, too. I bet she could help Lubbins more! \n\nI think she was going to the Waking Shores. I bet if you go there you'll find her. \n\nI'm so happy I was able to help you! \n\n<she waves happily>\n\nGoodbye! Good luck, Lubbins.",
