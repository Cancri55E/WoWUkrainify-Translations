    "Description": "Like we talked about, Lubbins needs two things: a buddy and a battle.\n\nI think we can get him both at the same time.\n\nThis area is a prime mating ground for Shyflys. If you look around a bit, you're sure to find a bunch.\n\nRemember, you need to weaken it before you can capture it with your trap.\n\nCome back when you have one. It might be a bit bruised after your battle, but I've got some battle-training stones that will fix 'em right up!",
