    "Description": "$n, I am glad to see you! I am worried sick and could use your help.\n\nRecently, I rescued an abandoned proto-drake whelp. I named him Lubbins because he is so lovely! I brought him here to care for him and hopefully find him a good home as someone's pet. \n\nBut now he is missing, and I am concerned that he is lost or hurt. I need to keep watch over the rest of my little ones, otherwise I would go searching for him myself. Would you please look for him?",

    "RewardText": "Thank you, $n. I am so relieved to see little Lubbins safe and sound.\n \nOh! He seems to have taken a liking to you!",
