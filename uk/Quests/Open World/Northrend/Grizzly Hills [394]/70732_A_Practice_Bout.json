Now that you used that stone on Lubbins, let's have a practice bout to test out his skills! \n\nThere's a big ole Hornswog named Gwosh that lives on the shore to the north of here. Gwosh loves to fight! Well, play really. He's super good with other pets, too! \n\nIt'll be a perfect playtime... I mean fight... for Lubbins.",
