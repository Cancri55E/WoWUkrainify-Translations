    "Description": "The man'ari have grown desperate since the Legion fell. Some grasp for power. Some isolate themselves. Others have formed cults awaiting the return of Sargeras. They have faith that he will lead them again one day.\n\nNalridun is the leader of one such cult. They are reclusive, but it is rumored that he has seized an ancient relic that Kil'jaeden kept until his death. Nalridun claims to use it to commune with Sargeras.\n\nI believe I know what this relic is. If I am correct, it must be returned to Velen.",
