    "Description": "My hunters were the ones who found Arzal'kal. They said he helped them fight off several Legion ambushes.\n\nDuring our endless vigil on Argus, we had seen nothing like it. He was not as powerful as some demons, but he was persistent.\n\nHe said he wished to speak with Velen and knew that we had been in contact with him. So, I have fulfilled his request.\n\nIf Velen is all he claims to be, then he would not turn away even the least worthy of his people.\n\nWe will see. I expect little.",
