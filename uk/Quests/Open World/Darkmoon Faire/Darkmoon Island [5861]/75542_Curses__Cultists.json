    "Description": "The wheat has been separated from the chaff. Now the fun can truly begin.\n\nI have an exciting... field trip... planned for our students. But they are not yet ready. Take my grimoire and have the pandaren, zandalari, and tauren try their hand at curses. \n\nI found some uninvited guests loitering on the edges of our fairground. They should make excellent, if unwilling, test subjects.\n\nOman will have the honor of summoning the group far afield, and I will instruct him as such.",
