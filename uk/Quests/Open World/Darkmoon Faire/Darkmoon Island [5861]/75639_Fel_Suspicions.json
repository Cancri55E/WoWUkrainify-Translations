    "Description": "At the risk of stating the obvious, something very wrong is going on.\n\nI know you feel it too.\n\nMadam Shadow is sending myself and the other initiates to the Altar of Storms, to try our hand at summoning demons. Please, $p, poke your head around here and see if you can't piece together what she's up to. \n\nI saw her and her servant heading towards the back of the faire... I'm sure she has her guard up. Maybe there's some way you can get close without drawing attention to yourself?",
