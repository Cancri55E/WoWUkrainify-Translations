    "Description": "That big ol' slag elemental has taken the heart of me forge! Without it, a timeforge is just, well, a forge. And that's no use to a chronosmith!\n\nEven if we had Seashellamayne, I wouldn't be able to repair it.\n\nSuch power cannot be allowed to remain in the possession of that... that molten moron!\n\nThe other elementals took off for the towers. I bet half me beard the big one's close by too.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Retrieve the Heart of the Timeforge.",
    "PortraitGiverName": "Slagnaros",
    "PortraitGiverText": "With the Heart of the Timeforge, Slagnaros now poses a threat to Eon's Fringe and all of the Dragon Isles.",
    "CompletionText": "Those confounded elementals must have come from the heart of me forge. Was it destabilized, somehow?\n\nEither way, it's bad news. Every chronosmith worth their minute knows you don't mix elemental and temporal energies.",
    "RewardText": "<Ironus clutches his chest in relief with a beaming smile.>\n\nThat was a close call! Can you imagine Eon's Fringe burning down shortly after I arrive? How embarrassing.\n\nAnd look at that, one of those wee elementals from me forge seems to have taken a liking to you! You're free to keep it.\n\nIn fact, I insist. Keep it. I don't want it.",
