    "Description": "I have a storage vault in the Passage of Time chock-full of chronomatic crates. They contain timelost artifacts from various timelines.\n\nUnfortunately, me safeguard protocols on the vault itself were damaged by those blasted time rifts. I did a quick fly-about and saw those infernal looters scattering my crates everywhere!\n\nSince you're heading that way, can you grab some of my possessions as you go? Not all of them, of course! Just the important stuff.",
