As you can see, the time anomaly around Eon's Fringe has dissipated and there is no shortage of work to be done.\n\nWe've called in for help from one our best chronosmiths, a bronze dragon by the name of Ironormu. The problem, amongst all this chaos, is that he's nowhere to be found. He should have been back from setting up his workshop by now.\n\n<Tempo sighs in agitation.>\n\nCan you go find him?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Seek out Ironormu at the forge in Eon's Fringe.",

Not only is me forge sealed with a timelock, it's filled to the brim with fire elementals!\n\nTo make things worse, young Finduin here is in DIRE need of a talented chronosmith to repair his blade, Seashellamayne. And I can't exactly do much when me forge is...\n\n<Ironus gestures wildly in frustration.>\n\nI'd be mighty appreciative if you could help me out.",
