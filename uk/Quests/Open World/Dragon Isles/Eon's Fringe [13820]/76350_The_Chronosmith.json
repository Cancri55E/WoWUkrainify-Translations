As you can see, the time anomaly around Eon's Fringe has dissipated and there is no shortage of work to be done.\n\nWe've called in for help from one our best chronosmiths, a bronze dragon by the name of Ironormu. The problem, amongst all this chaos, is that he's nowhere to be found. He should have been back from setting up his workshop by now.\n\n<Tempo sighs in agitation.>\n\nCan you go find him?",
