    "Description": "You say that Tempo mentioned objects from other timelines?\n\nI have a device used for syncing melodies. Strangely enough, it seems to have the same effect on timelines in this town. Perhaps a side effect of the chaotic temporal energies here?\n\nI've upgraded Pedgi's glasses to allow him to observe the rhythms of the world. They may make it easier to find mis-timed entities. Ask if you can borrow them.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Use Melly's device near objects from other timelines. Pedgi's sunglasses will make them easier to find.",
    "RewardText": "Looks like the mis-timed objects are back in their proper place. One less thing for Tempo to worry about.\n\nHmm... Interesting data here. Perhaps it will come in handy later.\n\nApologies that Pedgi hasn't been much help. Probably best to muster up his resolve. This is his song to compose, after all.",
