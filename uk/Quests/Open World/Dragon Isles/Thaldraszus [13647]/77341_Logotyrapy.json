    "Description": "Dear $p,\n\nIt seems wrong to say this of someone as mighty as Tyr, but I am worried about him. When he arrived at Tyr's Rest, he spent many days talking with us. We all asked him many questions, learning about the titans, ancient history, and his philosophy.\n\nBut recently, Tyr has been speaking less, and the answers he does give are shorter and some have an edge to them.\n\nI'm not sure what's wrong, but something is different. Will you come speak with him?\n\nFor Tyr,\nValunei",
