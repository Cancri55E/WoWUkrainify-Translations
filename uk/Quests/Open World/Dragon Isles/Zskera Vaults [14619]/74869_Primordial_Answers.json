    "Description": "Revelations await us within this vault. Perhaps we'll find a way to protect ourselves against Primalist magic. The elementals hiding in these vaults are wild, ancient, and free of Primalist control. Perhaps they hold the secret to helping the elementals on the surface.\n\nI have an idea. We'll need four primordial cores. Then we can construct a talisman that can purify and remove the influence of Primalist control from the elementals outside.\n\nIf you help us, I will share what we have found here.",
