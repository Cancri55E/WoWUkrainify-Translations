    "Description": "I believe the Silver Scale may still be of some use to us. During my observations, I felt an... energy in it that transcends time and seems to be attuned to Tyr. It also has the same architecture as the disc.\n\nIt stands to reason we may use the Silver Scale to collect one of Tyr's memories that he did not commit to the disc.\n\nThough it seems macabre, going to his tomb in Tirisfal may allow us to at least partially restore him.\n\nAlexstrasza can tell you more, $n.",
