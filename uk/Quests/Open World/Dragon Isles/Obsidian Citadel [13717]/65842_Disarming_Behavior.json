They follow a misplaced belief that Deathwing himself will return one day, and they will not help us with the Obsidian Throne.\n\nWeaponmaster Vordak, who once swore loyalty to the Black Prince, has stolen many weapons crafted here in the Citadel and given them to the Worldbreakers. I will not allow such theft. Or such betrayal.\n\nGo to Smoldering Peak and recover the weapons... by force if necessary.",
