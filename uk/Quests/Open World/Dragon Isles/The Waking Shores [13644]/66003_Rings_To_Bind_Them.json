    "Description": "The djaradin here have become bold, binding flame elementals and letting them rampage through the area. The wildlife has fled, and the elementals are dangerously close to our camps.\n\nLuckily, I have been able to construct a small bastion of stone to stand against this fiery tide the djaradin have unleashed... and we will not fall!\n\nGather the magical rings that bind these flame elementals. We shall use them to bolster our defenses against the flame elementals.",
