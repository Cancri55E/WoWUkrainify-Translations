I can't believe Tutaqan's still moping around when we need him to command his guards and hunters!\n\nWe used to trade with the Iskaara at our pier, but that's gone belly up with the djaradin closing in and scaring off our traders. Half of last month's supplies and most of our boats are still lost out in the shallow river.\n\nThe guards and hunters want to help, but they've got no weapons. You look like you can protect yourself, so get out there and grab something I can make spears with!",
