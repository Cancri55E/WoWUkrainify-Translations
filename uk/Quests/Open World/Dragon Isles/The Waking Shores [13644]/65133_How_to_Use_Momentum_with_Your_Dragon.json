    "Description": "Now what if there is an obstacle in your way?\n\nAs long as you fly well, you can conserve your momentum and gain some height after a dive.\n\nWhen you dive this time you will find your flight path takes you below the landing area. By using your momentum you can regain lost height at the end of the course to still land in the target area.\n\nIf you find yourself stuck, use the Bronze Timepiece and Celormu will reset you.",
