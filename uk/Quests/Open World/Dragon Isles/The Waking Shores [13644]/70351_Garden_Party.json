    "Description": "I've been tending to this garden for years, preparing for the day I'd finally accept my Lifecalling. Now that day is here!\n\nI love flowers and all trees and plants--even the bugs that live amongst them. I can feel nature's spirit--the Great Dragon Spirit--when I tend the garden.\n\nThere's only one thing left to do. I'm going to invoke Great Dragon Spirit, just like the legends.\n\n<Akora smiles brightly.>\n\nMeet me down in the garden by the pool where her bones rest. I'll explain more there.",
