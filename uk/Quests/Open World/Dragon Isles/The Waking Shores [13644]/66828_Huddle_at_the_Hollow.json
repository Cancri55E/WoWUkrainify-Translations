    "Description": "I've never seen Akora this upset. Usually she's as sunny as her flowers, but that legend means a lot to her. She talks about it all the time. Hm...\n\n<Keshki fidgets with their glasses.>\n\nI don't know a lot about plants, and I don't think frogs would cheer up anyone but me...\n\nBut north of here there's a quiet spot where I do my thinking: Hornswog Hollow. Maybe we can find something to cheer her up there? Or, uh, try to formulate a plan to help?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Meet Keshki at Hornswog Hollow.",
    "RewardText": "As much as I want to cheer up Akora, $n, taking care of these poor frogs is a bigger priority.\n\nFor the red dragonflight, preserving life always comes first!",
