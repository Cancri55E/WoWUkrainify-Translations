    "Description": "Want the honor of assisting world-renowned Head Geologist of the Dragonscale Expedition? That's right. I'm exactly who you think I am. And I'm in a bind!\n\nI was perusing this river for new sedimentary samples, but then the water started to walk away with the most interesting pieces of silt!\n\nI have here my patented water entrapment device, but it's in desperate need of someone to march around and siphon those elementals into it.\n\nThink you're up to the task?",

    "RewardText": "Yes, that's it! That's the composition I was looking for! Thank you! Finally, someone knows when to listen to me.\n\nDo me a favor and don't mention this to anyone back at basecamp, got it? My thesis is still in progress, and I'm supposed to be writing about volcanic sedimentary sources. I'm sure you can understand, yeah?",
