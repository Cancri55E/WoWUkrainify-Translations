    "Description": "In delving into the archives here, I've found threads that point towards the Obsidian Observatory as a place of personal importance to the Earth-Warder. I can only guess what knowledge it may contain about the history of our flight.\n\nGiven Emberthal's interest in the subject, I informed her of my discovery. I pray that wasn't a mistake.\n\nShe has gone ahead to scout. Please, keep an eye on her. She is a competent soldier, but this subject is... troubling. Who knows what truths you may uncover.",
