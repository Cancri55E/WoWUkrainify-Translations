    "Description": "Unujaak told you to come, didn't he? He was the one who helped me find Ipko when I became a hunter--or, rather, helped Ipko find me. They choose and we are chosen.\n\nHe is hurting. Everyone is hurting because of me. I know that they need me to lead, but I have been half of a leader without her. If I couldn't protect her, how can I protect all of Uktulut?\n\n<He takes a deep breath.>\n\nI cannot forgive myself. But I cannot let that weight keep me from putting at least one foot on the path I must walk.",
