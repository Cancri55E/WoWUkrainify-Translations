    "Description": "Greetings, adventurer! Say, you look like a capable person. Could you give me a hand?\n\nAzkra and I are charged with watching over this tower, which is in what I like to call \"an exciting state of pre-renovation.\" My problem is as we started repairs, the local earth elementals attacked us! \n\nSo I thought \"Zefren, why not take care of the earth elementals and get some building materials at the same time?\" Which is where you come in! Could you help?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Obtain Building Materials from the local Earth Elementals.",
    "RewardText": "Oh bother, these are quite a bit more crumbly than I was expecting. They look quite a lot more solid when they are launched at your head! \n\nWell. I'm sure I can use these for building regardless, thank you for your help! \n\nMaybe there are some mud elementals around here somewhere I can use to glue it together....",
