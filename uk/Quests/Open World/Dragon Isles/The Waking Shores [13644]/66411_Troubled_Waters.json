    "Description": "It saddens me to see our chieftain like this, but our needs cannot wait.\n\nThe river has provided for us for generations. But as the djaradin push forward, the waters recede, and the creatures fight with each other for space and resources. \n\nWithout guards, our anglers cannot venture far to fish. Our food stores dwindle by the day.\n\nYou do not seem to need protection though. Take this net to help gather any fish you can from the river. Meat from the nearby crabs would also be welcome.",
