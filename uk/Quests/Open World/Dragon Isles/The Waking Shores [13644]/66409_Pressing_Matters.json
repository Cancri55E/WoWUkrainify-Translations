We don't need outsiders bringing more of it.\n\nIf you want our time, make yourself useful and help our guards. The djaradin have been attacking us from across the river. Flameshaper Lorak is behind the assault. He may not look like much as far as djaradin go, but he's got more brains than the rest of them.\n\nDeal with him and bring back proof. Then we'll talk.",
