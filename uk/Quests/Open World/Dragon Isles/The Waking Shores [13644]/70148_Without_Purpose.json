He asked my associates and me all kinds of questions, but seemed... disappointed with our answers.\n\nHe called himself \"Talon Ethrethi\". I believe that makes him quite junior amongst your ranks?\n\nI got the sense that he could use a hand. Mind helping me keep the peace?\n\nI saw him talking with Kholmar over there.",
