    "Description": "Vaeros is diligent, but whelps have a way of finding trouble. Not mine, of course--but I suppose not every dragon rears their clutch to understand the gravity of their station.\n\nWhile I am loathe to encourage outdoor play over study, I will help you safeguard the garden more effectively. Take these seeds and plant them nearby.
