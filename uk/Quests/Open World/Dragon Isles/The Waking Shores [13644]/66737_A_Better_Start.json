    "Description": "Vaeros is diligent, but whelps have a way of finding trouble. Not mine, of course--but I suppose not every dragon rears their clutch to understand the gravity of their station.\n\nWhile I am loathe to encourage outdoor play over study, I will help you safeguard the garden more effectively. Take these seeds and plant them nearby. When mature, the blooms produce a fragrance that insects find disagreeable.\n\nThe gardeners can help you--and maybe my bronze brethren, if you mind your manners.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Plant seeds in 6 Fertile Soil patches and allow them to mature.",
    "RewardText": "I am rather surprised you did not earn more than a scathing reproach from Veladormi. She must be feeling generous today.\n\nI suspect the insect problem is now solved. You are welcome.",
