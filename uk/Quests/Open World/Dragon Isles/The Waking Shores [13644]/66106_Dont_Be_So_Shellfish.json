    "Description": "I was a fool to doubt Iskha when he insisted there was more to this. He wouldn't be my mate if he wasn't always two steps ahead of me.\n\nWe can make it up to him--by taking action, of course. If it's shells that are causing all this elemental chaos, why don't you go into their camp and take those shells right out of their slimy hands?\n\nBring back piles of the wind and water shells, enough for Iskha to research to his heart's content.",
