But there are some enemies that should never be allowed on our shores.\n\nIn the east, naga are advancing on our beaches and coves. They've brought supplies with them. If we could reduce the local naga population and seize their supplies, our chances of survival here would increase.  \n\nHere's the plan: take those supplies from their caches or their corpses, and slay their leader. Lives are on the line.",
