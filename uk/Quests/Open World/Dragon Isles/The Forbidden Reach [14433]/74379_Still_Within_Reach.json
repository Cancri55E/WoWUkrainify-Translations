    "Description": "While we dracthyr were kept in stasis, the Spellsworn, ancient servants of Malygos the Spellweaver, were our wardens. However, despite being slain years ago, the late Aspect's forces are still loyal to him and his lasting directive to keep this island contained. They present a danger to any dracthyr still lost, wounded, or otherwise unaccounted for.\n\nScouts have reported the sighting of a rather large Spellsworn brute hunting for escaped dracthyr. This deadly pursuer must be dealt with.",
