    "Description": "This place... I have not been here for a long time. Not since before I was a Scalecommander. \n\nIt is a dark place, full of pain... and failure. \n\nThis was where Neltharion tested those he considered most worthy of his attention. He poked and prodded us with powers we could not understand or control.\n\nMany of us were found... wanting.\n\nPerhaps Sarkareth brought me here to test me the same way our father tested us.\n\nWill you walk with me?",
