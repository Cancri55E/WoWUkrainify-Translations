    "Description": "We are by no means ready to relax, but at least our encampment here is stable... for the time being. I should be able to handle the rest of our operation from here.\n\nEmberthal arrived while you were in the field. She and her allies are surveying the area from the cliffs above. It would be wise to check in with her, I think. We would not want her to attempt taking the Reach alone.",
