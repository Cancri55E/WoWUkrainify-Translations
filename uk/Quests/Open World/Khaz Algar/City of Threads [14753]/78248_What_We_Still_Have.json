    "Description": "I went into the city prepared--prepared to end this war even if I was ended with it.\n\nBut I am alive. As are you. As is Anduin. We have new allies and a new way forward. I realize at this moment that my vision may have been obscured by my guilt.\n\nPart of me feels those words are Anduin's, not mine. Perhaps he's rubbing off on me.\n\nLet us return to your Weaver's Lair. I wish to see yours and Anduin's efforts to save these people as well as our own through.",

    "RewardText": "How many times were my suspicions diverted from Executor Nizrek's true identity as the \"Vizier?\" Perhaps I've lost my step. Me! A master of spycraft.\n\nHah--far more likely, it is that he's simply much better than I give him credit for.\n\nI find myself quite stirred by the knowledge that someone's gift for subterfuge may rival my own. We shall work together quite nicely.",
