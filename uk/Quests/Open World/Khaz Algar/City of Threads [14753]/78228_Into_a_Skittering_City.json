    "Description": "I sent these 'invitations' to you and Alleria, both. I'd have bet my father's sword you wouldn't let such a unique opportunity pass you by--it's what sets you apart from us all. Alleria, however...\n\nNevermind. She's as cautious as she is assertive. I suppose I was hoping for the latter, but it's the former that's kept her alive.\n\nPerhaps she'll find us later on. For now, it's time you and my new acquaintance properly meet.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Tell the Vizier of The Weaver's plan, and apply Pheromones for access to the Umbral Bazaar.",
    "RewardText": "Quite the entrance. I should replicate it in the next cabinet meeting.\n\n<Nizrek emits a cough you imagine might be a chuckle.>\n\nPerhaps we should give them a private moment. Whilst we let them have it, would you hear out a small request of mine?",
