    "Description": "Ah, look at you! Just the sort of rogue element I need.\n\nMy name is Ar'syn, and I am something of a connoisseur for the fine arts and histories of our people. It is my intent to enter the Royal Preservatory--that's that large enclave just over there-- and rob it blind.\n\nBut gracious, the guards will never let me get close enough to survey their security! If only I had someone to help me find a somewhat more subtle way into the building.\n\n<Ar'syn looks at you meaningfully.>",
    "ObjectivesText": "Survey three potential entryways into the Royal Preservatory.",
    "RewardText": "Say what you will about our new queen, but she knows how to run a tight ship. They are ferrying their spoils of war into the building at a remarkable rate.\n\nBut then, that may well be your ticket inside.",
