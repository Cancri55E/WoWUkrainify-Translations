    "Description": "The Relics of Founding have always been the centerpieces of the Preservatory's collection. Together, those four artifacts tell our most reverent tale--that of the founding of Azj-Kahet, and of our people's rejection of our Old Masters.\n\nWith luck, they will still be inside the Preservatory. Once you are inside, I want you to tamper with the shadecasters in front of each of the relics. Make sure that their messages are heard by anyone nearby--whether they wish to listen or not.",
