    "Description": "It's going to ruin everything! Who wants to visit a resort with a thirty-foot tall ghost-deer? Ok, no need to panic. It's probably just a little miffed you took its skull.\n\nFirst, you gotta get rid of some of these slimes. Then, get that skull out of here. The farther the better.\n\nOh man, they're gonna get ectoplasm in the hot pools!",
