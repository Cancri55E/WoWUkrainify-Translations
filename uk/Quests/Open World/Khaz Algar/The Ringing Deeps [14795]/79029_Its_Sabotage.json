    "Description": "We're back, and we're ready.\n\nYou and ZZ-01-47 head in and cause some mayhem. Blow stuff and make a mess that will draw them out of the manufacturing bay. I'll use the commotion to sneak inside. Join me when you're able, and we should have a chance at reactivating the facility and driving them out.\n\nWe don't need to defeat them all. Defeating the Darkfuse leader supervising this operation should break their resolve.\n\nThe Darkfuse lackeys will clear out when the coin stops flowing.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Wreak havoc, gain access to the manufacturing bay, and restart the facility.",
    "RewardText": "It was touch and go there for a bit. But if anyone could seize a victory out of this, I knew it would be you.\n\nPlease return to the Emissary in Dornogal and communicate our victory. Go with my thanks, and with the knowledge that the Machine Speakers are indebted to you. Again.",
