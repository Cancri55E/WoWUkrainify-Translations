    "Description": "I suppose I should come clean and tell you why I had you gather that meat.\n\nTruth is, there's a horrible beast who lives down in the Wastes. A monster who feeds on the unwary and whose pincers can snap through stone and bone like a knife through warm butter. \n\nIts name is Smaragthr, and the foul thing is the reason I have but one eye and my gems are cracked. I am no match for it, but you... you could enact my vengeance. \n\nKill Smaragthr so the Wastes can be free!",
