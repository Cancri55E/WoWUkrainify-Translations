    "Description": "This is Ausgazur. His hand is usually full of a selection of his favorite gems. We don't really know what it's like when we go into stasis, but he wanted to spend his last moments contemplating the natural beauty of Azeroth and her bounty.\n\nI am afraid someone or something has made off with the jewels he usually holds. Let's look around. See if you can find any clues where they may have gone off to.",

    "CompletionText": "Ausgazur will never forgive me if his gems go missing. This is very upsetting. Who would steal from an earthen in stasis?",
    "RewardText": "Kobolds made off with his gems? This is unacceptable! We must recover the rest of Ausgazur's jewels!",
