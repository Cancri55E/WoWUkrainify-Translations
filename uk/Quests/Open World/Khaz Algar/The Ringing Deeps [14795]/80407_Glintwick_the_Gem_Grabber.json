    "Description": "The kobold mentioned Glintwick, did he? It sounds like she's the driving force behind these gem thieves. I'll bet my beard she's got Ausgazur's last gem!\n\nLook for her in the Waterworks and see if she has the final gem. She may also be behind the attack that's happening, so taking her out will help the defenders.",

    "PortraitGiverName": "Glintwick",
    "PortraitGiverText": "Crowned with a candle whose wick is studded with stolen jewels, Glintwick's eyes gleam with a greedy lust for gems.",
    "CompletionText": "Glintwick will not get away with this thievery!",
    "RewardText": "You did it! You found the last gem! I'm glad that Glintwick will no longer be after Ausgazur's gems.\n\nThis particular gem was his favorite. It's not faceted, like the rest. Ausgazur could always find the beauty in flawed things. He would show me this one and marvel at its hue and potential. He never wanted it buffed or shined.\n\n<She's silent a moment, then looks at the gray earthen beside her.>\n\nAh, Ausgazur. You never cared what I looked like either. You saw my potential. I miss you, friend.",
