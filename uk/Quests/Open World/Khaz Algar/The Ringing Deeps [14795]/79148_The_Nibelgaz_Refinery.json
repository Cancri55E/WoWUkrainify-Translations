    "Description": "Quickly! Elementals have overrun the Nibelgaz Mine and the refinery crew are trapped down there with them. \n\nI am especially worried about my fused, Munderut. His memory is not the best these days. If you are a friend, rescue him and the refinery workers.\n\nHere, take this healing clay. It only helps a little, but it should be enough for any injured to make their way back. I wish we had a rejuvenating crystal, but that is the stuff of legends.",
