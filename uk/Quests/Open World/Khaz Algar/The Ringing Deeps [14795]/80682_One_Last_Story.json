    "Description": "Well, it's time. I'll be holding the recitation at the mine entrance. I'll see you there, though don't feel obligated to stay the whole time.\n\nI'll leave my book for Haimaz to find. She'll take care of it.\n\nAfter the ceremony, I would like to say goodbye properly. Meet me by the bridge outside of town. I'll head there after the recitation.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Attend the recitation.",
    "RewardText": "I knew Brennok was acting odd. Then one of the miners mentioned you'd borrowed a spare set of clothes. That and his strange mood, well, it wasn't hard to guess that he planned to leave.\n\nI expected him to come this way, though. Have you seen him?",
