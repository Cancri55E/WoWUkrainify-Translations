    "Description": "Now there's one last thing we need. It wouldn't be a proper recitation ceremony without mead. \n\nHowever, Hearthkeeper Zirc tells me the last couple deliveries of cinderbrew haven't arrived. It seems the local flayers in the Rumbling Wastes have a taste for it and raid the shipments.\n\nHere, take a spare keg. See what you can recover from the flayers.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Fill a keg with Cinderbrew Mead.",
    "CompletionText": "Careful out there, flayers are already dangerous enough. I wouldn't want to meet one that's been guzzling cinderbrew.",
    "RewardText": "Thank you, the miners will appreciate this. I hope the flayers weren't too much trouble.",
