    "Description": "Greetings! I am Kagfritha. I was once a site supervisor for operations in the Rumbling Wastes to the south of here, but time has taken its toll on our enterprise and we had to abandon the area. \n\nIt's high time we got things back in working order down there, but while we were gone some unsavory creatures moved in. I have a plan for dealing with the worst of the bunch, but first we need some bait. \n\nIf you're here to help, go hunt some of those dirt diving krolusks and bring me back their meat.",
