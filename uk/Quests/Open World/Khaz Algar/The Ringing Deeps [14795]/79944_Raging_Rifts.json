    "Description": "The elementals are coming from inside that cave. We only made it part of the way in before needing to retreat. \n\nI could see some flickering within, some strange glowing thing that looked almost like a tear in space from which the elementals poured forth! We managed to close one of these portals, but there are more.\n\nI need to stay with Nanthaz. It is up to you now, if you can manage. Destroy the rifts and find their source. I suspect it lies deeper within the cave.",
