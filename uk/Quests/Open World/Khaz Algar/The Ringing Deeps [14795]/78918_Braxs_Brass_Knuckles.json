    "Description": "I have a proposition for you.\n\nWe get some rowdy patrons here from time to time. Nothing sinister, but our folk work hard and things can get out of hand faster than a dropped hammer. \n\nUsually I'd give 'em a considerate knock upside the head to remind them what's what, but I lost my brass knuckles while helping Watcher Toki clear monsters on the town's skirts.\n\nMind fetching my knuckles and administering some love taps?",

    "RewardText": "That's the genius of the knuckles. They keep your hands intact!",
