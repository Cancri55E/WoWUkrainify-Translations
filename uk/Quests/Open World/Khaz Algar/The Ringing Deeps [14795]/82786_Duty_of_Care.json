    "Description": "The golem is unstable. I doubt it can travel far. We will track it, but haste failed me once already. Arbauch showed true devotion to the machines--we will follow his example. Repairs must come first.\n\nMachine systems are delicate. We must activate the backup before the failure can cascade. Exterminate any pests you find as well. Even the smallest creature can ruin delicate machinery.\n\nI am damaged. I will send my cogwalker with you to relay instructions.",

    "CompletionText": "Our primary duty is to mend.",
