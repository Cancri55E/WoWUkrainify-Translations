    "Description": "Welcome, stalwart colleague, to Shimmermist Falls! It's always damp here--a thriving paradise for green, living things. Unfortunately, it's also the perfect climate for moss to grow on my inert earthen charges. \n\nWe'll need to gather a few supplies for removing the moss. First, we need a sponge to wash their surfaces. It needs to be soft enough to not damage them but strong enough to hold up to an earthen's rough stone skin. \n\nThe caps from the lashrooms down below are perfect!",
