    "Title": "Buckets and Blooms",
    "Description": "Down among the creeping lashrooms grows an orange flower. When mixed with water, its blooms make a caustic solvent that is perfect for removing moss from earthen skin.\n\nI also left a bucket next to this earthen the last time I was here, which I use make the solvent. Something seems to have made off with it.\n\nCould I delegate the task of gathering these to you? I'll wait here. The moles from the terrace have given me enough excitement for one day.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 8 caustic blooms and find the missing bucket.",
    "CompletionText": "The acidity from the plants is strong enough to remove the moss but gentle enough not to harm the earthen. Plus it has a pleasing smell to it. Almost like sulfur.",
    "RewardText": "Ah, I can smell the sulfur from here! Thank you for gathering the bucket and blooms.\n\nNot everyone shares my taste, but I enjoy a bowl of lightly seared magma in an igneous bowl, especially when the fumes are particularly sulfurous. \n\nWhat? You've never tried it? To each their own.",
