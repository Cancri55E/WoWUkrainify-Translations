    "Description": "I tracked down a distress signal that led me to this little maintenance machine. A curious find, but the real treasure is the defunct war golem facility to the southeast.\n\nIf we can start producing war golems again we'll be able to contribute to the war effort. Unfortunately, it's been overrun by a goblin salvage group. And we'll need to investigate and assess if the facility is functional.\n\nFortunately, I have a plan, and it involves our little friend here. Why don't you introduce yourself?",

    "CompletionText": "With your assistance, I think we can find a way to clear this place out.",
    "RewardText": "Now that introductions are out of the way. Let's sneak our way into this facility.",
