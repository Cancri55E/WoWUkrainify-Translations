    "Description": "I am seeking my mentor, Foreman Arbauch. He is... missing. Under other circumstances, I would send for a search party from Gundargaz, but there is no time.\n\nI suspect he passed through here, but the only lead I have is DelGizmo. He wants the local fog beasts removed. Reluctance. But if he has seen Arbauch, I must learn what he knows.\n\nThe Lurkers to the south carry powerful Galvanic Glands. They have enough charge to disperse even the thickest fog. Retrieve some. Compensation assured.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 6 Galvanic Glands.",
    "CompletionText": "Haste is appreciated. I must find Arbauch.",
    "RewardText": "Approval. These seem quite energetic. They will allow you to scare off the fog beasts for DelGizmo.",
