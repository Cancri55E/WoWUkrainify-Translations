    "Description": "I've been away too long. The Machine Speakers are clearly not faring well here. Does the High Speaker know about this?\n\nNerubian sabotage and gross negligence are a devastating combination. We need to get Ironhaul Station up and running as soon as possible. It's a vital link between the Ringing Deeps and the city up above.\n\nPlease, $p, help our injured workers, collect any salvageable cargo, and restore safety to Ironhaul Station.",

    "CompletionText": "Dead nerubian skitterlings, unexploded bombs, injured workers... what a mess.",
    "RewardText": "Thank you for getting the workers on their feet. You've restored order, or at least enough for us to get back to work.\n\nThe best way to impress Foreman Uzjax is by getting work done, and you're doing that.\n\n*whispers* ... but tread carefully. He's loyal to the powers that be, so we should watch what we say.",
