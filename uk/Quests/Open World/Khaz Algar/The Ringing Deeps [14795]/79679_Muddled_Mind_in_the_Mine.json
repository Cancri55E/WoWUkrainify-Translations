    "Description": "The workers said they saw Munderut near the back of the mining area. Please find him and tell him that I said he needs to report back in. \n\nHe might not remember me, or that I am his fused. Tell him to look down at his chest, at the medallion he wears. His memory of our time together fades in and out these days, but the medallion tells of our story and bond forever.",
