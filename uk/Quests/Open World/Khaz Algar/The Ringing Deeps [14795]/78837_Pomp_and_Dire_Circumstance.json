    "Description": "I'm seeing legitimate concerns. We have to do something about the nerubians... even if the High Speaker won't. If he won't do something, I will.\n\nThe High Speaker sent me to the surface because I wasn't \"reasonable.\" I think we should have a chance to... reason... with him.

    "RewardText": "So much for reason. \n\nThe Ringing Deeps has plenty of problems, and the High Speaker is obviously distracted. He sounds obsessed! \n\n$n, if you and your companions can help us solve some of our challenges here, maybe I can convince the Machine Speakers to help you against the nerubians. That's a problem that concerns us all.",
