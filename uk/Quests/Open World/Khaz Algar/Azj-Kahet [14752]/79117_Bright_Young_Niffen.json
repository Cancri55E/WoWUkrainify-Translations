    "Description": "You need swarmhands, huh? \n\nLast time the nerubians wanted our help, they tried to force us. They're terrible negotiators! All we wanted was a little quid pro quo.\n\nWe've got several arachnologists, but most of them are busy keeping the flyers at bay. I'm sure they won't refuse an opportunity to study some swarmbeasts up close and personal! \n\nMaybe if you lighten their workload, they'll take you up on your offer.",
