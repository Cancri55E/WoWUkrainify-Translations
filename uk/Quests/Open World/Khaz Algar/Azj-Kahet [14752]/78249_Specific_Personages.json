    "Description": "Zev'kall has recently placed his own loyal lackeys in key positions around Siegehold. Killing them will force replacements, which will cause chaos and re-training.\n\nAll of which will make Zev'kall struggle. Get rid of all three.",

    "CompletionText": "All three must be removed from office.",
    "RewardText": "Zev'kall knows that I am involved. I wanted him to know. But he can say nothing, because he is unable to make his own pheromone marks. I have used mine for his needs, so far. \n\nIf he admits he can't, everyone would question his authority... not to mention his status as a nerubian.\n\nIt is quite a scandal.",
