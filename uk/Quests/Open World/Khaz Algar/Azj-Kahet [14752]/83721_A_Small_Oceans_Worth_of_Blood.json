    "Description": "Excellent! The end draws near! But although we near completion, we cannot go without the most important part of this genetic equation--the blood. We need a small ocean's worth of nerubian blood. \n\nHowever, to make this new form foolproof, the blood must come from the strongest nerubians to exist.
