If she's more sensitive to this...\n\n<Hannan nearly growls.>\n\nBut she's making a mess out here, drawing attention and leaving a trail leading outsiders right to her! Right to us.\n\nWe're supposed to be subtle. Unseen. Keep to the brush, hide in our other forms as much as possible.\n\nI hate to ask this of you, but can you use my scythe to take care of the evidence while I check on her?",
