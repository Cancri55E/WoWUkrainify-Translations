    "Description": "While we're here, I must find out what happened to my old friend, Ryton Blackholme. He was Hallowfall's finest blacksmith--and he was taken in a surprise nerubian attack. I could not save him.\n\nI searched for him, but found nothing except for his bloodied helm. I'd given up hope. But recently, I heard rumor about a blacksmith from a survivor who'd been pulled down off the Aegis Wall.\n\nCould it be Ryton? Will you help me, $n?",
