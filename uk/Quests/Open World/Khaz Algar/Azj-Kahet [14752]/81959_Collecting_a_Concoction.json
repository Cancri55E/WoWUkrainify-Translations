    "Description": "The Pale Weavelashers did indeed throw my alchemical supply down the cliffside. The potions will give the citizens of the Silken Ward the edge they need to rise up.\n\nI need someone to go down the Whispering Cliffs and collect any bottles that haven't broken open. I would go myself but the kobyss have made the area a hunting ground and I'm no fighter.\n\nThis would be a simple task for one such as yourself, eh?",
