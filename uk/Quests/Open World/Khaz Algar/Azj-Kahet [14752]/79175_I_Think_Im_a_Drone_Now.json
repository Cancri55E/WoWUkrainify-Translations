    "Description": "There, I have extended some goodwill. You have a little goblin friend. I know how much your kind clings to each other for warmth.\n\nAnd now you both will do things for me. First, I will provide you with my pheromone scent mark. It will keep my loyal soldiers from attacking you. It marks you as mine.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Allow Anub'azal to mark you with his pheromones.",
    "CompletionText": "Don't waste my time. Are you ready to accept my mark? Step into the pheromone cloud with your goblin friend, and rub it on.",
    "RewardText": "Your friend complains, but my mark will keep you relatively safe, except from Zev'kall's guards. They won't care about scent marks if they are already hostile to me.\n\nSo make the most of it, but take care.",
