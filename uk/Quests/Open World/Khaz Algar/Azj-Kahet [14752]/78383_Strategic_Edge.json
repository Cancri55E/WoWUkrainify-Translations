    "Description": "To add insult to injury, they disarmed me. I'm not leaving without those blades!\n\nWhile we're looking, keep an eye out for any evidence of what's going on here. Anything that could give us an advantage against the nerubians.\n\nSomething strange happened that provided us the opening to escape. I have a feeling that could be something we can exploit.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Find Flynn's Blades and 3 nerubian intel from Kaheti forces in Rak-Zakaz.",
    "CompletionText": "There must be something around here of value to the Weaver...",
    "RewardText": "This seems like enough to trade to the Weaver for that antidote. Anub'azal is a good lead to investigate. Maybe he'll barter like the Weaver did, and we'll get something even better from him.\n\nIt sounds like a good risk to me.",
