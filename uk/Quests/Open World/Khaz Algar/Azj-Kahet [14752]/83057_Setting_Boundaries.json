We cannot help Vi with his fear until Vi is actually safe.\n\nWhenever possible, I advocate friendship, recovery, and reconciliation. I ask others to act with compassion and empathy. Everyone deserves a chance to recover. I dedicate my life to this.\n\nBut hearing and seeing what is happening to Vi'azl... I think I've changed my mind. Enough is enough. We must act.",
