    "Description": "We don't have the firepower to dismantle their whole manufacturing operation, but what we do have is two leftover vials of anger pheromones. Let's make them count.\n\nThere's a siege marshal and a quartermaster overseeing the preparations and giving everyone orders. Logistics types, but they still pack a punch. That's where those pheromones come in.\n\nHit them with a vial, and their own armies will turn against them. Take out both, and we watch the operation crumble.",
