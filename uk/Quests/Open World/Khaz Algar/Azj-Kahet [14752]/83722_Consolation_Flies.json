    "Description": "Well... that's unfortunate.\n\nIt appears my experiment has failed and Siesbarg paid the price. Still, I am optimistic for the future I am destined to acquire. It's only a matter of time until I perfect my process. When I do, perhaps I shall engineer my own Ascension!\n\nWhile his physical form isn't what I intended, it appears Siesbarg's mind is intact. I'm certain he can still be of use. Take him. His new form can provide better service on the field of battle than in my tiny shop.",
