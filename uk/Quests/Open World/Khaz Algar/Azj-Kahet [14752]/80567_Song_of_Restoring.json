    "Description": "<Orweyna looks relieved at the sight of Hannan, but does not seem dissuaded from her task.>\n\nI cannot say I am surprised at what you found in that cave. Nerubians stuck in the Unseeming, trapped in a realm of monsters and madness...\n\nI would pity them, but they sought this out.\n\nYou, however, need to shift back before the influence of the Black Blood becomes too strong on your mind.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Use the Harmonizing Instrument.",
    "CompletionText": "It is a relief that the tuning crystal we found worked on this strange instrument. For once we should be grateful for the ingenuity of the nerubians.\n\nIf this device had not worked, we may have been stuck in the Unseeming forever. Like the nerubians in the cave.",
    "RewardText": "She can't keep running off like this! The rest of us followed her here--against our better judgement I might add--but we never agreed to...\n\n<Hannan sighs.>\n\nNo, we knew exactly what we were getting into with her. And the... consequences.",
