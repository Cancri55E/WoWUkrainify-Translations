    "Description": "Hm. This Anub'azal gave the orders that led to the prisoners' escape. Zev'kall here didn't seem very pleased with that.\n\nSo how about this--you sneak into Siegehold, and make best friends with Anub'azal.

I'd love to come with you, but I'd rather not tempt more Flynn stabbings today.",
