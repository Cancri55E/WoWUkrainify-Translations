    "Description": "Now that we've acquired enough chitin samples to splice into the perfect armor, we need the perfect venom. Don't look at me like that. Our forms should always be powerful and capable of defending themselves!\n\nI'll begin incorporating the new carapace requirements for Siesbarg's Ascension while you harvest what I need. Do keep in mind though, it must be nerubian venom, specifically. I'm afraid beetles and spiders simply won't do this time around. \n\nAs for where you find it, well that's up to you.",
