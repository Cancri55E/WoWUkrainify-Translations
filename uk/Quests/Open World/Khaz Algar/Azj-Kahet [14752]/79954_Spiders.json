    "Description": "Why, hello there, little $pr. You seem like you might be able to assist me.\n\nYou see, my dear mate Ami'thax fell onto a sharp dagger. Her body was taken to Pillar-nest Xesh, just below where we stand. Xesh is used to dispose of all sorts of bodies that we never speak of again.\n\nUnfortunately I have need to speak of Ami'thax, because she had the key to my new High Hollows burrow on her when she died. Dreadful timing, really. Would you go and fetch it? \n\nDo beware of the spiders, I need my key.",

    "RewardText": "I don't want to hear about where you found it, I have no need for the details.\n\nI am very excited to move into my High Hollows burrow!",
