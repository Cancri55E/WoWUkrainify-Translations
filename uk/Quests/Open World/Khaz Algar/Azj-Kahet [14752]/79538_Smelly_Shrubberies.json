    "Description": "Jenni here says she's got some creepers attackin' the goblins. I haven't seen any myself, but I do smell opportunity!\n\nWe've got our own anti-creeper perfume. It's the same recipe we use for the incense around town. Rub it on, and everything stays away! I'm sure we can sell some to the goblins.\n\nBut I'm out of materials--smellsage branches, specifically. If you gather some for me, I'll cut you in on the profits!",
