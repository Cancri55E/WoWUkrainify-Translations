    "Description": "One of my weave-rats has failed to check in for an unusually long time. I sent Spindle to retrieve information we could use against one of Ansurek's favored wretches, but she has not returned from her assignment.\n\nMeesk the Venomtongue is a wretch and a sycophant, but he is dangerous all the same. While I have much trust in my dera Spindle's abilities, I fear what a malefactor such as Meesk would do to one of my little ones should he find them.\n\nFind Spindle. Make sure she is well.",
