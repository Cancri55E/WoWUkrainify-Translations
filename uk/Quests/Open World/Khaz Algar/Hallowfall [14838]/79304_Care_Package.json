    "Description": "My cousin Sophietta and I came to Hallowfall together as stalwarts. Since arriving, we both lived here in Dunelle's Kindness for years. But she left last year to follow her dream of being one of our airship captains, or at least joining an airship crew.\n\nShe's a strong person, but I don't know how she's doing. Especially without Innkeeper Valrin's sweetrolls! She can't get them at Lightspark, the Sky Academy. Will you take these to her, and make sure she's doing alright?",
