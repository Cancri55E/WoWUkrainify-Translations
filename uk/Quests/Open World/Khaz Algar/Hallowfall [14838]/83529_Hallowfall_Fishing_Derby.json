    "Description": "Life is always on the edge here, $p. Nerubians, kobyss, hunger--there's always something ready to kill you.\n\nSo we need to find times to relax, and challenge ourselves at something other than survival. Like fishing.\n\nMy dad always spent Saturdays fishing, when I was growing up. He'd say, \"Take some time for yourself, or you can't be effective for others.\" \n\nSo every Saturday, I challenge people to the Hallowfall Fishing Derby. You have one hour to catch trophy fish. See what you can bring me!",
