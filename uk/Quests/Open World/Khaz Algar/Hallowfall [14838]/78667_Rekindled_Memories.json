    "Description": "Good people died here today, $p--a lot of them.\n\nEvery Arathi soldier carries a tinderbox. It represents their devotion to the Sacred Flame. Many use it as a focus to bring forth the Flame's light. In the dark places beyond the light of Beledar, the Sacred Flame brings hope.\n\nWith the nerubian attack, we can't recover their bodies. So we must retrieve these symbols, to venerate their sacrifice. Then use this torch to burn their bodies. It's the best funeral we can offer.",

    "CompletionText": "Have you recovered their tinderboxes? Every life deserves to be remembered in the Sacred Flame.",
