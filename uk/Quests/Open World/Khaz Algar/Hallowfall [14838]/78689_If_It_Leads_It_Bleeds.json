    "Description": "Everything rises and falls on leadership, $p. With a good leader, a unit can achieve almost anything. With a bad leader, chaos ensues and success moves out of reach. I've seen that first-hand.\n\nWithout leaders, the kobyss siege will break like a wave and everything else we do here becomes easier. I've seen three kobyss who seem to be leading the others--let me mark their locations on your map.\n\nDeal with them, and we'll be much more able to help Velhan's Claim.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Defeat the Kobyss leaders besieging Velhan's Claim.",
    "CompletionText": "Did you find their leaders? They look strong, but I'm sure you're up to the task.",
    "RewardText": "Excellent. That will put us and the kobyss on a more even footing. At least in terms of leadership.\n\nThey still outnumber us by a lot, but one thing at a time.",
