I don't know how to describe it better.\n\nMy idiot brother, Tomothy, was supposed to help me get rid of these, but I haven't seen him and I can't wait.\n\nClearly we don't want these to reproduce so I want you to cull as many as you can find, and then take their seeds. We'll burn those in holy fire to make sure we've cut off the infestation.",
