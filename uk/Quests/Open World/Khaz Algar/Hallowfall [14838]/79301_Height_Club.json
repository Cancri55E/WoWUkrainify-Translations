    "Description": "I'm so tired of Edwyn. From the day we all arrived, he's been telling everyone he'll be selected as captain.\n\nHe's a great flyer--very talented, and he knows his stuff. But his ego gets in the way of treating people as he should. And he knows my grades and flight review scores are higher.\n\nBut if I can't turn in my report, he'll be the next captain. Take it back from him!",
