    "Description": "I used to fish with my mother at the local pond when I was a child. It wasn't the fish that made the experience--my mother was famously terrible at cooking--but the tranquility and bonding time.\n\nPerhaps I could find a portion of that peace again here. There's a spot south of Mereldar that the others use to fish. I'll meet you there!",
