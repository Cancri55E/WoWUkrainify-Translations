    "Description": "I used to fish with my mother at the local pond when I was a child. It wasn't the fish that made the experience--my mother was famously terrible at cooking--but the tranquility and bonding time.\n\nPerhaps I could find a portion of that peace again here. There's a spot south of Mereldar that the others use to fish. I'll meet you there!",

    "RewardText": "I wish we could have fished. But if today confirmed anything to me, I have relearned a valuable truth.\n\nIf I lay down my sword, these children would have to pick them up if they are to survive this place. They have known no other place than this land.\n\nThey will see our homeland. They must see our homeland.",
