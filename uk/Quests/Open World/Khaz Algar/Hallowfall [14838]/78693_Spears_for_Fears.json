    "Description": "It seems Velhan and his followers hoped they could live in peace here. They were so sure they could, in fact, that they didn't bring any weapons with them.\n\nThis is a problem, with the kobyss attacking now, but the kobyss can actually solve it for us. They've brought plenty of spears for their siege on Velhan's Claim, and a spear will skewer a kobyss just as well as a human.\n\nHead out there and gather some spears for the people, $p, and they won't have to be so afraid.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Gather 8 Kobyss Spears for the people of Velhan's Claim.",
    "CompletionText": "Kobyss giving you trouble? Soon, the people of Velhan's Claim will be the ones giving them trouble.",
    "RewardText": "Good work, $n, this is exactly what we need to not just drive the kobyss back today, but to make sure the people of Velhan's Claim can defend themselves in the future.",
