    "Title": "Cage, Match",
    "Description": "When we were scouting before you arrived, we saw a lot of cages set up around Velhan's Claim. Typically, the kobyss use these to hold their victims until they're needed for a ritual sacrifice.\n\nThose sacrifices lead to... lots of other dark activities. Not the least of which is eating the victims.\n\nLet's get ahead of all that. Take my torch, and destroy the cages, so we don't have to see that happen to anyone from Velhan's Claim.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Burn 10 kobyss cages with Aemyra's Holy Flame.",
    "CompletionText": "Have you dealt with those cages yet? The citizens of Velhan's Claim won't be safe until you do.",
    "RewardText": "Good work, $n. Without their cages, the kobyss won't be able to take prisoners.\n\nNo prisoners means no foul rituals, and preventing those gives us a much better chance of saving the people at Velhan's Claim.",
