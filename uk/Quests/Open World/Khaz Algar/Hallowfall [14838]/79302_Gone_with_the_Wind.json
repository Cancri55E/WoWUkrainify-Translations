    "Description": "I can't believe Edwyn threw my report out into the wind. \n\nCan you please track down what papers you can find? I'll look for any around the school grounds, you check the valley. \n\nThis report is already late... But I had some really good insights around airship capabilities. When Headmaster Fynch sees them, maybe he'll still allow me to turn it in.\n\nBring me whatever pages you find!",
