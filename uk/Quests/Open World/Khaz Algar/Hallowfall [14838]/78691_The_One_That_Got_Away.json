    "Description": "$p, my son is out with the kobyss. He convinced the other kids they should sneak out with him to fight. Said they should, \"be brave like my dad\". \n\nWhen they met a kobyss, the others all ran back here, while he ran toward the crashed ship, to lead it away.\n\nI have not handled myself bravely, $p. The story of the Indomitable says I was a hero; those lies were my report. \n\nIf there was ever a time to step up, it's now. But I'm no match for the kobyss alone. Come with me, $p--help me save Maximillian.",

I've seen there are outcomes worse than death. \n\nI can't undo the mistakes I've made in the past, but I can be certain not to repeat the pattern.",
