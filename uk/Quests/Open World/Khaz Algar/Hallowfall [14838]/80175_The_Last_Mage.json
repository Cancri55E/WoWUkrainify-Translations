    "Description": "I want you to check in on someone. He's a mage... the only one of us who is. All the others died in the crash.\n\nHe's trying to make a portal to the Empire, so we can get reinforcements and have a way to and from home. \n\nWe all know it's a lost cause, but he still hasn't given up. \n\nMaybe meeting a seasoned traveler like you will give him the reality check he needs. Check on him, will you?",
