    "Description": "It is our custom to pay homage to the fallen by burning whatever we can recover of their belongings. Usually, it is their tinderboxes as those are easier to carry. We then return those items to the flame.\n\nWhile we were able to retrieve Sir Ashrealm's tinderbox, Ryton's breastplate will serve to honor his memory.\n\nYou have placed your life in danger not only for me, but also for Hallowfall. I would be honored if you would assist me this one last time in remembering our fallen.",

    "CompletionText": "Thank you, $n.",
    "RewardText": "It is done. It feels both odd and somehow comforting to finally know my dear friend's fate with certainty.\n\nThank you for everything, $n.",
