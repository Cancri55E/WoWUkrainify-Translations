    "Description": "Poor Theleon. I gave him some of his first lessons in combat. I'll see him to his final pyre.\n\nBut first, you. \n\n I've been trying to fight back an infestation of Sweet-stings harassing our wine-making operations. I need someone else to finish them off while I tend to Theleon's remains.\n\nBe fast and clever and bring me some of their venom as you take care of things. We'll turn that into a poison for the nesting sites and be done with the nuisance.",
