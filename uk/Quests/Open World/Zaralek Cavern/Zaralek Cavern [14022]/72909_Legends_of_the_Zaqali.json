    "Description": "Because of our recent conflicts, I have been researching the djaradin. Our archives had little information on their elders.\n\nLegends say that they were once great warlords who now slumber beneath the earth. The djaradin believe they will awaken and lead them to a brutal victory against the dragonflights.\n\nWe need to know what we are up against. There is an empty shrine just below us that resembles the ones housing the elders. \n\nWe may find some answers there.",
