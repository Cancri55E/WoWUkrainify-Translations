    "Description": "Look closely, $n. You see this odd chunk of metal in the deepflayer muck?\n\nI have felt my head swimming since we arrived in these caverns. I thought it was just the ceaseless prattling of our whelp, Wrathion, but this object here may prove otherwise.\n\nI will continue my efforts to unlock this relic's secrets. Seek out similar pieces in the nearby caves. A dark theory is emerging, though we will need more information before I am willing to confirm it.",
