    "Description": "It troubles me that Dezran would sacrifice himself so willingly for Sarkareth... And that Amythora and Marithos would leave Dezran to save him.\n\nWe both know the loss of waking in a new world. But Sarkareth wallows in the darkness of our past. I cannot let him continue to recruit our people.\n\nSarkareth awaits in the next room. I do not wish to kill him, but we must bring him to justice.\n\nLet me know when you are ready.",
