    "Description": "Perisimona told me about her life-mate, Tuberros, and what she knows about his disappearance.\n\nTuberros was guiding a client from the Dragonscale Expedition around some ruins here. It sounds as though they may have run into the Sundered Flame.\n\nI would rather not go after the Sundered Flame myself. Doing so would announce my presence to Sarkareth. \n\nWill you aid us by finding and rescuing Tuberros and his client? Maybe then he can help guide us to Neltharion's vault.",
