    "Description": "Some of our incense needs to be burned very slowly to release the right aromas. You can check the heat yourself, of course--but it gets to be a bother.\n\nFortunately, I've found a solution! If you grind up shards of fire elementals and sprinkle the dust over the incense, you can keep the heat consistent using enchantments. Completely hands-free!\n\nThose shards are a bit hard to come by, though. Could you find some and bring them to my friends back in Loamm?",
