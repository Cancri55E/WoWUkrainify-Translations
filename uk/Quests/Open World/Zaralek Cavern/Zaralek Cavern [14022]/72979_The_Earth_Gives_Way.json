That is Honeypelt's home, which she offered us respite at while you were still in the cave.\n\nI would only ask that you check on Wrathion. He may be a ceaselessly buzzing pest, yes, but... these recent events force me to admit I care for his well-being too.  \n\nThere are only so many black dragons left. We must look out for each other.",
