    "Description": "The shadowflame has already corrupted Fyrakk irreparably. Every place in Zaralek darkened by his wings has been lit ablaze with shadowflame.\n\nWe cannot leave it behind and let it fester--it will need to be extinguished while it is still kindling, lest we allow its corruption to take root.\n\n<Ebyssian coughs, then winces.>\n\nSabellian and I cannot take to the air in this state. Disperse the flames with your drake. We will follow you below and meet you back at Loamm.",
