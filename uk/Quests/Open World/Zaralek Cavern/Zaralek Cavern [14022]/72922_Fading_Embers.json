    "Description": "This is a difficult situation, my friend. Wounds and insecurities cannot be easily dismissed. Only time--and cooperation--can soothe the sting born of longstanding rivalries.\n\nBut there are more urgent matters to address. If there is a large force of drakonids still loyal to the memory of Neltharion, this land is much more dangerous than any of us expected.\n\nEmberthal still pursues Sarkareth--alone. She must be made aware of the threats that surround her. We must find her and give her aid.",
