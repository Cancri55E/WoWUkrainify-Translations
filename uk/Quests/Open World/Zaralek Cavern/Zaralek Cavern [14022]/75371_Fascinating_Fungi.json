Miss Mistie has asked for help gathering them for her alchemical experiments.\n\nShe says the Gelcap mushrooms produce sticky spores that she can make into a balm, good for easing achy joints and bunions! I sure could use some after standing around on these hard stones all day!\n\nIf you can find her some, I'm sure she will make it worth your while!",
