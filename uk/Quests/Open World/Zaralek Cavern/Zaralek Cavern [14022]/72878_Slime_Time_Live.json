    "Description": "$p, if I could grab your ear again, my dear?\n\nSince making it back to Loamm, I've noticed that some of our incense pots have gone missing.\n\nIncense is what we use to mark our trade routes, and find our way back to Loamm. It's very important that we replace the missing incense as soon as possible.\n\nBy the way, we make our incense from snail slime, so you're going to have to wrangle some snails first!\n\nOnce you're done, Citros can help you out with the rest.\n\nSay hello to Marie Shellie for me!",
