    "Description": "Why, I just got another letter from my good friend Mistie. She's been looking for interesting ingredient ideas for her smelly concoctions!\n\nA while ago, the kithguards took down a deepflayer near Loamm. I noticed a peculiar dust it shed when it perished. It had a unique aroma to it, and I'm sure Mistie would love to experiment with something like that!\n\nCould you gather some from the deepflayers near Loamm, then bring it to Miss Mistie? You'll be doing us a favor, too!",
