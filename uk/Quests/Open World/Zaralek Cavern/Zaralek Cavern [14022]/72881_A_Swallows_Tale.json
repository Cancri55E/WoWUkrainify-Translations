    "Description": "Uplander!\n\nI'm Effervesta, Lady Redolence to the niffen of Loamm--the daughter of their leader. No need for formalities though, you can just call me Effie!\n\nKeep this between you and me, but we're a bit behind on some shipments to Glimmerogg, and the Drogbar are definitely not happy one bit! You've already been so helpful to Elder Honeypelt... maybe you can give me a hand too?\n\nOur swallows keeper, Nevroll, might be able to dig up some dirt on the issue. \n\nWill you go talk to him, please?",
