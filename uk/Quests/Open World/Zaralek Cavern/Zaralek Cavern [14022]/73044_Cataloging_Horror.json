    "Description": "I... I need to bring the evidence of this insanity back to my flight. It may destroy us, but my people need to know what happened here. \n\nI borrowed some cataloging cameras from Tellywin. Can you join me in documenting these atrocities?\n\nI can provide you with a similar protection to that which I gave in the vault. I will leave any fighting to you; I cannot bring myself to cause any more suffering than my flight has already wrought. \n\nLet us be done with this as swiftly as possible.",
