    "Description": "Hmm. You ever mount a snail before?\n\nI've trained generations of racing snail champions, but now I've come across my toughest case yet. Problem is he's too crokin' big. Straight up barred from competition.\n\nIt's a shame to keep such a prize specimen stuck in a bucket though. If you can help me train Slick up to be the speedster I know he is, we'll call him yours!",
