    "Description": "I've heard tales that the djaradin forge their blades with magic so hot that they can actually quench the metal with lava. Lava! It's like ice water compared to the heat their magic creates! \n\nBut I've never been able to verify it for myself. They aren't exactly peddling their wares at the market.\n\nYou smell like battle, though. Go and fetch some of their weapons for the blacksmiths back in Loamm and we'll see if the legends are true, eh?",
