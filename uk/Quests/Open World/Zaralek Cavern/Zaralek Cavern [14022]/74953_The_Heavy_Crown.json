    "Description": "I was really down when Effervesta didn't come like she said she would.\n\nBut I understand that she's so busy, what with being kidnapped and all of her duties. I don't blame her.\n\nI want to tell her how much that time meant to me when we were pups, though. That I'll be here for her if she ever needs me. Then at least she knows I'm still here.\n\nCan you help me get her attention long enough to say what I need to?",
