    "Description": "Up ahead, the Primalists are working to awaken the Zaqali's final elder.\n\nWhen we used the farsight totem earlier, I observed that they were draining something from the elder. Now I realize it is likely an attempt to dispel the magic keeping the elder in stasis. They are using elemental cores to contain the magic in the same way we did to cleanse Sabellian.\n\nFyrakk absorbing shadowflame is disastrous. We cannot add an elder awakening to that threat. We must halt their efforts.",
