    "Description": "The Primalists have a sizeable force of djaradin guarding them while they complete their work.\n\nEven in small numbers, djaradin prove to be formidable opponents when allowed to engage in battle on their own terms. It is far better to bring the fight to them, leaving as little time to react as possible.\n\nTake them out. We cannot have them encroaching on the space we have managed to carve out thus far.",
