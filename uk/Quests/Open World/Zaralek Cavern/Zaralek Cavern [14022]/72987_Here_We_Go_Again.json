    "Description": "I understand Alexstrasza's concerns. Shadowflame is a vile force that poses an indescribable threat to anyone who comes close to it, as we have personally witnessed. Unfortunately, Aberrus may contain even more threats.\n\nWe need to continue to push forward.\n\nBefore I left Zaralek Cavern, I made contact with soldiers stationed by Neltharion at the Obsidian Rest. Luckily for us, they remain loyal to the Black Dragonflight. \n\nLet us meet there.",
