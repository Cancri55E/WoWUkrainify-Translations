Or has Fyrakk fallen to the temptation?\n\nOnly ignorance or arrogance tempts fools to seek it out, believing they can master dark forces that not even Neltharion could. It infected him, slowly, like a gangrenous lesion until finally he succumbed to madness.\n\nSo too will Fyrakk.\n\nI will not take that risk with Sabellian. \n\nHe was burned badly before I was able to fly you to safety. Let us assess the extent of the damage.",
