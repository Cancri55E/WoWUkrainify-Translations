    "Description": "When the nerubians launched their attack on my meadery, they left it a burnt-out husk. Adelgonn promised to rebuild it, but I got impatient and accepted the Venture Co.'s offer to help with its \"restructuring.\" \n\nBut now, it's clear they had their own agenda. Blasted goblins have taken over, and they're driving the place into the ground. They've ramped up production to unsafe levels, pushing the cinderbees and our equipment to their limits.\n\nPlease help fix this, $n.",
