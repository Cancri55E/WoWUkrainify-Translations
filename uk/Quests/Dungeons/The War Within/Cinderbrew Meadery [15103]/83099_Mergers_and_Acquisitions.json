    "Description": "When the nerubians launched their attack on my meadery, they left it a burnt-out husk. Adelgonn promised to rebuild it, but I got impatient and accepted the Venture Co.'s offer to help with its \"restructuring.\" \n\nBut now, it's clear they had their own agenda. Blasted goblins have taken over, and they're driving the place into the ground. They've ramped up production to unsafe levels, pushing the cinderbees and our equipment to their limits.\n\nPlease help fix this, $n.",

    "RewardText": "A heartfelt thank you for what you did at the Cinderbrew Meadery. \n\nDriving away Venture Co. was no small feat, but thanks to you, we've reclaimed our beloved meadery and will resume making cinderbrew the right way--the way we've made it for centuries.",
