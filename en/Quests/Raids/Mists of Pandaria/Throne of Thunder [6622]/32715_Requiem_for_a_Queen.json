    "Description": "A chilling breeze sweeps across your body, bringing with it a haunting drape of sadness. Your soul sinks as you hear the faint, melodic cries of Monara, the last Queen of the Mogu.\n\nHer sweet requiem creeps through the air, bending and shaping itself into a spectral hand, reaching for your heart. As it grabs hold, you see a brief flash of Monara's last moments... her brutal murder by the hand of Lei Shen.\n\nSong turns to sadness and Monara weeps, wailing louder and louder into the darkness.",
