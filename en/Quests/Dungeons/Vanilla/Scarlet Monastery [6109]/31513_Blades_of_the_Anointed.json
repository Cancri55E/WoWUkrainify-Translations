    "Description": "The problem with the Scarlet Crusade is that they keep coming back, even after death.\n\nBehind those resurrections is High Inquisitor Whitemane. With her death, so goes the Crusade.\n\nTo give her the final rest, we need two swords of legend, each with a lost but storied history.\n\nLuckily for me... er, us, these two blades of the anointed are at rest here within the monastery.\n\nFind them and once you've killed Whitemane, plunge the blades into her corpse to make the death permanent.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect the two Blades of the Anointed.",
    "CompletionText": "<With one blade already in your possession, you move to take the other.>\n\n<An inscription on the statue behind the sword reads, \"The Hand of Providence\".>",
    "RewardText": "<The second anointed blade floats just in front of the wet statue. Steam rises from the sword.>\n\n<You get the uncanny feeling that the Hand of Providence has been waiting for you.>",
