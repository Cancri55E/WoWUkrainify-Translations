    "Description": "There is a book of great value to me here in the halls.\n\nUnfortunately, it's in the possession of Flameweaver Koegler. I've tried to get close to him before, but it's never quite worked out.\n\nYou might have better luck. Just watch out -- I hear that he's gone well and truly insane. The Flameweaver plans to burn every tome they have in the library.\n\nHe'll probably burn the Scarlet Halls down in the process.",

    "RewardText": "Ah yes!\n\n<The Hooded Crusader rubs her hands together gleefully at the sight of the codex.>\n\nAnd now, I have a checklist with the name of every Scarlet Crusader on it!\n\nYou know... just in case any of them are unaccounted for. I don't like loose ends.",
