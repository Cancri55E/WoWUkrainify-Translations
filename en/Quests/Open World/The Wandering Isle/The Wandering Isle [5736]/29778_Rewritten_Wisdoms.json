    "Description": "$n, we must help Elder Shaopai. There are few more deserving of our kindness.\n\nOn the way here, you surely noticed the scrolls of wisdom hanging in the grotto to the south. The hozen have defiled many of them, and sadly, they are not recoverable. We will deal with the problem directly - burn the defiled scrolls. Wipe the hozen writings away entirely.\n\nDo not worry for Elder Shaopai. The people shall come together and help him rewrite the wisdoms in time. I shall see to that.",
