When fighting is needed, we will not hesitate, but when fighting is not needed, neither do we instigate. However, the direct solution is often cutting the head off the snake, as they say.\n\nThe hozen have a leader instigating these attacks. If we remove Ruk-Ruk, we won't have to wipe the hozen out entirely.\n\nI know you are not of the Huojin, but are you with me in what must be done, $n?",
