His spirit now rests with the ancestors.\n\nNow we must look to a new leader for our order, our broken temple. I have spoken with the other masters and we are all of one mind on this.\n\nWe all agree that new leader should be you, $n. You have shown strength, wisdom, courage, and kindness beyond measure.\n\nWalk with us to the temple and we will announce our decision.",
