    "Description": "I haven't spoken with Azeroth for years. At first I just didn't feel the need. Then I realized I had started to resent her. For leaving me like... this. And now I'm not sure if I can.\n\nBut I know the stakes. This Radiant Song of hers foretells something dire. And we need to know what.\n\nFirst, we need to prepare the Heart Chamber. Can ye start up the consoles nearby?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Help Magni perform his ritual.",

    "RewardText": "This has never happened before. Magni is the Speaker of Azeroth. Why would communing with her cause him to collapse?",
