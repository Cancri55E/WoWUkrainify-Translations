    "Description": "I have always hoped that mages would once again walk the streets of Theramore. This, however, is not what I had in mind.\n\nIf this Sullied Banner truly intends to reconstruct a working mana bomb, then they must be stopped--but I will not repeat the mistakes Malygos made. There must be a way to reason with them. \n\nI shall place an enchantment upon you that will allow you to subdue the mages without killing them. See to it that they cannot continue their ill-intended actions.",
