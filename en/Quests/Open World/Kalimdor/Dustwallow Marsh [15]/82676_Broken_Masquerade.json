    "Description": "I cannot remember how I arrived at this swamp, but it was great luck that I did. As I wandered, I spotted Lady Katrana Prestor entering a strange toothy cave. Now, what would a noblewoman be doing in such a ghoulish place?\n\nFollowing her closely, I found a great clutch of black dragon eggs within the lair. Such evidence is clear. Katrana is Lady Onyxia! \n\nI beg of you, aid me in defeating this vile dragon once and for all.",
