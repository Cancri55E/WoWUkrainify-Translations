    "Description": "Raszageth has wasted no time building up her Primalist forces.\n\nThe Kirin Tor have detected massive storms being unleashed at key points across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms.\n\nThe Primalists are unleashing the elements to add to their strength. It seems they plan to cause chaos not only in the Dragon Isles, but in the lands of the Alliance and Horde as well.\n\nSeek out the enemy and study their methods. We have to stop them before it's too late.",
