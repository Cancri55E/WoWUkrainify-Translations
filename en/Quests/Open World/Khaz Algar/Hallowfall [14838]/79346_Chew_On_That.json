    "Description": "Fishing out here is not easy, especially when the spooky sounds of the darkness start to wear on the nerves.\n\nI've taken to chewing on the Duskstem from the tall plants nearby. It's sweet and chewy, keeps the jaw busy, and helps me pass the time!\n\nIf you could lend a hand by gathering some Duskstem with your flying mount, I would be most appreciative.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 20 Duskstem from the tallest plants that grow in the darkness.",
    "CompletionText": "Have you collected enough?",
    "RewardText": "You made that look easy. It usually takes me an hour to climb one of those plants.",
