I thought she'd be back from her last mission, to Velhan's Claim, by now.\n\nCould you go make sure she's okay, and deliver this message? I'm worried to the point of distraction.\n\nMaybe you could also pick some of her favorite flowers, up that hill? \n\nI'd go myself, but if I can get ELIZA working right, it would do so much to feed people in Hallowfall. And give me more time to spend with Aemyra, too!",
