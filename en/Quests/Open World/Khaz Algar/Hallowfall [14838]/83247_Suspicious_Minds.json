    "Description": "For many years, the only non-Arathi we ever saw in Hallowfall were trying to kill us. Nerubians, shadow creatures, beasts. So, forgive me if I view your sudden arrival with suspicion.\n\nHowever, my better half would urge me to be more welcoming... and I want to try to be better. For her.\n\nSome of the salamanthers in Rumshackle have been bothering us. Kill them and bring me proof.",
