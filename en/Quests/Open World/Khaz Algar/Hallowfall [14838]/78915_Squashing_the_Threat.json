They're stinky and crawling with nasty mites.\n\nMom and Dad brought in some airships to help us yank them out, but it's risky business with all those bugs.\n\nCan you attach ropes to these Shadow-Soured Squash, and the airships can then haul them away without making a mess?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Remove 8 Shadow-Sour Squash and slay 10 Shadow-Sour Mites.",
    "RewardText": "You did it! I heard stories of one time the squash was so heavy the airship crashed! Glad that didn't happen.",
