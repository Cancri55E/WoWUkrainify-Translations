That may not seem like a large issue to you, but the Arathi in Hallowfall survive only because we follow orders and stand for our brethren.\n\nI am not cruel. I do not want to punish a man for his weakness in this terrible environment. Can you find him and bring him back? \n\nTake all the time you need.",
