    "Description": "$p, the people of Velhan's Claim have been locked up inside, afraid of the dark, for too long. \n\nAnd there's plenty to fear out there, but these are capable, strong people. They should be driving the kobyss away, not hiding behind their walls. \n\nGet these spears to the people of Velhan's Claim. They've learned to hide from their problems, but we'll give them the means to take their lives back!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Distribute 8 spears to the residents of Velhan's Claim.",
    "CompletionText": "Have you handed out those spears yet? The people need them to remind them what they're capable of.",
    "RewardText": "I think now we'll see them acting very differently, now that they're armed, $n.\n\nThere's something about knowing you can take care of yourself, that you can handle your own problems, and you don't need anyone to rescue you.\n\nOf course, we Lamplighters will always be there to help, but it's very likely that we won't be needed next time.",
