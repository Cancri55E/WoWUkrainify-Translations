    "Description": "The problem I see, $p, is the kobyss. There's just so many of them.\n\nEveryone here was serving in the Empire's military when we arrived in Hallowfall. They may be rusty now, but they've all trained before, and know how to be dangerous.\n\nBut we need to eliminate every disadvantage, including the kobyss numbers. So head out there and even up the numbers. Aemyra and I will keep everyone safe here.",
