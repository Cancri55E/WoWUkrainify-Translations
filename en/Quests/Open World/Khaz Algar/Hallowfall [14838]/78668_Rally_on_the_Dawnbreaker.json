    "Title": "Rally on the Dawnbreaker",
    "Description": "It's critical, with so many nerubians pouring through the Aegis Wall, that we defend our airships docked at Tenir's Ascent.\n\nThe nerubians have always outnumbered us, but our fleet allows us to concentrate our defenders where they are attacking, as well as allowing us to bombard them from the safety of the skies.\n\nIf we lose our armada, our hopes fade dramatically. Meet us there when you can.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Meet Faerin at Tenir's Ascent aboard the Dawnbreaker.",
    "RewardText": "I'm glad you're with us, $n. \n\nWithout our airships, we have little chance of holding back the nerubians in the long run. \n\nTo say nothing of our dockworkers, who are safe below deck.\n\nLet's see to the defense.",
