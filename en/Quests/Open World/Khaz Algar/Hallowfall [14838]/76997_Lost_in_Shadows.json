I find myself in a dire situation. \n\nSome fresh recruits and I were on patrol in these lands when our torches went out, leaving us utterly lost and disoriented.\n\nI found safety in this house, but most of the recruits fled, confused into the darkness. \n\nWill you help me locate them? I have a spare Patrol Torch. The mere sight of it should rally them to your side.",
