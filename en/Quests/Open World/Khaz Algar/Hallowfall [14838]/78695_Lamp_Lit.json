    "Title": "Lamp Lit",
    "Description": "The kobyss normally live deep underwater, $p. When Beledar is at its brightest, they don't bother us. Other sources of bright light will usually keep them away, but definitely weaken them.\n\nAs Lamplighters, we not only go into the dark to protect those in need, but we provide them the light that will keep them safe. Go set up these torches along the perimeter, then meet us up at the dawntower behind Velhan's Claim.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Place 8 torches around the perimeter of Velhan's Claim, then observe the re-lighting of the dawntower.",
    "CompletionText": "Did you get those torches set, $n? The people will be able to quickly light them whenever Beledar fades.",
    "RewardText": "You saved my son, $n. You broke the spine of the attack on our home, gave us what we need to fight. \n\nYou helped me to be the leader I'd pretended I was. Thank you.\n\nThe Lamplighters will always have allies in Velhan's Claim.",
