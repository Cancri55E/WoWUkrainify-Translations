    "Description": "Maevest and I broke away from the others and fled, their screams left in our wake. Foul muck smothered our lanterns and we stumbled in the dark through knee-high waters. I heard a splash like she had tripped and fallen in, but I couldn't bring myself to look back.\n\nOnly later did I find the tiny bite marks on my ankles. Be warned, there's something in the water.\n\nI took notice of fronds growing from the pools. Swarming insects feast on their sickly nectar. Destroy those plants and starve the beasts.",

    "CompletionText": "Stay out of the water if you can help it. If they latch onto you, those swarming insects can be shaken free with a few good jumps.",
    "RewardText": "<Scout Wayshelm gives you an approving nod and finds a grim smile.>\n\nIn the dark, even the plants want us dead.",
