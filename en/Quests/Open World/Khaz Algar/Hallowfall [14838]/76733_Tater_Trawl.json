    "Description": "Harvesting in this area has become a challenge, with crazed Harvesters destroying most of our crops. There are potatoes to be found if you look closely.\n\nIf you light the harvest torches, you might uncover some potatoes hiding in the shadows. \n\nUsing those lights, gather as many potatoes as you can. Every bit helps in these trying times.",
