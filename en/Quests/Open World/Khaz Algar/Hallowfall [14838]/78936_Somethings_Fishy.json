    "Description": "So you outsiders and Faerin managed to both survive and save the villagers at the beach? \n\n<Steelstrike breathes a quick prayer in relief.> \n\nWe're in trouble, here. The kobyss brought some of their strongest forces to the doorsteps of villagers. \n\nWe have our hands full just holding the line. If you can take out those monsters, we might be able to turn the tide.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Slay Deepsludger, The Abominable Wavecrasher, and Tidelord Teethwretch in Sina's Yearning.",
    "CompletionText": "When we first encountered the kobyss, there were those among us who tried to establish peace with them. But it quickly became apparent that they only see us as food.",
    "RewardText": "Every Arathi has killed more kobyss than I care to count. We've also lost more Arathi to kobyss than I want to count. \n\nI don't know what underwater cavern they hail from... but I shudder to think of it.",
