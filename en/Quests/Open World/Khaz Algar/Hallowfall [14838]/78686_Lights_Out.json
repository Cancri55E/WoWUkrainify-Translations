    "Description": "Name's Aegor. I try to keep tabs on Lamplighters in the field and assess what areas of Hallowfall may be in need of their aid.\n\nThe dawntower fell dark at Velhan's Claim a few weeks ago. Based on what's been happening around Hallowfall, it's probably because of the rising tide of kobyss.\n\nLamplighters Taenar and Aemyra are heading there, but this might be more than even two Lamplighters together can handle. Will you meet them there and help them restore the light at Velhan's Claim?",
