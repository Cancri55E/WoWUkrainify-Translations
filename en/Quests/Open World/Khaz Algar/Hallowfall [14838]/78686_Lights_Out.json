    "Description": "Name's Aegor. I try to keep tabs on Lamplighters in the field and assess what areas of Hallowfall may be in need of their aid.\n\nThe dawntower fell dark at Velhan's Claim a few weeks ago. Based on what's been happening around Hallowfall, it's probably because of the rising tide of kobyss.\n\nLamplighters Taenar and Aemyra are heading there, but this might be more than even two Lamplighters together can handle. Will you meet them there and help them restore the light at Velhan's Claim?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Meet Taenar and Aemyra near Velhan's Claim.",
    "RewardText": "Pleased to meet you, $n. I'm Taenar, and this is Aemyra.\n\nThe dawntower at Velhan's Claim went dark a while ago, and with all that's been happening, we're only just getting here to help.\n\nWe did some scouting, and it seems the area is overrun with kobyss. I imagine Velhan's holed up inside, instead of fighting them off.\n\nGood thing for his people that we're here. And it's better still to have you along helping.",
