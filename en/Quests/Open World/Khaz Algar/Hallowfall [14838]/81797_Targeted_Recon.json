    "Title": "Targeted Recon",
    "Description": "If you've spent much time in Hallowfall, no doubt by now you've run across the foul magic of the kobyss. Reports that their illusions have been evolving are fiercely debated within the Arathi Army.\n\nYour outside perspective is just what I'm looking for. Venture to the Sunless Strand, slay a few of their illusory assassins, and then report your findings. You'll likely find them hiding in the shadows.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Slay three Kobyss Shadeshapers in Sunless Strand.",
    "RewardText": "Their illusory projections of Arathi civilians sound convincing as ever. I struggle to understand how such vicious and undiplomatic creatures can emulate Arathi mannerisms so well.\n\nNonetheless, this is all in line with our current understanding of the kobyss. Your report shall be put to good use. Thank you, outsider.",
