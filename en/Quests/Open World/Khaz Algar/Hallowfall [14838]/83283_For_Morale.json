    "Description": "Please excuse my husband's rudeness. When we signed up for our expedition, we expected to be away from our families for a few years at worst. Instead, we settled here as we guard against--well, against the end, against Renilash. Who knows when our watch will end?\n\nI've been stockpiling a cache of wine from our church vineyards to share with everyone when tensions got high. My hiding place, Rumshackle, has been overrun by creatures. Can you get the wine for me?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Retrieve 6 barrels of Imperial Brut from Rumshackle.",
    "CompletionText": "Imagine twenty Arathi huddling under the safety of a single light for ten years. Imagine they're waiting for a chance to let their hair down with a good drink with their comrades.\n\nNow imagine how they'll feel once they hear the wine is gone.\n\n...please hurry.",
    "RewardText": "Oh, thank the Flame.\n\nYou've prevented a small riot from forming. Bless you, bless you, bless you!",
