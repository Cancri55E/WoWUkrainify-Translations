    "Description": "Greetings, $p, name's Orren. We've got a whole mess of Jawcrawlers that came up from underground attacking the crops. Something a $c like yourself could really help out with!\n\nHunger is never far away in Hallowfall, so saving these crops is my priority.\n\nBut if you'd be willing to drive them off for me, I'll be able to focus on my long-term plan to feed people more effectively.\n\nMeet me over by the shed! And bring any food that's not too chewed up.",

    "CompletionText": "This'll keep our crops safe in the future. And perhaps the leftovers can go... in a stew.",
    "RewardText": "Good work, $n, that looks... edible. And when you're on the wall, worried about nerubians killing you, I doubt anyone will mind. \n\nI was able to get a lot of ELIZA's decision sprockets properly aligned while you were doing that, so thanks!",
