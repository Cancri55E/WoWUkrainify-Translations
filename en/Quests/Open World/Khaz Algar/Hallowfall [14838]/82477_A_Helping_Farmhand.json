Something a $c like yourself could really help out with!\n\nHunger is never far away in Hallowfall, so saving these crops is my priority.\n\nBut if you'd be willing to drive them off for me, I'll be able to focus on my long-term plan to feed people more effectively.\n\nMeet me over by the shed! And bring any food that's not too chewed up.",
