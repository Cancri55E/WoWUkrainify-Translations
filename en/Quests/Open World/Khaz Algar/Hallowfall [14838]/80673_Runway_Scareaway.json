    "Description": "'Lo there.\n\nMe and Mags are generally in charge of clearing the sky in this area during our Lamplighting route. If we don't cull the moths in the area, they start spreading up towards the skydocks and start laying eggs in the machinery of our ships.\n\nUnfortunately we're not as spry as we used to be.
