    "Description": "$p, I need your help. My whole future is on the line! I came to Lightspark to be an airship captain, and I've put in a ton of work to excel here. But my notebook is missing, with my final report!\n\nI'm top in the class, but if I don't turn it in soon, I won't be our next airship captain. Please help me find it.\n\nI thought I left it out by the canyon where we review each other's skiff piloting, but it wasn't there when I checked. Can you help me look for it?",
