    "Description": "Great work gathering these up. I found a few blowing around up here, so I think we've got all the pages. Let's get this to Headmaster Fynch! He's probably in the classroom.\n\nI sure hope he accepts it. He says he doesn't accept late work, but there were a lot of extenuating circumstances at play here. And if he doesn't, I'll be reporting to Edwyn as my captain. I'm not sure I could do that, after what's happened.",

    "RewardText": "Sophietta has been a phenomenal student. Honestly, I am too close to the situation to make that decision without bias. But it was too nuanced to reject without consideration.\n\nAs an outsider, I know your decision wasn't colored by months spent with these students, so I could trust your judgment. I appreciate your help in resolving the situation, $n.",
