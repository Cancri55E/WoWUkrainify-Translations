    "Description": "Many in Hallowfall will call you \"outsider\". I would call you friend. I would also ask for your help, if you are no stranger to combat. Desperate times forge strong friendships.\n\nGeneral Steelstrike ordered the army to fall back from the nerubian onslaught. In doing so, she abandoned a Lamplighter and many troops to the darkness. I may not be able to save them on my own, but with your help I may succeed.\n\nIf you're willing, ride with me or meet me there.",
