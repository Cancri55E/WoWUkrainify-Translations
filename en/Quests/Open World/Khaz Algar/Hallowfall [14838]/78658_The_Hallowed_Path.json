    "Description": "$p, I'm glad our paths have crossed. Adelgonn has been telling me about a cavern called Hallowfall.\n\nShe's told me the people there are called the Arathi. I cannot imagine that they are related to the ancient human kingdom, but it can't be a coincidence.\n\nAdelgonn's people had fruitful contact with them some time ago. Whatever happened, I hope to repair that relationship and gain their aid. Please meet me at the Hallowfall Gate.",
