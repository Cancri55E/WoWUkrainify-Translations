    "Description": "A lot of things went wrong when the Indomitable crashed, $p. But the most upsetting one is that--when the order was finally given to make our way back to Mereldar, we couldn't honor our fallen comrades.\n\nIt seems the kobyss reanimated our fallen stalwarts, who now wander the Indomitable in a ghastly skeletal form.\n\nTake back their tinderboxes. If we can deliver those to the Sacred Flame, they'll finally be free after all these years.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Retrieve 4 Recovered Tinderboxes from the Indomitable's stalwarts.",
    "CompletionText": "Did you find those tinderboxes, $n?",
    "RewardText": "The flame burns for us all, $n. I wish I could have saved them that night, but I'm glad we'll be able to honor their memories.\n\nIt's what we all would want, if it happened to us.",
