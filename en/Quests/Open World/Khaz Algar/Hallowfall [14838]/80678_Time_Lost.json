    "Description": "Now that the job's done -- one thing I've always done on this route is muck around for some of the valuables that fall from the docks. As things get moved onto ships small items can fall off. Sometimes people chuck 'em for luck or in rage, and the like.\n\nBut some of those items have memories in 'em. Things so precious that losing it might as well be losing part of your heart. If you could help me look I'd be grateful.",
