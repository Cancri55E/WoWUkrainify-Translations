    "Description": "Inviting Alleria was a risk... but even at this moment, I feel it was worth taking. I know it was.\n\nI will speak with her on my own. In the meantime, I'd like you to venture into the city above. The pheromones Nizrek gifted you will allow access into the Umbral Bazaar. Observe the merchants, listen to the conversations, purchase their goods.\n\nThis city is as vibrant as Stormwind. And its people are as worthy of freeing from abuse as our own. Experience for yourself how similar we all are.",

    "RewardText": "A vibrant people, such as any other we've encountered together over the decades.\n\nThey deserve that same peace and protection that we seek for our own. \n\nLet us vow that, when forced to fight, it will always be against the source of strife. Never the victims of it.",
