    "Description": "We called you here today because it is \"Ascendance Day\". Queen Ansurek has deigned declare it a day to revel in our newfound, void-infused evolution--our \"Ascendance\". Please note my satirical nuance.\n\nWhile the streets are alive with festivity and joyous citizens, the Shadecasters planted through the Bazaar will be drowning the air with Ansurek's vile propaganda.\n\nTake this invention of mine. Use it to overwrite them with more... illuminating information for the public.",

    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Meet Alleria Windrunner at the Alchemy Lab in the City of Threads.",
    "RewardText": "Yes. The Vizier asked the same of me in the other city districts.\n\nI'll admit that my reluctance to trust Anduin's new ally has waned slightly. No more than a little finger's length, but even that is more than I anticipated.",
