    "Description": "That stage in the distance is where Ansurek will give her Ascendance Day speech.\n\nYou, Alleria, and I shall make our way up one of the nearby towers and observe. If we are to turn her own citizens against her, then we must also gain as much first hand experience with her tactics as we can manage.\n\nI've already told Alleria as much, but we cannot make our presence known. If we do run into any trouble, the Vizier has arranged for a set of getaway fliers at the edge of the Burrows where we first met.",
