    "RewardText": "I see you've returned my Spindle to me. And some rather interesting bits of evidence, to boot.\n\nIt seems that varlet Meesk has leveraged a willingness to slander his betters in order to gain the favor of Ansurek and her ilk. Not only is his power growing by the day, but it does so at the expense of Queen Neferess' legacy.\n\nWell, that simply will not stand. Return to me soon, my little morsel. I need some time to concoct our next course of action.",
