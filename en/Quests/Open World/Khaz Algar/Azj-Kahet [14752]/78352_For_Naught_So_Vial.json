    "Description": "Truthfully, I don't care what the nerubians are plotting. They are not the first upstart people seeking power, and they certainly won't be the last. The problem is how they're going about it. I fear that tampering with this Black Blood will threaten far more than the delicate ecosystems of Khaz Algar.\n\nWe must make sure that they never return to this pit again. Their equipment is still strewn throughout the pit. Destroy as much of it as you can manage.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Destroy 8 pieces of nerubian extracting equipment throughout the Breathing Pit.",
    "CompletionText": "The nerubians fled when those aberrations began appearing en masse, but I imagine they will try to come back for their ill-advised treasures. We need to make sure they have nothing to come back for.",
    "RewardText": "<Orweyna scowls.>\n\nThe nerubians are a bold people, but this seems extreme, even for them.",
