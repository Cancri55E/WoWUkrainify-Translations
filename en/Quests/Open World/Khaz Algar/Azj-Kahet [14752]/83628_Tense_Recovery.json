    "Description": "Things with these strangers are... tense. We do appreciate being allowed to take cover here in their camp. But they only seem to tolerate us at best. We offered to share our supplies, but that offended them, somehow.\n\nMy sister is gravely wounded. I can see herbs I could use to help her in that tent over there, but that giant snail is blocking the entrance. I can't get to them.\n\nI asked the guard on the hill for aid, but all he did was glare. I don't know what to do! Perhaps he'll listen to you?",
