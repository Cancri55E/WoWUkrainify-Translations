I have only spoken to you at all due to Orweyna's word. But I can feel On'hiea's disapproval from here.\n\nIt is uncomfortable to have mysteries at times. It is why so many fear the dark. It is unknown.\n\nI know I must seem cryptic. But our ways do not mean we are offended by the Arathi. They are creating tension where it does not exist for us.",
