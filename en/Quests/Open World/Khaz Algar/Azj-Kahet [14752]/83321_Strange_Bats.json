    "Description": "Hey. Her ladyship has a lead on some really strange bat that was flying around the Wormlands. \n\nThe spies reported it behaving more like a person than a bat. We think we might have a druid out there, but it ain't revealin' itself to the nerubians on purpose.\n\nYou have one of those faces that make people hesitate before punching. Head out there and take a look.",
