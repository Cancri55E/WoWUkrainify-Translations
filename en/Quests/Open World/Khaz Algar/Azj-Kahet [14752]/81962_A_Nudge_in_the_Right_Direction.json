Now that we have recovered my Brightshade Potions, I want you to go around the Silken Ward and show them off!\n\nThis will draw the ire of the Pale Weavelashers, I'm sure, but I want to show the populace that we don't need to live under their thumb. With a little aggressive motivation we can strike out on our own.\n\nYes, yes, this will do! Go around the Silken Ward and kill Pale Weavelashers. My potions will provide an extra kick the citizens will certainly love.",
