    "Description": "The Severed Threads is ready for you and your allies. You will be a lit torch to Ansurek's webs.\n\nThe General, the Vizier, and, myself, the Weaver, each have differing methods of combating our foes... And different benefits of  aiding our accomplices. You may prefer to prioritize one, or perhaps to dabble with all three instead.\n\nMeet with our representatives, and inform yourself on our varying practices. Then you may forge your first Pact.\n\nDon't worry, little morsel, no choice is ever permanent.",
