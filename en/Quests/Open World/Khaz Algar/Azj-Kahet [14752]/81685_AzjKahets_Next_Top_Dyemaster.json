    "Description": "Ren'khat and the Overspinner are fighting pincer-and-claw. Inside the spinneret. With no witnesses.\n\nWe have a unique opportunity here. If they took one another out... well, with Antourix's favorites dispatched and the whole of Rak-Ahat in disarray, the next best authority would be the caravan coordinator. Me.\n\nI don't love being in the spotlight, but it would be very beneficial to our secret-smuggling operation if those two didn't make it out of the dyeworks.",
