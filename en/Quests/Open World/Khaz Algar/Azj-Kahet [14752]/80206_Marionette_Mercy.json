    "Description": "It's perfect! The Puppetmaster is so interested in adding you to his collection, he literally invited us to go rescue the Magistrate.\n\nI don't want to imply I've been using you as bait this entire time, but... Let's just say certain calculated risks have paid off.\n\nEven such a skilled artist must have a way to correct potential errors. There has to be an antitoxin of sorts for that paralytic around here somewhere!\n\nFind it. And perhaps we test it before we go use it on the Magistrate. Just in case.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Find the Puppetmaster's Antiparalytic Serum.",
    "CompletionText": "I would worry we're taking too long, but considering how dramatic that Puppetmaster is, I can't imagine he'll start the show without us.\n\nWe should be prepared for something... rather unpleasant at that theater.",
    "RewardText": "Just what we were looking for.\n\nAnd about using you as bait... You know it's not personal in our line of work, friend.\n\nI was open from the start of all this that you were the status symbol I needed to navigate this area and socially manipulate the Ascended.\n\nAnd if there's one thing I know to bet on, it's the ability of the Ascended to covet power flaunted over others.",
