    "Description": "Hannan is correct only in that my presence here is not... strictly allowed.\n\nBut this corruption echoes in my mind, like a disruptive chord in the otherwise pure song of the world. Like a cry for help.\n\nI must heed that call. I must follow the dissonance to its source and find the heart of it, so that I may discover how to cleanse it.\n\nJoin me.",
