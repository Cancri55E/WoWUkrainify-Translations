    "Description": "Okay, I know when I'm beat. So I want to hire you as my Champion of Coin... or coinchamp.\n\nThis is all a part of my brilliant enterprising venture. See, these worms here are great at rooting out rich minerals like a niffen sniffing out high-quality mushrooms. \n\nI'm willing to bet all of my money--and your life--that they found a vein of sivstone. Great stuff, though I doubt a $c would know how to use it. \n\nTell you what, you bring me a shipment's worth and I'll go halfsies on the profits with ya!",
