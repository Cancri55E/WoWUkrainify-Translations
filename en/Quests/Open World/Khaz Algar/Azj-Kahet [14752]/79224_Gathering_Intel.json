    "Description": "The Widow Arak'nai sent word via one of those \"weave-rats\" of hers. She has a lead that may be relevant to our cause, and has invited us to investigate. All the training in the world is useless without knowledge of our enemy.\n\nMy own reconnaissance efforts in Azj-Kahet were met with... mixed results, as you may recall. I admit I am not keen on venturing down there again so soon. Fortunately, reinforcements have arrived with a capable spymaster.\n\nUnfortunately, she is... well. You'll see.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak with Widow Arak'nai at the Weaver's Lair in Azj-Kahet.",
    "RewardText": "As I was telling your surly little spymaster, I expect this to be a mutually beneficial undertaking.\n\nWe shall both walk out of it with the information we need.",
