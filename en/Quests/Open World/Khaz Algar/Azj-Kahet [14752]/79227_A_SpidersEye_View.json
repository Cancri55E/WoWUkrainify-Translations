    "Description": "I have eyes in every crevice of the city save for one that has... eluded me.\n\nThe Transformatory is the grounds of Ansurek's most precocious minions and treasured pets. It is where the Ascension process was developed. I've only gotten my claws on it recently, thanks to dear Y'tekhi. Much of it remains uncomfortably shrouded.\n\nA more legs-on approach is in order. Place shadecasters to collect intel from my scouts, then meet Y'tekhi and your own spymaster Voss in a discreet corner of the district.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Place shadecasters to rendezvous with the Weaver's scouts in the Umbral Bazaar, the Eastern Span, and the Twitching Gorge.",
    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Rendezvous with Y'tekhi and Lilian Voss in the Transformatory.",
    "RewardText": "I don't like the sound of those reports. Looks like whatever they're cooking is coming to a head, right in time for us to walk in.\n\nDon't worry. I'll let you know if we get in too deep.",
