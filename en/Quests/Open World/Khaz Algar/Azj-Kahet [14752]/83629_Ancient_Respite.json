    "Description": "This was once a great lake. Over time the roots ruptured its floor, and drained the water away. I have lived here for all of my lifetime and witnessed it all. But now, darker changes have come.\n\nSometimes changes comes with death. Decay is natural.\n\nBut the mites that feed upon my people are not. They spread an odd infestation that makes my bark feel like it crawls from my body.\n\nDestroy these mites, so that I may rest without fear of their mouths upon my sleeping form.",
