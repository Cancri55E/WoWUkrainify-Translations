    "Description": "These logs of Zev'kall's... he is wasting numerous nerubian lives. Throwing them away like some rabid mantid.\n\nWe must act. As I said, Zev'kall doesn't produce his own pheromone marks anymore due to this 'Ascension' process. He's been forced to use mine. His alchemist is trying to concoct some for him... but once they do, what of me?\n\nTake those false pheromones and sneak them out of Siegehold. Expose Zev'kall, use them... you're creative, aren't you? Just make it messy.",

    "RewardText": "Smuggle these out? Hmm.\n\nI bet we can use these later, but... if we need to, we'll use them to escape.\n\nHopefully it won't come to that.",
