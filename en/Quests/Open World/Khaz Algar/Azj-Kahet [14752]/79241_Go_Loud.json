    "Description": "So much for keeping this operation quiet. At least now that our cover's blown, we can really mess things up.\n\nThey're hauling weapons across the south bridge. If we turn those weapons against them, they'll have to resupply their whole army. That'll buy us time, at least.\n\nI've identified six weak spots across the convoy. Rig up bombs to all six, then get out of there and watch the fireworks.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Plant 6 Commandeered Nerubian Charges at specified points across the convoy, then remotely detonate them.",
    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Return to Lilian Voss at the Weaver's Lair.",
    "RewardText": "Not only is the convoy in shambles, but we were able to slip away in the chaos. If there's one thing you're good at, it's making noise.\n\nStaying quiet? Eh, we can work on it.",
