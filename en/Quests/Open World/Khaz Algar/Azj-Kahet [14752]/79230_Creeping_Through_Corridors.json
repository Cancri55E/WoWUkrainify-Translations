    "Description": "I've identified three sites of interest to investigate. \n\nA stockpile on the east side of the complex, a warehouse in the center, and lastly, that big storehouse with royal Sureki flags outside it. We'll rendezvous there.\n\nThere's less chance of discovery if we move separately through the area. You may be hidden from most nerubians, but the Ascended will sniff you out. Chuck some of these anger pheromones at them if you get heat, it'll distract them.\n\nStay sharp, stay quiet.",

    "CompletionText": "Don't let your guard down. Not here.",
    "RewardText": "We came down here to figure out what these nerubians were up to. I don't think I like the answer.",
