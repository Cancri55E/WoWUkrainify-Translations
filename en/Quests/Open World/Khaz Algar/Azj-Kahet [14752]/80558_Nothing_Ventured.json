    "Description": "These niffen have been down here a long time--long enough to build a village and set up trade with the nerubians. Some of them are even able to trade in that big nerubian city!\n\nThe goblins, though? They're from the Venture Company. No wonder General Anub'azal was skeptical of me, if he's used to dealing with them.\n\nWhat are they doing all the way down here? Let's try to learn what led them to this place.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Learn what you can from the goblins in Mmarl.",
    "CompletionText": "Take a good look around for loose-lipped goblins.",
    "RewardText": "At least they're willing to talk to you, even if they are rude. Maybe you can convince them working together is mutually beneficial.\n\nTry something a little... transactional. They'll appreciate that.",
