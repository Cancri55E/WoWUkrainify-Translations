They pose a threat to the great roots that stretch through this place.\n\nYes, the tree provides sustenance for many living things, but this is not some small band of bugs nibbling on a leaf. This is a blight. Their numbers must be culled for the good of the whole. \n\nBy my oath I am unable to raise a hand to interfere. However... you have sworn no such oath. Will you do what must be done?",
