    "Description": "We've received an invitation. Or rather, you have, $n.\n\nIt's a request to meet with the Vizier. That name rattles even the most wealthy and powerful figures in the City of Threads.\n\nGaining this individual as an ally could seal our victory against Ansurek's horrid little shadow for good.\n\nYou're to meet them in the Burrows. Use the pheromone dispenser here in my lair to mask yourself enough to enter safely.",

    "RewardText": "It surprises me little to see that you've made allies amongst the Kaheti, $n.\n\nAnd, yes. I'm alive and well. \n\n<A wry smile crawls across Anduin's face.>\n\nNot too much of a shock, I hope?",
