    "Description": "This is not exactly the place for a long talk, so I will be brief.\n\nThese roots you see are part of something much greater than you know, and it is my job to protect them. \n\nIf it isn't obvious to you already, this place is teeming with writhing Black Blood. If we do not act, it will spread deeper and further still.\n\nYou want allies? Fine. Help me cleanse this place and protect these roots, and I will at least hear you out.",
