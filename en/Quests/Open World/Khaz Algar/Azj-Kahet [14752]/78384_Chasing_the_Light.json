    "Description": "Anduin survived that swarm. I do not doubt that for a moment. Even so, the nerubians are everywhere and he is just one man.\n\nWherever he goes, wherever he is taken, I will find him. Find me any sign that he yet lives. That is all I need to follow him to Azeroth's end.",

    "RewardText": "A shattered gauntlet and some scraps of cloth... but no corpse. That's good, at least. He's alive, and he fought back.\n\nStill, it's not much to go on. Most rangers would be understandably stumped.\n\nLuckily, I am not most rangers.",
