    "Description": "I cannot stand to look at this any longer. I must act.\n\n$n. You have survived the Unseeming before. Now we must go there together. I must see it for myself if I am to believe this vile place truly cannot be cleansed.\n\nWe will kill what we can and search for some sliver of hope that we can still restore this land.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Acquire 50 stacks of Unseeming Shift and collect 3 samples from elite enemies lost in the Unseeming.\n\nIn addition to destroying extractors, you can also acquire Unseeming Shift by standing in pools of Black Blood. However, be careful as you will gain stacks quickly by doing so.",
    "CompletionText": "Hannan's concerns are not unfounded.\n\nBut I cannot simply witness this corruption and make no attempt to root it out.",
    "RewardText": "<Orweyna's voice is low with rage, but you see it is heartbreak shining in her eyes.>\n\nThis place is truly too far gone. There is no fixing what they have done here.",
