    "Description": "We found these prisoners fleeing a nearby nerubian military base.\n\nThe circumstances of their escape are... unclear, even to them. As if someone else created the opening they needed to escape.\n\nThey need rest, but we need to find out what happened in there.\n\nFood first. Maybe once they've regained some of their strength, they'll remember something.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Hand out 3 Arathi Rations.",
    "CompletionText": "We managed to throw together a simple stew of sorts. It's not the tastiest, but it has to be better than whatever they had to eat in spider prison.",
    "RewardText": "These people have been through so much. Civilians--not even soldiers. Most of them didn't sign up for this. And yet they became prisoners of war.\n\nIf anything back at the nerubian base could give us an advantage, we have to take it.",
