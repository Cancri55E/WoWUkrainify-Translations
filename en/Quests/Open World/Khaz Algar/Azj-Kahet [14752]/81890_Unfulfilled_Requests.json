    "Description": "I have heard the citizens of the Silken Ward are having trouble with a group of Ascended called the Pale Weavelashers.\n\nThe new ward is supposed to be a fresh start for citizens of the capital, at least that is the way the Queen tells it. In actuality it is a way for her to tighten her grip on those she distrust. \n\nMeet with my assistant Sum'latha. I sent her there ahead of time to gather information. She can fill you in on any details.",
