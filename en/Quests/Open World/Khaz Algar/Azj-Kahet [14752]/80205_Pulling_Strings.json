    "Description": "Just think of it! Overcrawlers, war prisoners, civilians, fellow nerubians, important nobility being kidnapped and turned into puppets right under the Magistrate's nose.\n\nIt's horrific--and exactly what I needed! If we save the Magistrate from this fate, he'll owe me. Not just for saving his life, but to keep quiet about all this.\n\nWe're off to the theater, then. If you can keep the Puppetmaster occupied, I'll free High Elevator Etak'kaht from his grasp.\n\nHopefully he's not part of the show yet.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Confront the Puppetmaster to rescue High Elevator Etak'kaht.",
    "RewardText": "I'm thrilled. There couldn't have been a more perfect opportunity to get the Magistrate's attention. And the Weaver will be pleased to hear we have him in our pocket indefinitely, with this blackmail situation.\n\nNow, I suppose I'm off to the Transformatory.\n\n<Tx'itk shudders subtly.>\n\nI... I must not let my resolve falter now. The Weaver has asked this of me. I will be her eyes.",
