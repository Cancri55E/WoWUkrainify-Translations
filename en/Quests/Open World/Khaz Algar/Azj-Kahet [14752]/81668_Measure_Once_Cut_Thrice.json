    "Description": "I was promised an important, glamorous, enviable position of power when I left the city for Rak-Ahat.\n\nThis warehouse job? Neither important nor enviable. And certainly not glamorous.\n\nGrand Overspinner Antourix has been at this for far too long. She doesn't understand my vision. All she wants are drones that do exactly what she wants, how she wants it.\n\nTake out her most loyal workers. We'll see how tough she is on her own once I take over the dyeworks.",
