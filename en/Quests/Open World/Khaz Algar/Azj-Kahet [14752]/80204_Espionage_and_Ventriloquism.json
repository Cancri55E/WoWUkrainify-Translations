    "Description": "The Puppetmaster is our best lead for finding the Magistrate.\n\nBut is it just me, or did those puppets seem... horrifically lifelike? If this artist is behind the Magistrate's disappearance, he certainly isn't just off to see a puppet show.\n\nWe should investigate the Puppetmaster's workshop. Question him, or at least ransack his things. Just a bit. Until we find something useful.\n\nYou'll have to keep playing your rather undignified role in this charade. But it will pay off for us.",
