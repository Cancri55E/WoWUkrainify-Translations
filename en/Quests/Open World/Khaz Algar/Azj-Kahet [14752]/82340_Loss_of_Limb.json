    "Description": "Happy greetings! I am Mr. Sunflower, and this is my tea room and therapy space. It is safe place for everyone!\n\nI wonder if you might be willing to help a patient of mine. Vi'azl is deathly afraid of creatures with fewer limbs. I think it has grown into a deep phobia of dismemberment. I'm trying to get to the bottom of this diagnosis. \n\nWould you speak to him, and demonstrate that you, who does not have eight limbs, are not so terrifying after all?",
