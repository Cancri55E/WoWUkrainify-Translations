    "Description": "As you might have heard, things haven't gone as intended for the citizens of the Silken Ward. The Pale Weavelashers have been keeping a tight grasp on the citizens. \n\nI wasn't able to find much before an Ascended kicked me out for snooping around. You are a fresh face, go around the Silken Ward and speak to the citizens, see if you can find a way to help them.\n\nAlso seek out Alchemist Talbax. I heard his name spoken a few times. He could be a useful contact.",
