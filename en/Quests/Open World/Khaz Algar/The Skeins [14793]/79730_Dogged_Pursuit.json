    "Description": "But of course, simply stealing the relics isn't enough. We need to teach the Queen's pet burrow-worms a lesson in futility, or they will simply start the whole process again!\n\nThat shouting buffoon near the central passage is Rez'kal, a member of Ansurek's personal academic entourage. He's... not very bright, but he makes up for it with enough strength to send either of us through a wall.\n\nI'm not inclined to go toe to toe with the big oaf today. Would you mind overmuch doing one last favor for me?",

    "RewardText": "Ah! There you are. Fine job back there with the lummox. He may have been a buffoon, but he was a buffoon with very sharp blades on his arms.\n\nNow, with relics in hand, it is time for me to make my grand exit. I've a great many pilfered riches to re-appropriate, after all! I've truly enjoyed our time working together, though. Perhaps, with luck, our paths will cross again soon.",
