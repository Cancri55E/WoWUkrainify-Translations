    "Description": "Ansurek and her ilk are so short-sighted. They think that by filling our museum with trophies of their recent conquests instead of relics of our own history, we will be less inclined to remember where we came from.\n\nWell, they are probably right--in the long term, at least. History has a habit of bending towards the voice of its teller.\n\nBut that is where we come in, $n. Those relics that the Sureki forces stole? It's time to steal them back.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Loot six Pillaged Trophies from the Royal Repository.",
    "CompletionText": "Well, $n? I'm sure the place is filled with a queen's ransom.",
    "RewardText": "<Ar'syn's many eyes sparkle in the cavelight.>\n\nThough my goals today are on the philanthropic side of things, I must profess my appreciation for a good heist well-executed. Look at all of these treasures! I do so look forward to returning them to their rightful homes.\n\n...For a finder's fee, of course. Imagine if Azj-Kahet's legendary legerdemain became some sort of folk hero?! Ugh, the very word sours on my tongue.",
