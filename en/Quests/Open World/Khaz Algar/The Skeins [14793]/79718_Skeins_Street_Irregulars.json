    "Description": "I would like nothing more than to go in and take a few of these pompous Sureki royalists out. It would make our infiltration that much easier, and it would serve them right for trampling upon our history. But I cannot get close without bringing a whole host of guards down upon the Skeins.\n\nYou, though? No one will bat an eye at wanton violence if it comes from an overcrawler. Why not get in there and thin them out a bit?\n\nOh, don't give me that look. You were going to do it anyway.",

    "RewardText": "I'll be honest, friend. I find brute force somewhat lacking in artistry.\n\nBut goodness, you make it into a performance piece unto itself! Color me impressed. And a bit intimidated.",
