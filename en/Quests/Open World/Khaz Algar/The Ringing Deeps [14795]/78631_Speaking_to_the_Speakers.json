    "Description": "I've heard about a problem nearby, and I think I know what's wrong.\n\nWe used to have a mining operation northeast of Gundargaz. When we moved out, kobolds moved in.\n\nWe haven't heard from those kobolds in a long time, but it sounds like they're raiding us now! And the High Speaker is doing nothing about it.\n\nSomeone has to do something. If we can solve this, more Machine Speakers will listen to us. If the High Speaker doesn't get results, we will.",
