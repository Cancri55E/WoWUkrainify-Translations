    "Description": "Apologies. Arbauch was not here for repairs--he stole that golem.\n\nArbauch and I worked alongside it for years in the darkest reaches of the Deeps. The work took its toll on the golem. It became erratic, dangerous even. We planned to decommission it, but when the time came, Arbauch couldn't bear it. He'd become attached. Before it could be destroyed, he took it and fled.\n\nIt must be found, but the damage to this substation is catastrophic. With your help, I will attempt repairs.",
