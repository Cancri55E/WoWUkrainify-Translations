    "Description": "Go ahead, laugh. I would be as well if I didn't have such pressing business. My bot's foot clipped a nearby rock, spilled me out and then righted herself. Without me in the cockpit! \n\nI'm grounded while she floats there quite cheerfully. Can you believe it? \n\nListen, if you are heading up to Shadowvein Point, will you let Kagfritha know that I'll be late for my shift? I need to wait for this hunk of metal to run out of fuel and dip low enough for me to get back in the driver's seat.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak with Kagfritha in Shadowvein Point.",
    "RewardText": "Sinruna got tossed again, did she? I keep telling her she's flying too low. Maybe this'll knock some sense into her.",
