    "Description": "Gundargaz is my home. Or at least, it was before the High Speaker saw fit to reassign me above ground. I've missed my home, but it's... changed.\n\nAs the number of Machine Speakers decreases, we're in a race against time. \n\nLately, we've been especially weary of our assigned tasks, but as always, we must bear our burdens.\n\nLet me show you around the area. There are some earthen I would like you to meet.",

    "RewardText": "Problems are increasing, and our numbers are dwindling.\n\nThe High Speaker is distracted, kobolds are attacking, shipments are missing from Taelloch, and earthen aren't returning from their shifts.\n\nWhere to begin? Looks like our work is cut out for us.",
