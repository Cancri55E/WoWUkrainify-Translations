    "Description": "My father thinks that while he and Dagran were dealing with the skardyn tae the south, he caught a sensation o' his old hammer, Fearbreaker.\n\nHe said it slipped out o' his fingers when Dalaran crashed, and it's been bothering him mightily. That hammer belongs tae the Bronzebeard clan, and has for generations. But he hasn't been himself lately, either.\n\nI'm willing tae have a look, so he doesn't worry that he might've missed it. Meet me down at Camp Murroch, and we'll have a quick look around.",
