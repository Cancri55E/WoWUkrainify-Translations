    "Description": "The elementals are coming from inside that cave. We only made it part of the way in before needing to retreat. \n\nI could see some flickering within, some strange glowing thing that looked almost like a tear in space from which the elementals poured forth! We managed to close one of these portals, but there are more.\n\nI need to stay with Nanthaz. It is up to you now, if you can manage. Destroy the rifts and find their source. I suspect it lies deeper within the cave.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Destroy 4 rifts and find their source within the cave.",
    "CompletionText": "Destroy what rifts you come across, but above all, find their source! I suspect you will find it deep inside the nearby cave.\n\nThe miners you rescued spoke of breaking through to a crystal-filled room, and of the elementals pouring forth from within.",
    "RewardText": "You return with good news, I hope? \n\n<You tell her about Urthgrafr Riftcaller.>\n\nWith Urthgrafr's defeat, we should have no problem cleaning up the rest of the elementals and rifts ourselves. We are lucky that you came along when you did.\n\nThank you for your help, friend. Do not worry about me or Nanthaz. We will make our way back to the refinery once he has caught his breath. Gratitude, outlander. And may all earthen Awaken one day.",
