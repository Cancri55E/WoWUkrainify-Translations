    "Description": "Berrund here says that the massive beast standing over Fearbreaker is very particular about what kinds of creatures it allows near it.\n\nIf we blend in, he says, we can get close enough tae nab the hammer. But tae blend in, he says we have tae get covered by the dust an' pollen in the grotto. \n\nThose Lashrooms look like they're a good place to start. \n\nIt all seems suspicious tae me, but fer now, we'll play along until I can recover Fearbreaker and bring it back to my father.",

    "RewardText": "<Berrund the Gleaming appears not to have a speck of pollen on himself.>\n\nYou got yourself good and covered in that lashroom dust, all right.\n\nI'm a bit surprised you're not itching and sneezing, like your friend here.",
