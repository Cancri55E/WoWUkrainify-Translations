    "Description": "My oath is to be a compiler. I collect and tell the stories of our people.\n\n<Brennok sighs.>\n\nIs there wisdom in stories told by someone who never lived them? I've never had an adventure. I was afraid to overwrite the stories entrusted to me.\n\nSo I started transcribing them into a book I hid here. Each time we returned to Shadowvein Point, I added more.\n\nI was going to leave and pass on the book, but scorpids ransacked it. Please, find the missing pages before they stuff them into their nests.",
