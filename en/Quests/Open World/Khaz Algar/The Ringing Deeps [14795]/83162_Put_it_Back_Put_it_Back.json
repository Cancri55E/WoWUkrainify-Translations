    "Description": "It's going to ruin everything! Who wants to visit a resort with a thirty-foot tall ghost-deer? Ok, no need to panic. It's probably just a little miffed you took its skull.\n\nFirst, you gotta get rid of some of these slimes. Then, get that skull out of here. The farther the better.\n\nOh man, they're gonna get ectoplasm in the hot pools!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Stomp slimes and take Alhainr's Skull away from town.",
    "CompletionText": "Hurry up, before this whole place is wrecked!",
    "RewardText": "Whew, that was close. This whole thing has really taught me to value the beauty of nature.\n\n<The goblin breaks into laughter.>\n\nReally had you going there, huh? Still, think I'll leave Abyssal Excavation alone for awhile.",
