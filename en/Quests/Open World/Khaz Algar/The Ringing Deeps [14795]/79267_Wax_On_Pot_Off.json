    "Description": "If candles are important to kobold society, I have an idea that might disrupt their production... or at least make sure there's an unpleasant surprise waiting for our enemy.\n\nTake that cinderbrew. Drop some in those large vats of wax the kobolds are prepping at the top of that hill. It's a powerful explosive. It burns aggressively, so try not to drop any.\n\nIt should certainly make any candles made with that wax quite feisty, once they're lit.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Sabotage the pots of wax in the Warrens.",
    "CompletionText": "Try not to breathe too many of the fumes.",
    "RewardText": "Hopefully, that takes them down a peg or two.\n\nA leader's power waxes and wanes. With all this destruction, the Candle King's power is waning.",
