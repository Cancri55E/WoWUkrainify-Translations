    "Description": "There is the creature standing between us and that magic hammer. It certainly made an impact when it landed here in the Ringing Deeps, didn't it? Look at the size of that crater!\n\nWith the pollen and water splashed on you like this, you should be able to approach that beast and, theoretically, not be harmed. You'll blend right in with it!\n\nBut if it does turn aggressive, don't worry, I'll be right behind you.\n\nWe'll get that hammer out of here safely!",
