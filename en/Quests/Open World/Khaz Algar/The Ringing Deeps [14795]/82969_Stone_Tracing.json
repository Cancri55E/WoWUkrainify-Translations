    "Description": "Couldn't help overhearing. Not to brag, but goblins are specialists in the field of rampaging robots.\n\nIf that golem's as unstable as Danagh says, it'll be leaking all sorts of energy. Take this, run a few scans, and you'll find it. Oh, and be careful. Animals tend to go a little cuckoo when you power this thing on.\n\nNo charge--a murderous golem's bad for business. And I kinda feel bad making you work just to find a dead guy.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Scan remnants of the golem to triangulate its location.",
    "RewardText": "Curious. It seemed to be wandering along the river. Unimportant, we have its location. We will find it and decommission it.",
