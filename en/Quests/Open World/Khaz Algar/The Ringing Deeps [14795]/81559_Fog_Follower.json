    "Description": "With the trackers attached, we should be able to find out where the fog beasts are coming from. The trackers leave a residue in the air. It's invisible to the naked eye, but I can use the mists to reveal it in places where there's a high enough concentration.\n\nTheoretically, this should lead us to the places they most frequent. Maybe a nest! That I'll then have to report to my employer... hm.\n\nAnyway. Let's see what we can find.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Help Noli find the source of the fog beasts with her mist tracking ability.",
    "RewardText": "Wow. I mean, wow! We learned so much in so little time! But now, I'm supposed to report this to people who want them gone?\n\nI think people are wrong about the fog beasts. They don't attack unless threatened. And even when we entered their nest, they teleported us away safely. \n\nWe haven't even had time to talk about the fact that they can do that kind of magic! Amazing!",
