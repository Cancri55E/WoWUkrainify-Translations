    "Description": "Many earthen fell when the kobolds took this mine.\n\nWorse, those who fell were left to crumble where they dropped. There was no attempt to recover them. We couldn't provide closure or respect their memories. Why? Why did we forsake the fallen?\n\nWe will not fail them again, $n. Gather the identification plaques of those we lost, so we may commemorate them properly.",

    "RewardText": "Thank you, $n. The fallen will be remembered.\n\nThe earthen above us have their own rituals of remembrance, and the Machine Speakers have procedures in place. \n\nThere's a plinth in the town square with the plaques of the fallen. Jurlax will ensure that the proper observances are performed... along with process checks and a recalculation of worker allocation. Work never stops here.",
