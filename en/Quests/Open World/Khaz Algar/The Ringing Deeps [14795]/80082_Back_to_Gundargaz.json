    "Description": "We may not have overthrown the Candle King, but our work here has surely relieved some of the pressure facing Gundargaz. And it's made us more than a few new allies, as well.\n\nOur new friends will not be forgotten, on my word as Speaker. There is a...regrettable amount of available housing in Gundargaz as of late. It will be nice to feel the city come to life again, and we can certainly use the manpower.\n\nShall we bring them home, $n?",
