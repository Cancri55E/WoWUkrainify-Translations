    "Description": "When the magma transport pipe failed, our workers rushed down to begin repairs.\n\nThe elementals caught us unawares, rising up and attacking with great gouts of lava.\n\nFortunately, we earthen are made of stern stuff and a little magma is hardly going to be the end of us. Unfortunately, the cooling magma has hardened into stone shells, entombing our repair crews where they stood.\n\nSmash their stony prisons and free my workers!",
