    "Description": "When that magic hammer fell into the Deeps, I knew it could be a formidable weapon against the skardyn menace. Your friend has told me that it's 'particular' about its wielder.\n\nFortunately, I am a hero!\n\nAnd as a hero, I know how to get close to it. We need to have a good mix of pollen and water plastered onto us. That way, the beast standing over it will think we're just like it.\n\nThat mineral water has to be the exact right temperature to mix with the lashroom dust and blend in.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Acquire the proper-temperature mineral water from the Living Grotto springs.",
    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Meet Moira Thaurissan by Fearbreaker's crater in the Living Grotto.",
    "RewardText": "That was a right pain. But we got the water Berrund asked for.\n\nIt's time we get a move on. I don't want my father's hammer to just languish there in the mud. That doesn't sit right with me, not at all.",
