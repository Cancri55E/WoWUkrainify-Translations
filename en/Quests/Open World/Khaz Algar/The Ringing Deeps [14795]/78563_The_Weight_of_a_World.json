    "Description": "My tools didn't randomly end up where you found them. They were placed there. By me.\n\nI had reached a point so low that I saw no alternative. The machines, the great work of my people, were never going to sing again. So why should I bother to keep them repaired?\n\nBut now I see, and now, I understand!\n\nThe last tool I need, I dropped it into the water, and it was eaten by a giant creature. I think that one might need a bit more force to return it to me.",
