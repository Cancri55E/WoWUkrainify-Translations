    "Description": "This is the only road to the elevator, he should have been here by now. \n\nUnless... he didn't take the road! He wouldn't want to be seen. \n\nHe has no idea how dangerous the deeps can be. We have to find him!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Find Brennok.",
    "RewardText": "If he'd only told me sooner... stone-headed oaf. But if he's set on leaving, he'll need a guide. Not sure he knows how to put one foot in front of the other on his own.\n\nHis chronicle is already on a rook headed to Gundargaz. They'll take care of his stories. At least until he's had his fill of his own.\n\nMy oath is, and always was, to care for him. I can't do that if I keep him down here.\n\nThank you for helping him.",
