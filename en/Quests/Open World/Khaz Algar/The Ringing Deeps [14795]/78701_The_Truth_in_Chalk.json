    "Description": "So the people of Taelloch use chalk on slate to leave messages to each other. So many clues! But what does it all mean....\n\nI'm seeing a pattern, and I think it points to the mines. If the workers haven't already been lost, I'd expect them to be in the mines.\n\nAnd I know the foreman is the key. She has to be.",
