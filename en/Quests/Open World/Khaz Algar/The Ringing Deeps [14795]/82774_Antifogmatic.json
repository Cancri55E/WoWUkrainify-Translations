    "Description": "Machine speakers have no love for fog beasts. Where there is fog, rust is sure to follow. Still, I'd prefer not to harm them. Arbauch always said it was bad luck.\n\nTake this device. The glands you collected should provide enough power to disperse the fog without hurting the fog beasts within.\n\nCaution. Fog beasts are skittish, but other creatures may also lurk.",
