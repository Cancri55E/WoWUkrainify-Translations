    "Title": "The Lost Dynasty",
    "Description": "I wonder if I could bother you for another task. My daughter, the good Sentinel Commander Lyalia here, refuses to let me go into the field.\n\nI have spent everyday in that oubliette staring at the ruins to our north, itching to investigate.\n\nIf we are where I suspect we are those ruins could contain the key we need to finding the fabled Pools of Youth!\n\nPlease, $c! Go to those ruins and salvage any tablets that still have writing on them.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Obtain 6 Dynastic Tablets.",
    "CompletionText": "It is one thing to research the lost dynasties. It is quite another to visit their ancient ruins.\n\nI am giddy as I have not felt in centuries!",
    "RewardText": "Oh! Fabulous! Fabulous!\n\nYour one trip has advanced my research more than ten years of reading dusty tomes and decaying scrolls...\n\nAnd those \"mogu\" you saw. I have been doing some research as well as speaking to Kang on the subject.\n\nI suspect now that they were the race of the lost dynasties that my research is derived from.\n\nOf course, that also means that they are the ones who used to control the Pools of Youth.",
