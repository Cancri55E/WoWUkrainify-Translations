    "Description": "So, now that you've got a vibe for how cranes fight, I've got a doozy for you.\n\nNeedlebeak!\n\nOr at least, that's what I'm calling him. Biggest crane I ever saw. And its beak is so sharp it's like a sword.\n\nNorthwest of here you'll find the big water fall that kicks off the Dojani River. Needlebeak likes to hang out by the waterfall.\n\nYou bring me its beak as a trophy and I will talk you up a good game to Nesingwary.",
