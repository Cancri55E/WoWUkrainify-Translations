    "Title": "Threat from Dojan",
    "Description": "While you were at the ruins dusting off tablets for my father I lost five scouts to wandering mogu patrols.\n\nThese creatures apparently have little interest in peace and are about as trustworthy as the Horde.\n\nThey are too numerous and we are too weak, however.\n\nGo to the ruins west of here and cull the mogu numbers. They won't be expecting a $c.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Kill 6 Dojani Reclaimers, 8 Dojani Surveyors, and 4 Dojani Enforcers.",
    "CompletionText": "Kang has been sharing stories with me about these mogu.\n\nApparently ages ago they ruled as emperors subjugating all free races of Pandaria and the surrounding regions. Now they are little more than hoodlums.\n\nTo see these mogu fight though, I suspect they are trying to rekindle some of their older ideals and ambitions.",
    "RewardText": "Well done, $p. Another few missions like that and we might have to make you an honorary sentinel.",
    "Objectives": []
