    "Description": "I apologize for my harsh words earlier. Dezco might have been right to wait and move west with a unified strength.\n\nThe mogu hit us hard when we were searching the ruins west of here. They ambushed us using summoning portals and some dark magics. I haven't seen such evil sorcery used since Outland. \n\nWe need a respite. Head west, kill their summoners, cut their supply line.",
