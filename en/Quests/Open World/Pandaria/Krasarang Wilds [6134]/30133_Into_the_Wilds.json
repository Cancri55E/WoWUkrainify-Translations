    "Description": "Deep in the wilds, on the southern coast where the Krasarang River meets the sea, rests the Temple of the Red Crane, home of the great Chi-Ji and his most devout followers.\n\nThey should be told of what happened here.\n\nIf you're headed that way, I have a favor to ask; We often send supplies to the temple, but our last courier has not returned. Please look for signs of him as you travel - where the road forks at the Dojani River, he'd have gone north. When you reach the temple, find Koro Mistwalker.",
