    "Description": "I am totally on to another great scam!\n\nWhen I was flying overhead I saw a really ancient tigress prowling about.\n\nDo you know how much her blood would go for on the black market? Not to mention if I convince some warlocks it adds extra potency to their summoning spells or something.\n\nIf you bring me back some of her blood I will cut you in on the scam. She was prowling about on the far side of the Dojani River from here.",
