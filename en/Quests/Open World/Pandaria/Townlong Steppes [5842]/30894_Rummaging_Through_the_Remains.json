    "Description": "I do have another task for you, $n, though it's a might grim. I really need to get to the bottom of this mantid poison, but to do that, I need more information directly from the source.\n\nWhile you're down on the southern battlefield, could you bring me back some mantid limbs so that I can examine their intact poison glands.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Recover 20 Krik'thik Limbs.",
    "CompletionText": "I'm hoping to find a permanent counter to the mantid poison so that the men won't be afflicted in the first place. It may take some time to piece it together.",
    "RewardText": "These are in great condition! Thank you, $n!\n\nYou know, I've managed to distil some of their poison into a form that we can apply readily. I've even come up with some methods for weaving it into spell-casting, if you believe it. Would you like to give some a try?",
