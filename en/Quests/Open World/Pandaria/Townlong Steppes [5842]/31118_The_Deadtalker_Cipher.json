    "Description": "We need to understand what went wrong with the Deadtalkers. \n\nFor so many years, the Deadtalkers were simply responsible for maintaining the burial grounds and holding funerals for fallen warriors.\n\nFrom a recent raid, we've recovered a tablet from the grounds that is clearly written using a cipher, but it isn't one we've encountered before. If you can gather a ciphered scroll from one of the Deadtalkers, we can begin to put together the cypher and understand what's happened.",
