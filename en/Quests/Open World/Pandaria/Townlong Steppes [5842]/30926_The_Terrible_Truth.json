    "Description": "It is with a heavy heart that I confirm your suspicions. The mantid are indeed under the sway of the Sha of Fear.\n\nIt was OUR sworn duty to confine that creature beneath our temple. Unfortunately, our vigil faltered, our defenses buckled, and the sha escaped. It is with the mantid now.\n\nSee for yourself. The mantid burrowed into the western side of our island.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Investigate the Niuzao Catacombs, then slay the Dread Shadow that dwells within.",
    "RewardText": "Let me make this clear... that creature was NOT the Sha of Fear. Simply a shadow... a fraction of the sha's true power.\n\nNo, the Sha of Fear is with the mantid now. The elders of my order need to be informed of this immediately.\n\nI will handle the rest from here. Thank you for your assistance, $r. Once again, your kind proves to be an asset to Pandaria.",
