    "Description": "From what I've gathered, the Kunzen hozen have two chiefs. One is harmless - he deals with potions, medicines, and ancient fables. The other one is in charge of the Kunzen's hunters - and the only thing they've been hunting lately is our crops.\n\nThe Hunter-Chief is a problem waiting to be solved. I'm sure the local farmers would be grateful if you went up there and, you know, \"took care\" of him.",
