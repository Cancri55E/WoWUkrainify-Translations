    "Description": "Look at it, $n: the Gilded Fan. I heared lots of good things about the water they got here. Lots of bad things, too.\n\nNo sayin' what kind of water Chen's gonna be needin', so what say we make him a little sampler platter?\n\nCome on, let's get movin'. We'll go scoop up some water together.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Guide Mudmug to Swirling Pools within the Gilded Fan, and help him collect 30 pawfuls of Gladewater.\n\nIf you become separated from Mudmug, you can find him next to the giant banana in the Gilded Fan.",
    "CompletionText": "That Stormstout feller says that he's the best brewer that ever was. Might be true, couldn't tell ya one way or the 'nother as of yet.",
    "RewardText": "Lookee that, neighbor! That is quite the collection of water we got here. With magical water like this, I'm sure that Chen'll make a brew that really shines.\n\nOr possibly a brew that lands someone in the outhouse for a month. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.",
