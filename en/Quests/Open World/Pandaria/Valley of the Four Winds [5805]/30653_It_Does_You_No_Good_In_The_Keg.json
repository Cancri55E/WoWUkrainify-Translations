We should bring the two together.\n\nThere's a bunch o' folks out there in the fields, riskin' their lives for Pandaria. You an' I should at least bring 'em a keg or two.\n\nThey might raise their mugs in victory. They might enjoy one last drink before gettin' skivvered by a mantid. Either way, I wouldn't want 'em to fight without a good brew in their belly.",
