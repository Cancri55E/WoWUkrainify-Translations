    "Description": "Hey $n, I've been thinkin' recently about expanding my farm.\n\nSee that plot there that's just covered in weeds? If we can get rid of those weeds, we could use that land for planting.\n\nI heard there's a farmer by the name of Gai Lan who knows a thing or two about weed whackin'.\n\nHis farm is just out west. Go talk to him and see if he'd be willing to help us.",
