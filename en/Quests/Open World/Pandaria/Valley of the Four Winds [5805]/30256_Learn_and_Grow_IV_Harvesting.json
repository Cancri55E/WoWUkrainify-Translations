    "Description": "It's time for our hard work to pay off! Normally we'd have to wait a day before the crops are ready to harvest.\n\nFortunately, those seeds Greenfield gave us were specially designed to grow FAST. The yield won't be worth much, but they're good for stepping new farmers through the process.\n\nOur cabbages should be ready to harvest. I'll let you do the honors, of course!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Harvest 2 EZ-Gro Green Cabbages from your field and bring them to Farmer Yoon in Sunsong Ranch.",
    "CompletionText": "Look at those... err, what do they say around here? Oh yeah, b'yoots!\n\nLook at those b'yoots!\n\nI think I'm getting the hang of this farmer thing.",
    "RewardText": "Well, those are the basics!\n\nTill the soil, plant the seeds, tend to any threats, then wait for the results!\n\nToday was easy, but stay on your toes: my grandfather told me all kinds of crazy stories about farming at Sunsong Ranch.\n\nFarming ain't all giant turnips and roses, you know.",
