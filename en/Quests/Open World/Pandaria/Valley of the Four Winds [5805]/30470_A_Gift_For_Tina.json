She's really nice, but she's really hard to get gifts for!\n\nThere's a little jewel that can be found in the cliffs to the north. It's called a chrysoberyl, and it changes color when you hold it. I'll bet she doesn't have one of THOSE!\n\nLook inside the virmen caves. I bet you'll find one really fast.",
