    "Description": "Many have perished here. We will need to honor them properly, which means gathering the makings of incense of life. \n\nIt doesn't just smell nice - it has restorative properties, and can even help plants grow. Maybe I can get a whiff of the ingredients to get me back on my feet.\n\nThe materials can be found on creatures around here - except for the spices, which were stolen by the mercenaries who pillaged the village. ",
