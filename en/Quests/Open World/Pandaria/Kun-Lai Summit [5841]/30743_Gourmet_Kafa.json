    "Description": "It was genius: kafa berries go in the goot, seeds come out.\n\nKafa'kota is already rare and worth a fortune, but my invention--Kafa'goot--is GOURMET.\n\nBut it's over now. Uncle is upset and peak is a muss. All that's left is to collect the rest of the Kafa'goot and never make it again.\n\nI won't ask you to gather it--kind of a mussy task, not fit for hero-- just mark it so I can find it easily when the mountain is safe again.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Mark 15 Kafa'goot \"Deposits\" on Kota Peak.",
    "CompletionText": "On the bright side, Uncle Keenbean can label the last batch of Kafa'goot as \"Limited Release\" and sell it for even more!",
    "RewardText": "Great, I'll get up there and... harvest them soon.\n\n<Cousin Gootfur begins wrapping long strips of linen around his hands.>\n\nCan't believe I thought this was a good idea.",
