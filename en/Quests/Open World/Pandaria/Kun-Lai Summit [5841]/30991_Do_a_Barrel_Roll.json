    "Title": "Do a Barrel Roll!",
    "Description": "When I trained as a Brewmaster, I didn't expect to use my knowledge like this...\n\nDid you know beer catches fire when lit? Well, with yaungol oil mixed in, it's downright explosive.\n\nI've mixed the oil in with these kegs. Roll them at the yaungol over by the gate, and ignite them when you get close. \n\nIt'll take a few seconds for the keg to blow, but when it does...\n\nWell, let's just say I wouldn't want to be over there.\n\nWhich is why I'll be over here. Mourning the loss of this brew.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Pick up a keg near Lao-Chin, roll it downhill at the yaungol, and ignite it near them to destroy 4 Osul Treelaunchers and 50 Osul Invaders.",
    "CompletionText": "Wha? I was just thinking about my poor, poor beer...",
    "RewardText": "Whoo, that was an explosion! Several, in fact.\n\nSad my beer had to go, but at least we're safe, for now.",
