    "RewardText": "What we know of Lei Shen are dark legends that have been remembered over the vast span of time. I often wondered if these legends had exaggerated the power of Lei Shen. But your research would suggest they may have greatly underestimated the Thunder King. These are dark days indeed.\n\nWe will add this knowledge to your collection.
