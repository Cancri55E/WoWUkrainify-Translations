There are so many things to remember for fishin', I just can't keep it all in my head.\n\nThose reeds along the river look alright for makin' a pole out of. If you'd gather me some number of them, I'd be willin' to think on you favorably when it comes time to price my merchandise. Oh, and I'll pay you too, of course. \n\nHow's that sound?",
