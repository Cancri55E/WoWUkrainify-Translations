    "Description": "Kota Peak is famous for its kafa bushes - no other can survive at this elevation.\n\nGrummles make very good living selling Kafa'kota Blend, but it's dangerous now thanks to our cousin. He's got the wildlife up there hooked on kafa with his scheming.\n\nKafa'kota is more scarce than ever with goots gobblin' it up and yetis hoarding it in their caves.\n\nUncle Keenbean will pay you good for any berries you bring down from Kota.\n\nHere, take a sample. Eat it. See for yourself the power of kafa.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 100 Kafa'kota Berries from Kota Peak. They can be found in bushes growing on the mountainside or piled up in the yeti caves.",
