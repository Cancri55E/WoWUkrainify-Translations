    "Description": "First... before the war-cries... we heard the trees.\n\nGroaning, creaking, and finally crashing down as the mogu cut their way through the woods.

Those ruins have been empty for years - our children play there.\n\nWhy would the mogu come back to them now?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Follow the path of fallen trees from the northwest corner of Nectarbreeze Orchard and find the mogu raiders camp.",
