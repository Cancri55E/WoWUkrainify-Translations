    "Description": "We originally welcomed the Alliance as friends. Several of our villagers volunteered to help them build an airstrip. Only recently, however, did it become clear to us that they were building a war base, within shouting distance of our village.\n\nWhat's worse - I fear that some villagers are being held against their will. If you find them, $c, let them know that it is time to come home.",
