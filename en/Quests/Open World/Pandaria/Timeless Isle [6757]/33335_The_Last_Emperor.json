    "Title": "The Last Emperor",
    "Description": "From what I have gathered, this place used to be a tournament ground of sorts, where warriors from throughout Pandaria would show their prowess by following in the footsteps of their last emperor, Shaohao.\n\nI have heard that when Shaohao completed his trials, he became one with the land, and enveloped Pandaria in a thick mist, obscuring it from even our abilities to penetrate the passages of time.\n\nThat sounds quite interesting, perhaps you should speak with him?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak with Emperor Shaohao.",
    "RewardText": "In my pride, I sought to keep Pandaria a secret, and once again I have found myself learning great lessons from this land. I am glad to be able to share my stories with my people, once again, in that they may learn as I have, and learn from my mistakes. Perhaps you, too, can still learn a thing or two from the lessons of Pandaria.",
