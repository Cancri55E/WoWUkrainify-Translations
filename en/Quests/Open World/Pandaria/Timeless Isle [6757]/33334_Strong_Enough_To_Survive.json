    "Description": "An island lost in time and yet it returns flourishing with life!\n\nWhere did this island travel to? Did it simply hop forward in time, or did it languish in the dark reaches of the Twisting Nether?\n\nThere is one thing for certain: the creatures that inhabit this place are far more than they seem. I sense a hidden power in them, forged by the eons. Seek out the champions of their species, duly marked by their power and prowess, and vanquish five such creatures.\n\nIn death, we may find the clues we seek.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Defeat five Rare or Rare Elite creatures on the Timeless Isle.",
    "RewardText": "An interesting story of combat and bravery, though I fear that we learned little from your endeavors save that you are quite the adventurer. It seems that we find ourselves at an impasse with each twist and turn of this tale. Time is a fickle mistress.\n\nYou may wish to spend some time honing your skills here, before the sun sets.",
