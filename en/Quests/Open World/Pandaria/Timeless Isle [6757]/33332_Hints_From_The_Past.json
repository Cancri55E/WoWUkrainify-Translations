    "Description": "There is much to learn of this place, yet it does not yield its secrets willingly.\n\nSomething you mentioned the last time that we spoke intrigues me. This Mistweaver Ai, she carries a time-worn journal, if I recall? This may be the answer to many of our questions, or it may simply raise more. I suppose that it all depends on the diligence of the explorer that put pen to paper in this preposterous place.\n\nObtain a time-worn journal and return to me with it. We shall delve into its mysteries together.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Purchase a Time-Worn Journal from Mistweaver Ai.",
    "CompletionText": "Ah, you have returned. Do you have the journal?",
    "RewardText": "Ah, you have it! Excellent!\n\nA cursory glance indicates that my presumptions were not far-fetched. Though the pages are worn and waterlogged, most of the entries are still legible. It appears that our friend, explorer Harrington, was quite verbose in cataloguing the creatures and treasures he found on his journey through the island.\n\nWell, are you simply going to stand there? This tome is a veritable trove of mysteries, and we have barely scratched the surface! Adventure awaits!",
