He'll require a special diet to ensure that he does not outgrow the capacity to control his own body.\n\nMushan tongue is rich in the nutrients that promote brain growth in kunchong, but they normally eat the beasts whole and fill up quickly. If we feed Kovok only mushan tongues every couple of days or so, it should balance out his growth.\n\nGreatback mushan graze the hills east of here, near the Gurthani Terrace.",
