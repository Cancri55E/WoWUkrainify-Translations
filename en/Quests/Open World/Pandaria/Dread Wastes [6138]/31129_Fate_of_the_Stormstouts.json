    "Description": "$p! It is so great to see you healthy, and traveling so far. It would seem that our paths are quite tightly intertwined.\n\nI'm here looking for my family. I am told that several Stormstouts came across the wall to help face the mantid threat. I mean to find them, and join them.\n\nHave you seen anyone named Stormstout come through here? Would you mind helping me ask around?",
