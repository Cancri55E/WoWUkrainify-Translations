    "Description": "There is a champion among the loyalists, Vess-Guard Na'kal, whose strength comes not from experience or development, but from genetic modification. He was meant to be an example of the future of mantid - the sick idea that we can be born strong, without earning it.\n\nHe's a mockery of my work! Gene augmentation was meant for mature, post-swarm veterans ONLY!\n\nEnd him. Perhaps it will serve as a lesson to Grand Empress Shek'zeer that taking shortcuts leads to ruin.",
