    "Description": "Facing a living opponent is a very different thing from the stationary targets in the yard. Living opponents strike back. There is the very real fear of failure, and sometimes, even death.\n\nYou must have the courage to overcome those fears.\n\nChallenge the other trainees within the temple or down the steps below, and defeat them.",
