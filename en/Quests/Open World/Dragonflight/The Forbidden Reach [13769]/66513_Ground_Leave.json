    "Description": "Perhaps we should get an idea of this city, if it is to be our new home. A scouting mission, if you will.\n\nGo, see what this place has to offer. I will follow Wrathion and attempt to help in any way I can.\n\nTry not to upset the locals any more than you must, though. I doubt many of them are used to seeing dragons walk among them.\n\nMeet up with us once you've gotten the lay of the land.",
