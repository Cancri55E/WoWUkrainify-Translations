    "Description": "Now that the fight is done, you ask me to report in to Emberthal. Does Azurathel expect me to follow her commands?\n\nI think not.\n\nThe Ebon Scales answer only to the Earth-Warder. And thus far, I have received no orders from Neltharion.\n\n<Sarkareth glowers.>\n\nStill, I am not blind to the threat these Primalists represent.
