Work quickly--the effect will not last long, so you may have to reapply it.\n\nIf any of my people yet draw breath, save them.\n\nAnd if they do not, I ask that you recover their horn signets so that their names may be honored.\n\nWhile inside, perhaps you can find evidence of how this infestation came to be.",
