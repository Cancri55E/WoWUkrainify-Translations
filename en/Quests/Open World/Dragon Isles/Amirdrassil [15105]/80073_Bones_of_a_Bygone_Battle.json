    "Description": "After speaking with the warden, I learned the Battle of the Barrier where my sister fell took place east of here, on the shores of the Ohn'ahran Plains. \n \nI understand her body was washed out to sea and never recovered.\n \nIt's possible the tide brought her remains back to shore at some point. Will you help me look for her? \n\nEach member of my family has a necklace with this distinct design. It will identify Koroleth's body.\n\nI would like to lay her to rest with the family she loved.",
