    "Description": "The legend says she only sings it for those who prove their devotion to life.\n\nI've been tending this garden for years... And I think my plants and I are finally ready.\n\nI'll start setting up by the pool here. You can help me with the harvest!\n\nGather seed pods from beneath bushes, dragonflowers from sunny fields, and dragonfruit high in the trees. You can borrow my old rake to help with those. And watch out--sometimes the foliage can be feisty!",
