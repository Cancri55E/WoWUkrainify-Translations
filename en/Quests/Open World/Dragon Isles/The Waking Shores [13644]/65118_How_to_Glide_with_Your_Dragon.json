    "Description": "Let us start with the basics.\n\nIf you fly straight you will wear yourself out right now. Use gravity as an aid and aim slightly down to fly a long distance. The rings will give you the general angle that you should use for basic gliding.\n\nFirst, call upon your drake.\n\nThen, fly through the rings and land at the target location.\n\nIf you find yourself stuck, use the Bronze Timepiece and Celormu will reset you.",
