    "Description": "Let us start with the basics.\n\nIf you fly straight you will wear yourself out right now. Use gravity as an aid and aim slightly down to fly a long distance. The rings will give you the general angle that you should use for basic gliding.\n\nFirst, call upon your drake, or our Red Drake friend here can give you a lift.\n\nThen, fly through the rings and land at the target location.\n\nIf you find yourself stuck, use the Bronze Timepiece and Celormu will reset you.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Summon your skyriding mount, or mount the Red Drake. Then glide through the rings and land in the target area.",
