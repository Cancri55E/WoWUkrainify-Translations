    "Description": "Cadet Sendrax has informed me of our majordomo's plans. Thank the Life-Binder that we have their help. Their interference gives us the reprieve we need to get our wounded back to the Life Pools to be treated.\n\nI wish I could reinforce Selistra but I must keep my guards near the wounded. Go to the enemy stronghold to meet them. \n\nIf there were another way of handling the djaradin, I would ask it. But, as it were...\n\nYou must do what you must.",
