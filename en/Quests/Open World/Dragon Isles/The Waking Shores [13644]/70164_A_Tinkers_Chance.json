    "Description": "If you have a moment, $p, I am close to a breakthrough!\n\nAfter the creche collapsed, I lost more than my ability to fight. I lost my identity as a dracthyr. Perhaps you can understand.\n\nI have always enjoyed putting things together and taking them apart, so Expedition seemed like a good fit for me. But this artifact is giving me some trouble.\n\nWould you ask Phosildral and Sibrit to review my notes? I want to prove I am a capable tinker... to them and to myself.",
