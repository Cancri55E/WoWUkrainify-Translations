    "Description": "Toddy and Naleidea have requested a survey report of the surrounding area immediately.\n\nLuckily, I have acquired an enchanted telescope and surveyor's disc that will help us scout out nearby areas from the safety of the clouds.\n\nUnluckily, I am deathly afraid of heights and cannot bring myself to set foot on the contraption.\n\nYou are not afraid of heights, are you?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Use the Surveyor's Disc to bounce into the sky and scout the area.",
    "RewardText": "<Aster breathes a sigh of relief.>\n\nI thought for certain you would plummet to your death from up there. Thanks again for taking the risk so that I was not required to.",
