    "Description": "What could be better than a meal you can carry while you explore?\n\nStreet foods are the essence of busy cities this great world over. But not every meal is set for mobility. The core of great on-the-go cuisines is a starch that will hold strong while moving. Breads, potatoes, rices, and beyond are the heart of hand-sized dining.\n\nI would like to treat my Pandaren peer here to a flavorful specimen known as Leapmaize. Morsel introduced it to me when we first met near the titan ruins in the Waking Shores.",
