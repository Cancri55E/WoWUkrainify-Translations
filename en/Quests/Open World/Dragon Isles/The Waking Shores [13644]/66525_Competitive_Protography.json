    "Description": "Well, now that you've cut your teeth on some starter shots, how about we move onto something a little spicier?\n\nI spotted a gorgeous proto-drake flying around the area behind us. Beautiful horns, scales crackling with electricity... Probably the work of the Primalists, no doubt, but art is art!\n\nSee if you can get a picture of the proto-drake and some of its eggs. You might have to climb up a bit to get a good shot!",
