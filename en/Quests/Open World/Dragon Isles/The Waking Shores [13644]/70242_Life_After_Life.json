Something in this place reopened it--perhaps so that it could heal cleanly this time.\n\nNow it is Kolgar's time to heal.\n\nIn the terrace above us, you will find my friend Trellain working with the enchanters. Tell him that I require one of the vessels he uses in his work. He will give it to you freely.",
