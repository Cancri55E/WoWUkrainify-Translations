    "Description": "The wounded are stabilized, but something still troubles me, $n.\n\nA pair of dragonspawn ecologists had come to the outpost to study the wetlands. I haven't seen scale nor claw of them since the attack, and it's become worrisome.\n\nIf you're venturing out, would you mind keeping an eye out, and making sure they're safe?\n\nAnd do take care. Rumor has it those wetlands are gorloc-infested.",
