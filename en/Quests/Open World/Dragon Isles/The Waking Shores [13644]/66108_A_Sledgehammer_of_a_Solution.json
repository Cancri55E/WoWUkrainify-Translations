    "Description": "While I'm glad Tharu now sees my point of view, I'm also grateful he had you rescue wildlife while I was dawdling.\n\nThe situation is much more dire than anticipated; he was right to take action. With what we've learned, I fear this elemental bombardment won't stop until we've dealt with the gorlocs.\n\nIf I were Tharu and thinking actionably, I would go straight for their leaders. Without anyone to rally around, the fighting should dissipate and no longer threaten the wetlands.",
