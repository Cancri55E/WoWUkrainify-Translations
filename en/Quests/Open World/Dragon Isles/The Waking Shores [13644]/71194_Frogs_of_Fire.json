    "Description": "I found a perfect spot for a fishing net, one problem bothers me though... Those Hornspikes. I'm pretty sure they will ravage the nets as soon as it's left alone. What do we do?\n\n...I've got an idea. We treat our lava fishing nets with Icicle Brew to make them heat-resistant. We just need to teach those hornspikes to keep away from that smell.\n\nToss a flask of Icicle Brew at a hornspike, and then deal some damage to them. Just make sure not to kill them, they won't learn if they're dead, would they?",
