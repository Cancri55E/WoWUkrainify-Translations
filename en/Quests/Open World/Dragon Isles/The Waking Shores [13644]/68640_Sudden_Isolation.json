    "Description": "We used to trade frequently with the Uktulut tribe in the Waking Shores, but they haven't been sending or accepting shipments for months now. Our letters have gone unanswered. Naturally, we suspect the worst.\n\nTheir chieftain, Tutaqan, has always been the reasonable sort. Somewhat prone to strong emotions, but I can't imagine anything terrible could have happened under his leadership.\n\nCould you please check on them? If they need help, we'll happily provide.",
