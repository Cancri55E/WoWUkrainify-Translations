So must we all when it comes time.\n\nI am afraid that it is age that ails him and not illness, but I may be able to relieve some portion of his suffering.\n\nWould you mind gathering some snapflowers, shallowlilies, and pure water from the garden nearby? I can create a pain medicine with these components, if you find enough.",
