I'll remember that trick!\n\nSince you've been helpful so far, I'll do you the honor of letting you test out some authentic Uktulut weaponry. You'll find no sharper blade or sturdier haft this side of the Dragon Isles.\n\nGo test this out in our training area for me. Maybe it'll remind the chieftain what real fighting looks like! Ha!",
