    "Description": "I do not know what to say. I had no idea that the chieftain's pain ran so deep.\n\nIt makes sense. Ottuks are not pets to our people--especially not to hunters like our chieftain. They are our friends, our companions... and members of our families.\n\nIpko was Tutaqan's first and only ottuk. Uktulut hunters hold this bond to be sacred.\n\nI will see that her passage to the place of our ancestors is a peaceful one.",
