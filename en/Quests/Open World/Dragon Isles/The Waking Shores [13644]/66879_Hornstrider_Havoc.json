    "Description": "Hornstriders! They've got bone-breaking beaks, fast legs for getting away from danger, and they can eat anything in the Isles.\n\nThis Calling's the easiest around! It's just me and my favorite big birds spending time together. And if anything comes up, I know how to wrangle all of the Isles' critters.\n\nWould you mind following me to the hornstrider plateaus up north? I wouldn't mind an extra pair of hands while getting set up.",
