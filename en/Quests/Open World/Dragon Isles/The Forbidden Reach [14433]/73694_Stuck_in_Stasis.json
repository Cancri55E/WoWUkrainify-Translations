    "Description": "When the first dracthyr awakened from millennia of slumber, we left the Forbidden Reach for the Dragon Isles. Yet not all of the dracthyr are free. Some are still in stasis, hidden deep within their creches.\n\nWe need your help. Travel to Froststone Vault. See if you can find more of our friends. One of my Healing Wings would be glad to accompany you. Choose someone who best suits your need.\n\nIt is time for all dracthyr to rejoin the world as we have.",
