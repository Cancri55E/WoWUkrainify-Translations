    "Description": "Tacha's big ears heard some noise in one of the tunnels. We took a peek inside. I'm not going to lie: it's grim in there. Pretty terrifying. All sorts of horrible creatures. Not the sort of thing Tacha and I usually deal with up close.\n\nYou have experience dealing with monsters, right? Excellent. You go first. Don't worry. Once it's safe, we'll come in and join you. Really, it's the least we can do.",
