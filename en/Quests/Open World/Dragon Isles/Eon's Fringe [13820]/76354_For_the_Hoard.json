    "Description": "I have a storage vault in the Passage of Time chock-full of chronomatic crates. They contain timelost artifacts from various timelines.\n\nUnfortunately, me safeguard protocols on the vault itself were damaged by those blasted time rifts. I did a quick fly-about and saw those infernal looters scattering my crates everywhere!\n\nSince you're heading that way, can you grab some of my possessions as you go? Not all of them, of course! Just the important stuff.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Find and collect Ironus's artifacts.",
    "CompletionText": "I swear by the heat of me forge, if any of those retched looters broke into me crates and took anything, I'm going to...\n\nWell, we bronze dragons have all sorts of techniques, don't we?",
    "RewardText": "Oh, thank the timeways. You found me stuff!\n\n<Ironus hurriedly examines his possessions.>\n\nTo some these relics may seem like rubbish, but to me? They're all treasures.\n\nOh and don't worry about the rest of the crates. Once these time rifts are dealt with, I'll head on over and get them back in the vault.",
