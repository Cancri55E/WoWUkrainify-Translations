    "Description": "If I'm to repair young Finduin's blade here, then we need to crack open this timelock on me forge. And if a hammer can break a lock, then I'm betting a chronohammer can break a timelock.\n\nUnfortunately, my hammer's a wee bit out of sync. But we're in the prime sort of mishap to fix that. Nearby rifts are tearing into our timeline just outside the Temporal Conflux and out-of-time uglies are pouring through.\n\nHead out of Eon's Fringe, clear the area, and recharge my hammer.",
