    "Description": "Those grubby forgespawns knocked Finduin right over and took Seashellamayne! They must've sensed the temporal energies lingering on the sword.\n\nCan't imagine what they'd want with it, but there's no time to wait and see.\n\nEverything you've done won't mean much if I don't have Finduin's blade to fix. Could you fetch it for me? After all, the fate of Azmerloth depends on it!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Retrieve Finduin Wryngrrlgulgll's blade Seashellamayne.",
    "CompletionText": "Like time-moths to the chrono-flame, those wee elementals were drawn to Seashellamayne!\n\nI can only hope the damage done to it is minimal.",
    "RewardText": "Thank the timeways you retrieved Seashellamayne before those fiery creeps could cause lasting damage! The blade is a bit burnt, but nothing I can't hammer out\n\nGlad you're in one piece as well. A few char marks, I see, but nothing you couldn't handle.\n\nWear that soot like the badge of pride it is.",
