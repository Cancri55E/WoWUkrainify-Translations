    "Description": "It really is quite enticing, isn't it? The Locus was too much for the Sundered Flame. However, it fits just right in my hands. Funny, that.\n\n<Adenedal shakes his head.>\n\nPerhaps not. Not this day. Not again. Take it from me. It is not my burden to bear.\n\nGood bye, dear friend.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Bring the Black Locus to the Telemancer Aerilyn.",
    "RewardText": "This was found at the Nelthazan Ruins? Fascinating. \n\nIts markings are ancient, but they bear a resemblance to other artifacts we have discovered in and around the ancient machinations of Deathwing.\n\nFurther study is necessary.",
