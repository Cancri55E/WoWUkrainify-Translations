If we're to give you proper support against Rymek and his minions, we can't have our wings freezing off.\n\nI sense powerful Frost Cores nearby. They're probably sustaining this blizzard. If you can destroy them, we can take out Rymek's minions in short order.\n\nAnd Somnikus is out there too. He flew off for Rymek like a dragon possessed. We need to get to him as soon as we can.",
