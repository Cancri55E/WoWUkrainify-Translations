    "Description": "Due to the nature of our clan, some resources are in short supply. We do not have the luxury of time to claim the land's metal resources.\n\nThe late khan established multiple trade connections with a variety of individuals, and I see no reason to discontinue their services.\n\nThe nearby bay contains buckets where we catch whelks - they're considered a delicacy for some of our neighbors. Bring a collection back to me for use in trade.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 12 river whelks for Hadari.",
    "RewardText": "Ah, this will be helpful.\n\nIt is hard for me to rely on outsiders for such a key resource, but I cannot think of an alternate route.",
