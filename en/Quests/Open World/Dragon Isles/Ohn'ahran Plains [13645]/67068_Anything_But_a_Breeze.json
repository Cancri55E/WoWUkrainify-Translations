    "Description": "Breezehunters?! Oh, those falcons have been a problem. Just the other day, our stable master, Marren, almost fell to her death trying to tame one.\n\nShe's pretty proud, so she blamed it on the breezehunter itself. Told me that if it didn't think her eggs were being attacked, it wouldn't have been so aggressive as to bully her off the cliff's edge.\n\nI guess that means that you might find the eggs you're looking for out there? It was to the east, just around the mountainside here.",

    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Return to Rumiastrasza at The Ruby Feast in Valdrakken.",
    "CompletionText": "Looks like you made it back with a few scrapes as well as the egg!\n\nWorry not about your pride or anything of the like! Even a dragon of my size would not want to take on a nest of them alone.",
    "RewardText": "Glorious!\n\nMorsel and I will whip up a cake so divine your palette will swear it was in the afterlife. Imagine an experience that is lighter than air, tangy like a sunfruit, but with a crisp texture.\n\nPrepare to feel like a breezehunter yourself!",
