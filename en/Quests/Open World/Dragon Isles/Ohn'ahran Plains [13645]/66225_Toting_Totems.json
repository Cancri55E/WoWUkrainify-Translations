    "Description": "Boku asked why I sent a message calling all mystics to Ridgewater Retreat.\n\nI sent no such message. Balakar purposefully drew my mystics into a trap to cripple Clan Ohn'ir.\n\nBut there may be a second reason. The Nokhud are gathering mystic totems, as many as they can find. These totems are blessed by Ohn'ahra.\n\nThe Nokhud motives in this are unclear, but we cannot allow them to take Ohn'ahra's gifts. Recover as many totems as you can.",
