    "Description": "If there's anything I learned from my time out in the wilderness, it's that if you don't deal with an evil when you find it. If you don't break its bones and dig up its roots, it'll keep growing. And then it'll be harder to kill.\n\nThese mountains were plagued with Frostbite's existence when I was a young pup like you, and it will only get worse once he takes full control of the Snowhide tribe. \n\nI should have done something about him long ago, but we're the only ones who can right that mistake now.",
