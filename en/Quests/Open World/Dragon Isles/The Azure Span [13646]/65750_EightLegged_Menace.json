    "Description": "$C!\n\nI require your aid if you're willing...\n\nThis joint expedition was intended to study the unique arachnids inhabiting the area, but, as you can see, our plan has gone awry. \n\nWhat we originally assumed was an evolutionary adaptation is instead a Primalist perversion of the natural order!\n\nI take my responsibilities as a conservationist seriously, but the time for studying live specimens has passed. We can't let their perversion spread. We can study their corpses instead. \n\nWill you help us?",
