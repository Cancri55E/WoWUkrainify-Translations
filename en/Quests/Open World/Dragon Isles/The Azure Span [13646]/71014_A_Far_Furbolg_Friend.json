It says something about Frostbite that his pack beat him in a fight.\n\nLast I heard, Barst left for some island off the coast of Iskaara. Called it his \"retirement\" or some other garbage.\n\nTell Barst it's time to get back into action. \n\nOh, and don't be fooled by the way he talks. He'll tear you in two if you look at him wrong.",
