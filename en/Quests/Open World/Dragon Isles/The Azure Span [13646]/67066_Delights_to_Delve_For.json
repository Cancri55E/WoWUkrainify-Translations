Eating a fish with a dragon and duck chef duo sounds like the beginning of a tale Elder Poa might tell for the younglings. We'd be hard-pressed to forget such a happening!\n\nThe fish was a Savory Deviant Dealfish, a top Tuskarr favorite! They're rare, but found just off the coast here.\n\nFair warning - it's azuretooth mating season. Those bloodthirsty fiends will take a chunk out of you for messing with their favorite snack.",
