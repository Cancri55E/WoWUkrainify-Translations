    "Description": "I am glad that Winglord Dezran arrived when he did. If he had not, this would have gone... very differently.\n\nWe must take Marithos back to Valdrakken so he can recuperate, but once I have debriefed Dezran, we will send an envoy to help re-introduce them to our people.\n\nThey have suffered. We have suffered. Perhaps now we can all heal.\n\nFollow me back to Valdrakken. We have much to discuss.",
