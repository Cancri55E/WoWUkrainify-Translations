    "Description": "Greetings, $c. This magical dome is truly astonishing, is it not? But even though it protects us from the biting cold and the wilderness, we cannot count on the Kirin Tor forever.\n\nA few days ago, some of our most seasoned hunters ventured into the forests looking for food and supplies, but they never came back. Even though I know their leader, Old Grimtusk, is a seasoned hiker and hunter, it is very hard not to worry about him and his hunting party.\n\nCan you find them for me?",
