    "Description": "The hills ahead are littered with insidious bladejaw traps.\n\nWith a keen eye, you should be able to locate them. Very carefully spring the traps using this old tuskarr trick: a long stick. Note that while stepping on them is another way to set the traps off, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nOnce enough have been removed, find Hanu. Elder Poa and I will catch up when we can.",
