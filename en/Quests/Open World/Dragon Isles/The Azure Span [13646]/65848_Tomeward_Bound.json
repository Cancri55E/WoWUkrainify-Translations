    "Description": "We must stop that tree! With these ley crystals, I can finally help.\n\nSpeak with me when you are ready. I'll open a portal into the Azure Archives and try to bring out something useful. \n\nStand back, it may be rather unstable.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak with Kalecgos to open the portal, then use what he summons to take out the Brackenhide Putrifiers and then destroy the Twisted Ancient.",
    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Speak with Kalecgos inside the ley crystal cave.",
    "RewardText": "You did well, hero, thank you. \n\nThat tree was probably not their only pool of decay, but it was the riskiest one for the tuskarr and this ley line. With it gone, this area may be able to recover. It will take time, but it will heal. \n\nI'm glad we were able to give the spirits of those tuskarr some peace.",
