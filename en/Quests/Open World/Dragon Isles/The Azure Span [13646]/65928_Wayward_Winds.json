    "Description": "Bah! Work together, she says? \n\nBut... if the Gleamfisher believes there is a chance we can help the other tribes... we must try. \n\nFor the wind spirit Kraunot to acknowledge us, we will first have to tend to his element. The nearby wind elementals have been agitated ever since the land began to awaken.\n\nWhile I inspect this boat you two made, you go and fight to dismantle them, then bring me their restless motes. That should bring some calm back to the area.",
