If he falls, I won't be able to fend off Raszageth.\n\nThe empowered gem you hold should allow you to disguise yourself as an elemental to sneak ahead.\n\nUse the gem to destroy the orbs. That should give Kalecgos room to unleash his power.\n\nI will focus my attention on shielding the tower from Raszageth.",
