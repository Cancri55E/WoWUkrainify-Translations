Just the sort of well-armed individual I was hoping to encounter.\n\nI'm here in this literal backwater on very important Kirin Tor business, you see, and whilst I was beginning to set up my camp, I was chased off by filthy, mangy gnolls.\n\nIn fact, a rather concerning number of gnolls have gathered nearby, enough that I believe they pose a threat to the wider Span.\n\nFear not though, for I have a plan! Meet me in the lake just over there, and I'll explain everything.",
