    "Description": "Much is said about how decay spreads through the air and ground. But it also spreads through the water. \n\nSlimes that live in the rivers and streams ooze pestilence. The water is toxic with it. But if we wade in and kill the big one, the poison in the water will diminish.\n\nIt may poison me in the process, but I am going to kill one if it's the last thing I do. This place needs a purging. \n\nAre you with me, $n?",
