    "Description": "The last time I was in this cave, I sketched a massive flower that dripped a vile, viscous sap. It's one of my best drawings, I couldn't forget it if I tried.\n\nThat sap is what's stuck to these tarasek spears, I'm sure of it. They must have started harvesting it to envenom their weapons.\n\nThe plant is beautiful; it will be a shame to kill it. Still, we can't let the tarasek keep harvesting it. $n, please cull the plant and put a stop to this whole mess.",

    "PortraitGiverText": "A writhing mass of deadly vines. The local tarasek have taken to dipping their weapons in its venom.",
    "RewardText": "Thank you, $n. The Embertooth's venom harvesting days should be behind them now that they have been deprived of their source.\n\nI realize now that I don't have to be a Waywatcher to make a difference in the world. I am going to resign my post and commit myself to my art. Hopefully some day I will be able to depict the most beautiful vistas in the Dragon Isles, for all the world to see.\n\nI just hope my sister understands.",
