    "Description": "You did well to gather those spears and rope. With them, we can ensure those haughty Primalists will no longer rule the skies!\n\nThere is a platform up the stairway with several Siege Scorpions. If you use the rope to string their bows and use the spears as ammunition, you should be able to strike the Magmasworn's dragons in the air!\n\nOnce cleared, the path up the spire will be safe and we can continue our search for Commander Eranog.",
