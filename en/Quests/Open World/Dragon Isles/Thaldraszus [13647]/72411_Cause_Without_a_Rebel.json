    "Description": "Good to see you again, $n! Alexstrasza doesn't think we can stop the rebels effectively through force, despite the successes you've had.\n\nTo find other ways forward, Alexstrasza has called Maldra Flametongue here to talk about the rebellion and what drew her to it.\n\nPerhaps it would be helpful to join the conversation, and see what Maldra has to say. To avoid prying rebel eyes and ears, they will be meeting below us, on the second level of the Seat of the Aspects.",
