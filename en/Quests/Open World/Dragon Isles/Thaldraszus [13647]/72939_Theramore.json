    "Description": "According to Azuregos's notes, the blue dragon Surigosa was last seen investigating a sect of rogue mages known as the Sullied Banner. \n\nSurigosa's last missive stated that she intended to travel to the ruins of Theramore. Perhaps she uncovered traces of the Sullied Banner there. Either way, if Surigosa is to be found, Theramore seems the best place to search for her.",
