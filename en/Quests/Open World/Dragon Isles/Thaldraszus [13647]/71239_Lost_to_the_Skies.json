    "Description": "I need a favor, and you look like the favor-doing type.\n\nAn ol' pal of mine, Harleen Chirpsnide, was supposed to meet me in the city a few days ago. We was planning to eat our way through The Ruby Feast, get a trim at the barbershop, then visit that swanky auction house they got here.\n\nBut she ain't shown up. She gets lost in her work plenty, but I'd feel a lot more comfortable knowing where she was.\n\nTry the mountains south of here. She mentioned she'd be swinging by on her way in.",
