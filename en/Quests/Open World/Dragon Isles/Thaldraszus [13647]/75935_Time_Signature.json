    "Description": "Oh good, an adventurer. You've heard of Pedgi, I presume? The composer?\n\nNo? Well, don't tell him that.\n\nWe were traveling to research his next song, when we stumbled upon a dragon named Tempo. Pedgi is now convinced they're the only one who can help us. \n\nYes, because of the name. That's really all it takes for him.\n\nBut Tempo here is, understandably, too busy to help us. Could you talk to them? See if we can help clear their schedule?",
    "ObjectivesText": "See if Tempo would be willing to help Pedgi with his music.",
    "RewardText": "Thanks for talking to Tempo.\n\nPedgi can be temperamental, but his heart is in the right place. Most of the time.",
