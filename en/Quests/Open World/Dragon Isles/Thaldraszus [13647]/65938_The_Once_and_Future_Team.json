Are you ready for a huge tug-of-war match with time itself?\n\nYank at the door's bubble like you did with the crystals earlier. But be careful, all the time energy released is sure to collect and attack you. I'm not sure what will be there, but at least you'll have the freed Wardens on your side no matter what happens.\n\nGood luck, $n!",
