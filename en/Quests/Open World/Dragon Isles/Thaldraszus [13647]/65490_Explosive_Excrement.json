    "Description": "The harpies are a nice surprise and all, but I came to these mountains for one reason and one reason only: EXCREMENT!\n\nSpecifically, the excrement of bluefeather rocs that's then been eaten and digested by bugs. Scarab stomach juices enhance the explosive nitrogen content by tenfold! At least!\n\nHere, take this Chirpsnide Auto-Excre-Collector. Stomp on the scarabs crawling around the cave floor, and use the Collector to reap the rewards.\n\nBring it back full and we can start the real fun: EXPLOSIONS!!",
