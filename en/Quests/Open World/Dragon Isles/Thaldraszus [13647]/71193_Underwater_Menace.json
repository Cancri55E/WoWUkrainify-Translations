    "Description": "Did you see that? Underwater! A huge, armored, hungry beast! No way I'm getting near water with my net while that monstrosity lurks below. If you want, you can likely lure it out with a handful of Ominous Conches. Those shouldn't be too hard to catch.\n\nTo gain conchs, be sure to have your Iskaaran Harpoon handy as you fish in the Dragon Isles.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Use 5 Ominous Conches in the Tyrhold Fishing Hole to summon a huge underwater beast, and bring back something as a proof of its demise.\n\nYou may unlock only one extra fishing net per day.",
