    "Description": "Legends speak of an ale brewed by Neltharion himself. Yet this ale has been lost to the ages! If those stories are true, and doubtless they are, we may find the recipe within this vault. \n\nIpfelkofer and I found three keys to this vault, so we decided to look around. Hopefully, our thirst for discovery will be quenched.\n\nIf we found that recipe, imagine the excitement in the brewing community! We could even feature that ale at the next Brewfest! First round will be on me.",
