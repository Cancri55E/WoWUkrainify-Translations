All three were quite eager to speak of your contributions and aid in Zaralek Cavern as well. It seems that they are also in agreement that they could not have succeeded without you.\n\nHigh praise indeed--and well deserved.\n\nPlease, stay for a little longer. The other Aspects and I have matters to discuss, and I believe you should be here as well.",
