    "Description": "Enjoying the greenery around our little scenery, $n?\n\nIt reminds me of a dish I once tasted from a pair of dryad sisters and their kind treant friend. Sugarbough was their name! A resident of Shady Sanctuary on the western coast of the Plains.\n\nIt was a medley of fresh herbs, veggies, and spices. At the heart of this dish was the most delicious layer of sea kelp you have ever tasted!\n\nWhat? Never tasted sea kelp before? Well you simply must seek some out. And bring back enough to share, please!",
