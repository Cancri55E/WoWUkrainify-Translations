    "Description": "Much of the Dream's wildlife is feathered or furred. Their shed, whether it be down fur or feathers, is reputed to be extremely durable, soft, and fashionable.\n\nThe great somnowls' feathers are particularly desirable. They don't shed often, and feathers are quickly retrieved by local wildlife for nest building.\n\nI've heard that your best chance is scouring the Meandering Rootlands in the Dream.",
