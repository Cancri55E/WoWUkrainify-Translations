    "Description": "The notes you found, combined with Merithra's reconnaissance, have revealed Ashendir's plan. The flame wards that surround the Wellspring Temple are blocking our reinforcements.\n\nOur allies will distract Fyrakk while you and I slip behind enemy lines to destroy the wards.\n\nThe skies are filled with drakes, and I must fend them off. Once you find a flame ward and thin out its defenses, signal me to destroy it.",
