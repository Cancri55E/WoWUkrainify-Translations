    "Description": "Since the dragons returned, we've seen an overwhelming number of outsiders passing through the plains. Normally we keep a close eye on our borders, but their sheer numbers, combined with the Nokhud threat, have made it difficult to track them.\n\nOne scout reported a group of outsiders that matched your description traveling along the eastern road. We should start our search there.\n\nAs for your friend, my khan gave me a command. A huffy companion won't stop me from carrying it out.",
