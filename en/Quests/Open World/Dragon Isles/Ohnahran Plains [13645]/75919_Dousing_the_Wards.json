    "Description": "Fyrakk and Vyranoth are already here. I spotted them near the overlook at the northeastern edge of Lunedane. Landing close to their location would reveal our presence, thus we are forced to begin our mission here. \n\nHowever, the bridge connecting this area to the overlook has been protected with fire magic. We will not be able to break through it.\n\nFyrakk's Primalist allies appear to be maintaining the fire using wards set up around this area. \n\nIf we destroy the wards, the fire should subside.",
