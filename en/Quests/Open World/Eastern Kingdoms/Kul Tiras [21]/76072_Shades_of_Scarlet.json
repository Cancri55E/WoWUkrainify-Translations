Yet...  my wife's spirit is missing. It is as though she never existed.\n\nHallow's End draws the shades that haunt the Monastery out from the shadows. Trapped in the past, they walk the grounds repeating their nightmares.\n\nWith any luck, one of them might give us answers as to what happened to her.",
