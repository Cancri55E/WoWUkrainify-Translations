He hates that someone like me can make more money than him.\n\nBelieve it or not, I play the auction house fairly. I'm a saint compared to him!\n\nSo Grub sold my crystals, eh? And then paid Arty to lie about them so no one would go looking for them. A fine plan.\n\nGrub must have something valuable on that ship of his. Well we're going to go take it. Search the ship thoroughly.",
