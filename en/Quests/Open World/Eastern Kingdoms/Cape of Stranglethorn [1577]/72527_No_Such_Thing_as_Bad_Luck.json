    "Description": "Look, believe it or not, I'd be in the Isles already if it wasn't for unfinished business. Recent events have not been kind to me. I owe the Baron, and nobody owes the Baron for long. He will absolutely find and skin me if I don't pay up.\n\nI invested his money in these magic crystals, but their price just crashed on the market because of the front page ripper in the Booty Bay Journal. And the shipment of crystals is missing!\n\nSomeone must be plotting my demise. Perhaps the Goodstitches will help me.",
