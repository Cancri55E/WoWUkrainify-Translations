I must rest, but please $p... go and see this through. Bring Madam Shadow to account. Avenge our fellow warlocks.",

That I would be sacrificing a part of myself. A part of how my people see me. \n\nBut to have your soul torn asunder... for what? Petty revenge?\n\nTruly that is a fate worse than anything I have taken upon myself.",
