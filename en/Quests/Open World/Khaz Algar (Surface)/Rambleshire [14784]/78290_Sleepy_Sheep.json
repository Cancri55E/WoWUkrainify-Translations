    "Description": "The energized moss that these flocks produce is a favorite treat for the storm rooks. But with the storm gone, the rams are lethargic, vulnerable, and no longer producing.\n\nWe may not be able to conjure a storm, but we could offer the mosswools a motivating zap. See if you can find a lodestone that will hold a charge. Then bring it here to Shraubendre so she can get it loaded up.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Use an Energized Lodestone to rouse 1 Lethargic Mosswools near Rambleshire.",
    "CompletionText": "The lodestone should hold just enough of a charge to give the mosswools the motivation they need to return to their corrals. It won't hurt them.",
    "RewardText": "The mosswools look like they have a bit more pep. Hopefully they'll start producing again soon, if the storm comes back, that is.\n\nRancher Stenspor believes he knows why the storm is missing. He claims two legendary ram brothers re-energize the storm once a year. Just not this year, for some reason.",
