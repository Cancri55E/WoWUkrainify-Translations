    "Description": "You say nerubians had him? Not sure what they wanted with old Durzan, but he looks weakened by the ordeal. We can't have that if he's to challenge his brother Belzt on the mountain.\n\nThe moss harvested from our flocks gives the storm rooks a kick, so Durzan might benefit from it as well. Collect a bushel's worth and make an offering.\n\nAnd if the mosswools get ornery, be sure to put them in their place.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Harvest moss from Rambleshire Mosswools and feed it to Durzan.",
    "CompletionText": "That moss captures and contains the power of the storm. It ought to give Durzan the boost he needs to get back up on that mountain.",
    "RewardText": "That seemed to do the trick. I think he's ready to return to his brother on Thunderhead Peak.",
