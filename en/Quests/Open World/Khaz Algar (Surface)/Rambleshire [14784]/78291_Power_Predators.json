    "Title": "Power Predators",
    "Description": "Thunderhead Peak normally boasts a perpetual storm from which the local mosswools draw energy. Without it, the poor dears look to be listless and near dead on their feet. That makes them easy pickings for predators.\n\nTo get moss production back on track, we'll need to get to the bottom of the missing storm. But first we need to beat back these predators before they turn the mosswools to gravel.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Cull 10 predators around Rambleshire.",
    "CompletionText": "Please do what you can for the poor mosswools.",
    "RewardText": "That should buy the ranchers and their flocks some time while we figure out what's going on with the missing storm. No storm means no moss, which means grumpy storm rooks.\n\nAccording to the locals, the storm is born of two legendary rams butting heads atop Thunderhead Peak. They think one of them went missing, if you can believe that.",
