But Baelgrim...\n\n<Adelgonn pauses to compose herself.>\n\nHe was infuriatingly rigid and we argued ceaselessly, but in the end... he was a defender of our people--all of them.\n\nBaelgrim sacrificed himself to vouchsafe the Isle of Dorn from the nerubians. Everyone needs to know that--and we can't let the nerubians force our hand like that again.\n\nGo back to Merrix in Dornogal. Tell him we will come soon. We just... need a moment here.",
