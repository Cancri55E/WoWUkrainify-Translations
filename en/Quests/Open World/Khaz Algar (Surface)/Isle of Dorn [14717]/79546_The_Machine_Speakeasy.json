    "Title": "The Machine Speakeasy",
    "Description": "Machine Speakers are odd and secretive units, some prone to paranoia. \n\nEven so, the grievance they have against Steelvein must be smoothed over.\n\nAs you have seen in the Forgegrounds, their quarrel with a single smuggler has put the entire city at risk. As Councilward, I will not stand for it.\n\nLet us go talk to Ardgrin's employee, Obstorn, and see if he can deliver a diplomatic message to his overseer in the Deeps.\n\nI will meet you in the tunnels.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Enter the speakeasy in the tunnels below Dornogal then confront Obstorn.",
    "PortraitGiverName": "Obstorn",
    "PortraitGiverText": "Merrix believes this feud can be solved peacefully and without conflict.",
    "CompletionText": "I would have us exchange words, not blows.",
    "RewardText": "I abhor violence, $n.\n\nDissent. Desperation. Distrust. These are the consequences of ruling through fear.\n\n<Merrix frowns for a moment before glancing down at Obstorn.>\n\nBut, sometimes, violence brings about clarity--and with it, revelations.",
