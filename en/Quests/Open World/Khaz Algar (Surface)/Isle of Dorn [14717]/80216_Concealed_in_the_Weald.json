Many of them are guarding the mill, but I am sure there are more than we can see.\n\nWe cannot allow such a large enemy force to operate unimpeded this close to Rambleshire.\n\nThe nerubians attacked and destroyed large sections of Dornogal not too long ago. The Order of Night Arathi are abducting and enslaving our people.\n\nWe must eliminate as many of them as we can. Preferably all of them.",
