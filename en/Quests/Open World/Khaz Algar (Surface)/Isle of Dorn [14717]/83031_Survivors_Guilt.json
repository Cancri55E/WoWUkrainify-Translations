Again.\n\nSo much loss and so much pain. Friends and comrades gone in an instant, their voices silenced by Xal'atath. \n\n<He takes a deep breath, steeling himself against the overwhelming grief.>\n\nBut now is not the time for tears. We must find other survivors, regroup, and offer them solace in this time of darkness.\n\nHowever, the right words do not come easily.",
