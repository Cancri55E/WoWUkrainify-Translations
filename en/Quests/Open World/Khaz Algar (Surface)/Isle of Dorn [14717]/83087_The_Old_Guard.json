All those earthen bodies...\n\nRepurposed... like reprogrammed? Tae protect what?\n \nLet's chase the other signal. Looks like it leads up ahead intae the hills.\n\nI'm goin' to stay here with Brinthe an' investigate this tower further. You take the device.",

I put 'em together for ye to read. It's more about Dornic and Galan.\n\nBut it looks like we know where Galan ended up at least without 'em--buried under tons o' rock. But what was she guardin'?\n\nWhat was so important that she was repurposed tae safeguard it for thousands of years?\n\nArgh! We have more questions than answers. I dunnae like it.",
