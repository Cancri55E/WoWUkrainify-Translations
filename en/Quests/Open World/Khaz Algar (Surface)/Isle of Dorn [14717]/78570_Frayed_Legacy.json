    "Description": "Keep true, $rt.\n\nWe of the Woldguard uphold an ancient promise to Freya to tend to these lands. Our edict is older than those wielded by the demagogues in Dornogal. Older than Dornogal itself.\n\nHowever, not all lands have been tended equally. The leader of our order was to care for the basin nearby but we've not heard from them in many cycles.\n\nI have sent a novice to investigate. Aid them and my order will be in your favor.",
