    "Description": "Before Dalaran crashed, I was a preeminent expert on gems. But I lost it all--gems, books, scrolls--like everyone else. \n\nImagine my surprise when I learned of a creature named Basalteous that possesses knowledge of gems stretching back before the Sundering. \n\nI want that knowledge. I will do anything for it.\n\nBut the rock-skinned yokels here won't tell me any more about Basalteous. Can you get the earthen to talk?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Gather information on Basalteous from earthen villagers.",
    "CompletionText": "Were you able to talk to them? Do you have any information?",
    "RewardText": "You got them to talk to you? Amazing! That is more information than I thought they had.",
