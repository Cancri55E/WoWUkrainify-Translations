    "Description": "Ramoliths! Magnificent, aren't they? One of the finest elemental beasts on the isle. \n\nThe bad news is they're not immune to injury. Poor Shalehoof here was attacked by awakened elementals in Farnee's pond.\n\nThe good news is that we have all we need to tend to him.\n\nWe just have to mix that clay you found with some fire honey and slap it up on ol' Shalehoof's hock! \n\nReady?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Help Harmot prepare Shalehoof's salve.",
    "CompletionText": "Much like us earthen, healing something made from rock and stone is no easy task.\n\nBut the unique properties of the clay you've brought, combined with the fusing properties of the honey makes for an excellent restorative!",
    "RewardText": "Well, aren't you just a natural with the elements. Ever thought about making a career out of it?\n\nSay, since you're not afraid of getting messy, why don't you help us with Farnee's problem?",
