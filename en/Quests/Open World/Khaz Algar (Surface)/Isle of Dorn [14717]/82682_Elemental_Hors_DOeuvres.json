    "Description": "The cloudrooks cannot possibly circle forever, and I cannot bear more of them being lost. But maybe they'd roost if we tempted them with their favorite food?\n\nThe eels that swim in these waters carry a small electrical charge not unlike the mosswool favored by their faster, stronger cousins the stormrooks. I once reasoned that cloudrooks might enjoy the eels for similar reasons. \n\nAnd I confess... I've been feeding them the eels ever since. \n\nGather some up and give it a go.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Gather 10 Electric Eels.",
    "CompletionText": "The eels may not pack quite the punch of Rambleshire mosswool, but the cloudrooks seem to prefer it that way.",
    "RewardText": "These should do.\n\nHope you didn't get any nasty shocks gathering them up.\n\nWe can restore some energy to the cloudrooks and show them that it's safe to land.",
