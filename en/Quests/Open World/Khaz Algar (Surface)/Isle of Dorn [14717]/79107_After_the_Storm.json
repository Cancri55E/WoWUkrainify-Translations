    "Description": "Turalyon and Geya'rah are training our new earthen allies as ground forces. But we will need more than that. We will need the Stormriders. \n\nMany were lost in the infiltration of the Stormperch and more to the nerubians. Their leader, Stormward Baelgrim, died valiantly.\n\nThe surviving Stormriders are being cared for at a triage station nearby. We need to do whatever is necessary to get them and their rooks back in the air. They will be the earthen's most potent weapon in the battles to come.",

    "RewardText": "I'm sorry about Shraubendre. She was just protecting me. And I lied to protect her.\n\nBut you truly don't intend to take her away? You just want to summon more stormrooks?",
