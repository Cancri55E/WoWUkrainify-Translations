    "Description": "I got cut off from the rest of the crew. We did not expect to be attacked by nerubians. Though I can't imagine the rest quitting.\n\nOur duty is too important to give up just yet. \n\nBarging right into the mine could cause the nerubians to frenzy and hurt the others. So, I found a third way to get in earlier. Though undetected will still be tough. \n\nFollow me.",
