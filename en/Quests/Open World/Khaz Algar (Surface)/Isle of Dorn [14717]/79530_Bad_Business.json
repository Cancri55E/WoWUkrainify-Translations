    "Description": "I have not been to the Deeps since their machines shut down. Obstorn will have to guide us to Ardgrin's depot.\n\nOnce there, I will attempt a conversation. If Ardgrin is not amenable, which I suspect will be the case, we will respond with equal force. Our goal is to bring him back into the fold, not to beat him into submission. Ruling by fear only breeds resentment.\n\nWe will meet you in the Deeps. Come swiftly--and, of course, speak of this to no one.",
