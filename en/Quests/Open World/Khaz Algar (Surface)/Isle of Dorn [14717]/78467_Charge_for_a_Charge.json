    "Description": "I am pleased Dagran has brought you here. I need help with a dangerous task.\n\nI used Dagran's opals to repair the titan console we recently recovered from this site.\n\nThe Oathsworn have long wanted to learn more about the titans and restore records unreachable in the Archive--or from before its construction.\n\nThis console may hold some answers if we can bring it back online.\n\nTake this device I have made. It will lead you to titan power cells we can use to power it on now that it is restored.",
