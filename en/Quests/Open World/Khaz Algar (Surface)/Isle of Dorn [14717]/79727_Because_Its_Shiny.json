    "Description": "While these two were ordering you around, I thought I would do something useful and make sure the gorlocs were not going to surprise us here on the beach.\n\nNone of them seemed interested in us, but then I saw one huge gorloc.\n\nIt killed off some smaller gorlocs then took off. It had something glowing in its claw though!\n\nIt had to be an artifact. And it looked like it was working! We've got to get it back.\n\nBy \"we\" I mean \"you.\" Larger-than-average gorlocs are above my Dragonscale pay grade.",
