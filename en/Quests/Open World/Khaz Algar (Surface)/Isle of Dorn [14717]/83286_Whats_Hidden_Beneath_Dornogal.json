    "Description": "Strange. The mechanism and console here is receiving power, but I cannot initialize the reboot sequence.\n\nDagran's query may have to wait.\n\nI have been able to ascertain the facility's designation: the \"Vault of Memory.\" This leads me to believe that my original theory was correct. It is connected to the Archive in Dornogal.\n\nPerhaps, since both of you are familiar with this type of titan installation, you may have a better chance bringing it fully online.",

    "CompletionText": "Take your time. It has been here for millennia. I am sure it is not going anywhere.",
    "RewardText": "I now have access to the mainframe here in the Vault of Memory. \n\nThere is a lot here but... it is fragmented. It will take time to recompile it.\n\nAnd some data, I'm afraid, may be damaged and need repair.",
