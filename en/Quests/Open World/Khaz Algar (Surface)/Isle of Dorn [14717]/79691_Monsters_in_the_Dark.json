    "Description": "The local quarry was an active source of clay and ore for us until the fungarians took over some time ago.\n\nWe were worried about the fungarians encroaching upon the village, but there's something more.\n\nMultiple sightings of a creature much larger than our native wildlife have been reported at night.\n\nCombined with villager Modhina's disappearance, I fear this is no coincidence. She visited the quarry recently and hasn't returned.\n\nWe would be in your debt if you searched the tunnels.",

    "PortraitGiverText": "A stalker from deep within the earth, able to consume the hardiest of creatures.",
    "CompletionText": "You do us a great service by making our lands safe.",
    "RewardText": "A stonestalker, here? Their habitat resides far beneath the isle's surface. All the recent change must be disturbing them.\n\nRegardless, thank you for slaying it. They are highly territorial and kill for sport.\n\nAs for the tunnels, the area sounds beyond recovery. We'll have to let nature reclaim it.",
