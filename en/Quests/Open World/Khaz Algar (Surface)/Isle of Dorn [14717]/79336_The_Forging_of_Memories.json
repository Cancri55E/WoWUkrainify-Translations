But now, even if it was still working, I would see my cycle broken and be remembered as I am.\n\n<Korgran lets out a deep sigh.>\n\nThese hands look strong, but they become heavier with each passing moment. The stiffness in my wrists and elbows will not let me carry the items to the forge.\n\nPlease, add the right material to the forge as I call them out.",
