    "Description": "I know the Unbound can repair and unblock the Coreway expediently--but I also know the nerubians. If they see an opportunity for an ambush, they will take it.\n\nWith our backs turned and our focus on the Coreway, we are prime targets.\n\nI need to rally my Stormriders and form a perimeter around Dornogal in case of an attack from within or from without.\n\nMeet me outside of the Stormperch. I will call upon my troops there.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Meet Baelgrim outside the Stormperch, then speak with him to follow him into The Rookery.\n\nThis challenge may be completed solo or with up to 3 party members.",
    "CompletionText": "Baelgrim is right. We need to defend the Unbound while they work on the Coreway.",
    "RewardText": "The entire Rookery?\n\nI see.\n\nAt least the source is destroyed. I lament the loss of so many Stormriders but...\n\nIf the corruption had spread to Dornogal...",
