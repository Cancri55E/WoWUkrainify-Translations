    "Description": "My, $p, it seems you have drawn the attention of a particular audience member.\n\nThis fan letter was mistakenly included in my fan mail. I'm not surprised. Sorting my copious fan mail must be a difficult chore...\n\nHere, take it. It belongs to you, of course.\n\nI'm sure this is very new for you. I have a few pieces of wisdom for greeting eager fans, if you would like to hear it...",

    "RewardText": "We must be careful with fans. We must be gentle with their feelings but also discourage unwanted behaviors.\n\nKind and gracious acknowledgement of their gratitude is key. A simple thank you note in return is optimal. And if you see them here, it is acceptable to nod and wave. We want our audience to be happy, of course.\n\nAnd, in the event they bring flowers... I can graciously take that burden from you.",
