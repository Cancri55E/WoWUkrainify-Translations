    "Description": "The Order is moving the wood through the nerubians. Leif said he saw the shipwright leave the cave and head down to the beach. \n\nThe nerubian tunnel must be down there. You're going to have to seal that Flameforsaken passage.\n\nWhile slinking around, I noticed the Order brought explosive barrels with them. Find a few and use them to blow the tunnel.\n\nGet going $n. I'll be right behind you.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect Silkwood Explosive Barrels, then destroy the nerubian tunnel at Silkwood Grotto.",
    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Ready for turn-in",
    "RewardText": "Good stuff $n. That should put a dent in their plans!\n\nWith that tunnel gone, ain't no way for them to send that wood to Hallowfall now. That makes the mill all but worthless.\n\nPhew! Order stopped, earthen saved, nerubians killed. Job well done if you ask me!\n\nI don't know 'bout you, but I could use a vacation.",
