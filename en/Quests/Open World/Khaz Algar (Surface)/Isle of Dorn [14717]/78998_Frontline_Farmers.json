    "Description": "Most of the farmers are already out in the field, defending their positions. I have trained them as best I could given the circumstances, but they are still wielding farming tools. \n\nI need you to distribute the weapons you gathered to those on the frontlines. While it may not markedly improve their combat ability, at least it will boost their confidence that they are not alone in this fight.",

    "RewardText": "Excellent. As long as they fight together and for each other, I believe we will be victorious.",
