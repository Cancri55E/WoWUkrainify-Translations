    "Description": "I'm certain there are still Order folks sneaking around here. Now they might be carrying messages on them, just like the clues you found in Freywold. \n\nYou and I are gonna find out.\n\nHere, take these thuribles. They might look like tiny incense burners, but I've enchanted them with Sacred Flame. \n\nJust throw one down and you'll get a big bang with a bright flash! Should be enough to stun anyone sneaking around. \n\nJust don't throw one at me! Got it?",
