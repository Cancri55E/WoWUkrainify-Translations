    "Description": "The Unbound have a symbolic ceremony of cleansing. We perform it before a shutdown. \n\nIt is a symbolic process of purification. For it, we need to gather ashenfold, a flower that grows around the isle. We waft the smoke of the burned flowers through the fissures and cracks in our bodies to symbolically remove impurities.\n\nWe are then ready to embrace our final moments.\n\n<Urtago looks at Korgran with a hand on her chest.
