    "Description": "The last thing I expected today was to see Baelgrim--much less receive his help. But I guess since the Coreway was damaged, he has no choice.

It becomes a masticated pulp disturbingly quickly.>\n\nHere. Mix this with mud and apply it to the injured.",

    "CompletionText": "We've fought off animals and elementals before, but nerubians? My people are artisans and miners--not warriors.",
    "RewardText": "<Adelgon appraises Moira, Baelgrim, and finally you.>\n\nI... thank you. It's been a long time since I've received help from outlanders--or the Oathsworn.",
