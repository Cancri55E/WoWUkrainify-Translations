    "Description": "Councilward Merrix has authorized trade goods from the Deeps to be transported through this depot. However, we have received a tip that more than crafting materials are being sent and received here.\n\nDornogal observes strict rules about what we trade and with whom. All commerce must serve the Edicts, not the interests of individuals. We do not abide unsanctioned trading.\n\nWe have started going through the crates here to find smuggled goods, but we haven't found anything--yet. Help us take a look.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 3 Seized Shipments.",
    "CompletionText": "The tip we received was from a highly reliable source. There must be something here.",
    "RewardText": "That is odd... These are very normal trading goods. There is nothing illicit here.\n\nThis is all you found?",
