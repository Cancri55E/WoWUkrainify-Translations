    "Description": "The rooks and their chosen riders will need time to bond. \n\nPerhaps you should use this time to check in on our other trainees. \n\nThe Stormriders are the traditional army of the earthen, but many Unbound and Oathsworn have expressed willingness to fight at our side due to help in restoring their machines.\n\nAdelgonn, Geya'rah, and Turalyon are busy training them. Go and see if they need any assistance.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Meet with Adelgonn, Geya'rah, and Turalyon.",
    "RewardText": "Someone save me from all this bickering. Alliance this, Horde that... \n\nI've never encountered anything like it in my thousands of years even amongst the Oathsworn and Unbound. If they committed half the energy they expend on posturing towards training, our task would be complete by now.\n\nSee what help you can offer my people. They need real mentorship if we are to be ready for the next nerubian offensive.",
