    "Description": "There's word of troubles in the village of Rambleshire, at the base of Thunderhead Peak. \n\nCan't abide the place myself. Always wet and rumbling.\n\nBut Rooktender Lufsela thought it worth a look, however, seeing as how the birds fancy the moss that the village produces. She's still green though, and might just need a hand.",
