    "Description": "There's word of troubles in the village of Rambleshire, at the base of Thunderhead Peak. \n\nCan't abide the place myself. Always wet and rumbling.\n\nBut Rooktender Lufsela thought it worth a look, however, seeing as how the birds fancy the moss that the village produces. She's still green though, and might just need a hand.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Meet Lufsela in Rambleshire.",
    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Meet Lufsela at the entrance to Rambleshire",
    "RewardText": "Otwin sent you? Probably misses my help brushing out the rooks. But there's something amiss here in Rambleshire.\n\nThere should be a storm overhead. Been visible from Dornogal for as long as I can remember. Without that storm, I fear the local mosswool operation is in trouble.",
