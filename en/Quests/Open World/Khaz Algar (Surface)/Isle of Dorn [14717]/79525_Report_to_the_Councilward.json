    "Description": "Those receipts you found... Steelvein is a known smuggler that we've been chasing for a long time. The Councilward will be pleased to finally have solid evidence on his activities, and maybe even on his whereabouts.\n\nBring these receipts to Merrix immediately. He will want to study them in detail. He said he was heading back to his office, so you should be able to find him at the Councilward's Rise.\n\nI'll package up the rest of the evidence to be brought to him later. Good work today.",
