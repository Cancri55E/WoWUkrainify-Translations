We'll be puttin' these rookies through their paces. Startin' with the basics of aerial maneuverin' at speed, we'll do our best to simulate the kind of precision flyin' we might expect below ground. \n\nAfter that, we'll open see what these rooks can really do--Thrall and Lufsela have somethin' special cooking.",
