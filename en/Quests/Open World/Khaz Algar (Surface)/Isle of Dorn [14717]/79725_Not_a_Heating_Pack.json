    "Description": "Tharessa has done some reconnaissance for us and found the gorlocs are digging up artifacts and... cuddling with them. \n\nI think it means that the artifacts emit heat? Maybe that means some artifacts are still functioning?\n\nImagine--the titans created technology to shape worlds, and now a fish uses it to warm their fins. Hah!\n\nThe gorlocs won't give them up, and I don't want to be a Rannan-kabob either. I hate to ask because they just want to be warm, but could you do something about them?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Rannan wants you to kill 12 gorlocs.",
    "CompletionText": "Did you get them? I thought I saw one sneak by a moment ago...",
    "RewardText": "Wonderful! Now we can focus our attention on what really matters--the artifacts. I wonder what we will discover?",
