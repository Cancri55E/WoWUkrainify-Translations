    "Description": "Please excuse my absence. It was never my intention to turn my back on the Stormriders, then or now. But I needed to come here and pay my respects to Baelgrim.\n\nUnfortunately, these blasted nerubians are still lingering. I think they're searching for something, but I don't know what. Whatever their reasons, I cannot abide them lurking where Baelgrim fell.",
