    "Description": "Remember when we used that clay and the fire honey to patch up Shalehoof? Let's do that again but bigger!\n\nProblem is we've run out of clay. But fortunately, with all the recent seismic activity, a whole avalanche of elementals has been roused out of torpor and are clashing on the eastern beach!\n\nBring me wet, elementally charged silt to use as our restorative substrate!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Gather 20 handfuls of Elementally Charged Silt.",
    "CompletionText": "By combining living sand and water, we can create an elemental silt that mimics the underclay's healing properties. Or at least something that comes close to it!\n\nIsn't elemental fusion fascinating?",
    "RewardText": "Can you feel the energy in the silt between your fingers, $n? The charge that hums through it?\n\nIsn't it exhilarating? Doesn't it make you feel one with the earth and the mountains?\n\n<Harmot squeezes the silt in his thick stony fingers.>",
