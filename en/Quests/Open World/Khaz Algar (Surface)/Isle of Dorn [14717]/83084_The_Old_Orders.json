    "Description": "Long ago, there were once plans to build a tunnel through the mountain into Dornogal. \n\nBefore excavation could begin, the surrounding area was suddenly abandoned. \n\nThere is no record of what happened. Only a... deterrence--the field--that keeps earthen away from this region.\n\nEvery part of my cognitive matrix is pressing for me to leave. But we must persist. \n\nThe device's signal indicates something lies within the nearby tower.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Investigate the abandoned tower behind Dornogal.",
    "CompletionText": "I'm not sure what's afflicting Brinthe, but it's clear she's in pain. I offered to escort her back to the city but she refused.\n\nI will stay with her an' make sure she does nae take a turn for the worse and try an' figure this device out more too.",
    "RewardText": "Forget what ye found in the tower--did ye see that?! Those looked like titan watchers!\n\nBut... what does it all mean? And who were they?",
