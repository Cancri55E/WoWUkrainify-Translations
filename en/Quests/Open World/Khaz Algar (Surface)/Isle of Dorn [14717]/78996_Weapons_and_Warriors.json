Seek them out and request their aid. If they are hesitant, offer them the promise of pearls as payment.\n\nWe will also need to arm these farmers so they can defend themselves. Search for spare weapons and equipment that they might be able to use.\n\nI will go with the farmers and train them as best I can.",
