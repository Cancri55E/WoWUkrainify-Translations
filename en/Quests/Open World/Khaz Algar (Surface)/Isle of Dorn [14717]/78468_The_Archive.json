    "Description": "The memory gem you recovered is what its name suggests. It contains an earthen's memories, directives, and a hard coding of our Edicts.\n\nThis building, the Archive, is the nexus of our civilization. Here, memories are cycled, catalogued, and stored at the end of an earthen's scheduled rotation.\n\nWith the codex I have invented, we can access one or two memories from a memory gem. Take it, and read the memory gem you found.",
