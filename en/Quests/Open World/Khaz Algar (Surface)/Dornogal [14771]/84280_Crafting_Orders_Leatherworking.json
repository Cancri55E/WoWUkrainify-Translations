    "Description": "So you are a leatherworker? You should have mentioned that earlier!\n\nLet me send you to Marbb, a leatherworker of great renown, who has her shop on the eastern side of the Forgegrounds. I will mark it on your map. \n\nMarbb has her very own leatherworker's bench where you can review, craft, and deliver work orders from public lists and personal contacts like friends and guilds. If you are lucky, you might come across an order from a renowned person that offers some extra rewards--or so I hear.",
