    "Description": "So you are a blacksmith? You should have mentioned that earlier!\n\nLet me send you to Darean, a blacksmith of great renown, who has her shop within the Forgegrounds. I will mark it on your map. \n\nDarean has her very own Blacksmith's table where you can review, craft, and deliver work orders from public lists and personal contacts like friends and guildmates. If you are lucky, you might come across an order from a renowned person that offers some extra rewards--or so I hear.",
