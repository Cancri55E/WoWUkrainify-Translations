They can be vicious critters but-- oh, I can't help but feel a certain kinship with them!\n\nTheir little candles... keeping their little flames lit...\n\n<Faerin clasps her hand to her chest with a grin.> \n\nSo brave! They would be ideal Lamplighters, if only they would share! And... were less likely to claw your eyes out. \n\nReports of their activities in Darkflame Cleft have the earthen worried. Though I wish the kobolds were kinder, we can't allow them to hurt our allies. Please investigate!",
