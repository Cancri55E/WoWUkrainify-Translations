    "Description": "Well, that was quite the nap. I wasn't expecting Azeroth to be so... loud. To normal folk, she's gently calling out. But with our connection, it felt like she was screaming. Directly into my crystal noggin.\n\nI saw it though. Khaz Algar, an island of earthen, bathed in fire and smoke. That's where Azeroth is trying to lead us.\n\nThat's what we need to protect.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Discuss the next steps, then follow up with Khadgar.",
    "RewardText": "The council has decided. We travel to Khaz Algar.\n\nDalaran will teleport as soon as we're able. Will you lend us your aid in our preparations?",
