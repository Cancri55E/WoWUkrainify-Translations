    "Description": "If we're going tae be exploring new lands in Khaz Algar, then we'll be needing help from the Explorers' League. But they won't be alone in this adventure. The League is teaming up with the Reliquary again, just like on the Dragon Isles. \n\nThey're calling themselves the Algari Expedition this time around.\n\nI'm just a wee bit worried if they're still getting along. Exploring can tear folks apart just as easily as it binds them together. Can you check in on the lot?",

    "CompletionText": "A league and an expedition walk into a tavern... Nope, nothing's coming to me.",
    "RewardText": "They're getting along? Well I'll be a goat's uncle. Ach, no offense to Dagran.\n\nWell, that certainly makes my job easier. Thanks for checking in on them, all the same!",
