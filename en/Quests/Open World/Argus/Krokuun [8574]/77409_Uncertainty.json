    "Description": "Scattered visions came to me as I meditated. Yellow and red. Shattering glass. A rush of warmth. I see my own hand, but I am afraid to grasp it. The scent of fel--of Argus.\n\nWhen I awoke, a message had been delivered. Hatuun wishes to meet.\n\nAfter the defeat of the Legion, I offered to help Hatuun and his people rejoin us. However, they chose to remain on Argus. \n\nHatuun has seldom reached out to us since then. Perhaps he has reconsidered.\n\nI will make the journey to Krokuun. Please, join me.",
