    "Description": "Nalridun has recruited a small army of cultists. They believe he speaks for Sargeras through the relic, clinging to every word he says. The same way we clung to our leaders when Sargeras came to Argus. It was a comfort. A hope.\n\nAnd, in the end, empty deception.\n\nBut his followers do not believe they are deceived. They have constructed their own conduits in the area to try to tap into the relic's power. To hear the voice themselves.\n\nThey will try to stop us. We must cut a path through them.",
