    "Description": "I'm impressed. Elder Honeypelt speaks highly of you--and that's rare!\n\nYour friends Ebyssian and Emberthal admittedly made similar impressions with us after we caught their scent. They told me of your hunt for the fiery monster that's invaded Zaralek from the uplands. A worthy reason to become allies.\n\nBut we'll need a bit more time to discuss it. Why not take a short break to meet with my people. Trade, leisure, travel--there's no shortage of ways to spend your time here in Loamm!",
