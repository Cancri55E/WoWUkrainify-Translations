    "Description": "Greetings! \n\nApologies if I seem... distracted. I have been beside myself worrying about my injured friends. \n\nBut maybe you, gentle$c, can assist us?\n\nNarvra needs aid in healing us. Shards from crystal elementals have healing properties. I feel terrible asking to harm a fellow elemental, but if you could... obtain some from them, that would greatly aid my friends.\n\nDon't worry--the elementals will regenerate in time. My friends' needs come first, however impolite our gathering methods may be.",
