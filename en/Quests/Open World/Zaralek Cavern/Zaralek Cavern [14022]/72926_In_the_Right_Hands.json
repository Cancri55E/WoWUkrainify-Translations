    "Description": "There are several weapons of historical value that I believed were lost to time. I would bet my talons that they are here at this garrison.\n\nThe dragonspawn and drakonid loyally cling to the memory of my long-dead father. Misguided fools. \n\nThey have access to my father's forges and weapons, and it is likely the very weapons I thought lost are stored nearby. \n\nIf they find out what they have, they will use the weapons against us. They cannot remain in their claws.",
