    "Description": "Those djaradin might smell like brutes, but their engineering corps must be top notch to keep churning out ballistae strong enough to threaten a dragon!\n\nNortheast of Loamm there's an ongoing scrap between them and some black dragons. There ought to be lots of spare parts scattered around. Or slightly used, moderately on fire ones, anyway!\n\nHaul them all back to Loamm! A little scorching won't stop our top minds from reverse niffeneering them.",
