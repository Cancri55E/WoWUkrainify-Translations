    "Description": "That djaradin called her people the \"Zaqali\"--but my troops did not report any information regarding a second active djaradin tribe in the Dragon Isles. I detest an unknown in war.\n\nWe will need to learn what we can about them--and quickly--in order to assess their strengths and weaknesses. I have found the best way to know a culture is to examine how they make war.\n\nSlay any you find in the nearby area and take their armaments. I will expect your report.",
