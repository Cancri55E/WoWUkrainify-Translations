    "Description": "Our situation is less than ideal, we will have to improvise. I can conduct flame to earth to create magma. Shadowflame could behave similarly.\n\nThe Primalists are summoning earth elementals nearby. If we extract their cores, I can use them to contain the shadowflame infecting Sabellian's burn.\n\nThe Zaqali's totems should already be attuned to the elements here. It will make the siphoning process much more efficient.\n\nSabellian will need to come with us. I must keep an eye on him--for his sake.",
