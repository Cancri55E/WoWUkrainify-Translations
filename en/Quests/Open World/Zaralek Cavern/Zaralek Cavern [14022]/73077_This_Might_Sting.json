Probably.\n\n He will just be in pain.\n\n<Patroclosa looks at you, then sighs.>\n\nI suppose if you wanted to spare him this fate, you could collect bile from the Quartzite Sporebats that roam this valley. It contains a natural antivenom that would ease his suffering. But I will not waste my healing magic on a murderer.\n\nAnd you may as well bring back loamshrooms, to help him keep the bile down. Though it's a kindness he doesn't deserve.",
