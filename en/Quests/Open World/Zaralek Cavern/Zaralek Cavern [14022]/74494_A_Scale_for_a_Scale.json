But there is one more mission I must complete before we depart, lest we lose our only chance to complete it at all.\n\nHowever different the Zaqali tribe may be from the Qalashi, they are still dragonslayers. Their implements of war are no less deadly to our kind.\n\nI need a spear on par with the one we saw at the elder's side. Find the largest one you can and deliver it to me.",
