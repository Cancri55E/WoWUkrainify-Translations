    "Description": "If you are finished indulging Ebyssian's associate, I would have us return to more pressing matters. \n\nLocating Fyrakk is still our primary mission. We cannot continue to delay it.\n\nI have discovered a massive caldera at the western edge of Zaralek. If Fyrakk is still here, then logic dictates that this volcanic area would be his hideout.\n\nMeet us there and we will proceed.",
