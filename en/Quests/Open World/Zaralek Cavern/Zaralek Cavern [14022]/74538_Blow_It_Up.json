    "Description": "Make no mistake, the djaradin are experienced dragon killers. But right now their ruthless tactics are overshadowed by the devastating power of their battlefield ballistae, capable of taking out any threat from a long distance. \n\nI have lost many good soldiers to these potent weapons.\n\nIt is essential that we destroy the ballistae if we hope to level the playing field and take to the skies. It is possible that we may even be able to gain the upper hand in this war.",
