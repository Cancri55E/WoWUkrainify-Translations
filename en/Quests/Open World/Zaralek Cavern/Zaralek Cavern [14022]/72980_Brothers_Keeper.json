    "Description": "By my scales, I needed that win! That blasted Incarnate swatting us like flies did a number on my ego, and I assume Sabellian feels no different. \n\nAs infuriating as I find his lack of humor, groaning voice, and ugly shoes... I would ask that you check in on him. He is still family, after all, and I do not wish him to become dinner to these deepflayers.\n\nMeet Honeypelt and I outside these dreadful nests when you finish up with Sabellian.",
