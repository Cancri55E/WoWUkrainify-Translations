    "Description": "No longer can we allow Fyrakk to lie here peacefully, twisting himself with shadowflame and becoming a threat on par with Deathwing. We must act! Is it dangerous? Yes. But not to do anything would be catastrophic.\n\nI have ripped gronn apart with my bare claws before. Those battles were gambles, this one is not. Slaying a proto-dragon with a weapon meant for dragonslaying is obvious. It is logical. It is guaranteed.\n\nI will not tremble before an opportunity to end this now.",
