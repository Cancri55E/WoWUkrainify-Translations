    "Description": "Another member of the Sundered Flame has been apprehended on Scalecommander Emberthal's behalf. A messenger, Amythora thinks.\n\nWe must decide what to do with him. In the meantime, it would be helpful if you could see if he has any important information.\n\nHe is well-guarded, so don't worry about him putting up a fight. Some passing Dracthyr offered their aid-- said they were companions of the Scalecommander! And they knew just how to handle Sundered Flame prisoners.",
