    "Description": "I had not expected to find djaradin here, though it does not surprise me. Legends tell of their elders slumbering beneath the earth. It makes sense that some would delve underground in search of them.\n\nTheir forces are heavily guarding this outer area. I recognize the magic their scouts are using--it is farsight, powered by those totems near them.\n\nI spotted a larger totem at the top of the nearby tower. If you can figure out how to power it, we can use it to search the caldera from afar.",
