    "Description": "It's not common these days, but we do have a few of our histories in writing--well, carvings really. We can trace the etchings with our fingers! \n\nWe used to use clay tablets for this, but they were brittle, and prone to breaking. Not good if you want to preserve history!\n\nI hear the djaradin carve their important texts into volcanic glass. If they can manage that without shattering the tablets, we could probably learn a thing or two from their techniques!\n\nTake some samples back to Loamm for study.",
