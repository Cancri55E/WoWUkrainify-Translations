    "Description": "For years I worked with Denalan in Teldrassil. His research will be the foundation of how we will restore these seeds.\n\nThe first step: we must coax them back to life, allowing them to grow into vibrant blossoming plants. I have located suitable patches of soil where the plants can take root and grow, revealing their true potential. \n\nWe will plant one small, one plump, and one gigantic seed to observe how the quality of the seed can sprout different growth.",
