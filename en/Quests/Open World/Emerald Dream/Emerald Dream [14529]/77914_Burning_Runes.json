    "Description": "I am told that the Druids of the Flame help to stabilize their portals into the dream through the use of a unique sort of inscription! While their ends are abhorrent, I cannot help but be curious as to their means.\n\nIf we can better understand their methods, then perhaps we can better equip our allies to stem the tide of their arrival. If you get your hands on any burning runes, could you bring them to my colleague for further study?",
