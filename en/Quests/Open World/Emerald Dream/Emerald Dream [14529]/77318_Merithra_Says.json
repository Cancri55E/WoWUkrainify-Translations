    "Description": "Some druids are volunteering to help tend to the tree and set up camp.  \n\nBut they're so sad! \n\n<Lady Moonberry grows a mischievous grin.> \n\nWe have to give them a reason to smile. You can give them some orders that remind them to have fun. \n\nBut there's no way they'll take orders from you. \n\nThat's why I got this costume for you. With this and a little spell they'll for sure listen to you!",
