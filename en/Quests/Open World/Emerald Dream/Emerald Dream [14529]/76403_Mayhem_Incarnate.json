He is holding his forces away from the tree, but we do not know why.\n\nI can do some scouting, but direct conflict with Fyrakk would not help our cause right now.\n\nFollow me further into the Dream. There is a Primalist encampment to the north. Let us start there, so we can put an end to this madness.",
