    "Description": "I... almost cannot believe this worked. I am ever grateful for everyone's trust and faith. We could not have won this battle without the help of our allies and the flight.\n\nBut the fight is far from over. Based on the intel we have gathered, Fyrakk and his minions are preparing an even greater assault. Their bases stand strong and terrifyingly close to the Dream's Hope, bastion of Amirdrassil.\n\nThe Eye might have only been a distraction. We will regroup at Amirdrassil with the rest of our allies.",
