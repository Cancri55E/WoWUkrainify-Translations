    "Description": "During this very unique time of bloom, a new flower has been discovered in the Dream. These stunning flowers produce a marvelous pollen. Its aroma is a delight, just like fresh baked cookies.\n\nTo the dismay of chefs, even eating a tiny bit will result in rapid, severe poisoning of the liver.\n\nHowever, it is an incredible all-purpose addition to enchanting. Early tests demonstrate potency as high as quadruple that of Chromatic Dust. Traders from Valdrakken are very interested in its acquisition.",
