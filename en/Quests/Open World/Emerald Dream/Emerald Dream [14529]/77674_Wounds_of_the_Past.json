    "Description": "It's all making sense now. I believe the missing dream spirit bonded with her--like Cyanthesa said.\n\nIt's making Shandris relive traumatic moments from her life. \n\nIt's not malicious, but the spirit and Shandris are feeding off each others' fears. We have to bring her back to the camp. Shae'lune might be able to help her.\n\nTalk to her. I look like the enemy right now. But maybe she'll talk to you.",
