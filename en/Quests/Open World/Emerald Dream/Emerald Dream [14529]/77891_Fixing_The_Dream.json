    "Description": "Engineering is an exact science! When something explodes, engineers plan it that way. \n\nDreams are not exact, especially emerald ones! Someday, someone will want engineers to fix the Dream, and we won't know how to do it. We need a lot more information to understand what we're dealing with!\n\nGo to the Dream and place research beacons at my designated points. They will gather the information needed for any future repairs. Use this handy teleport device if you want to find the locations quickly.",
