    "Description": "The Druids of the Flame are nothing more than allies of convenience to Fyrakk and his ilk. Nevertheless, they present a dire threat to the well-being of Amirdrassil, to say nothing of the rest of the Dream.\n\nThe victory we earned here today was hard-fought, but it only served to stem the tide. No doubt the Prophet and the Priestess have already reunited with their erstwhile allies.\n\nWe should return to Merithra. She needs to know of this.",
