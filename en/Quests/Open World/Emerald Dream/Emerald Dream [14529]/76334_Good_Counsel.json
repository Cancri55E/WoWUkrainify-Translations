    "Description": "Galok is a coward. He refuses to engage us directly until he is sure of success.\n\nWe do not have the resources to attack his base. But if we cannot go to him, maybe we can entangle him in our own territory.\n\nI am confident we can prepare a trap here for Galok and his forces. My plan is not without risks, and controlling the playing field will be our key advantage.\n\nThe question remains... how do we lure them here?",
