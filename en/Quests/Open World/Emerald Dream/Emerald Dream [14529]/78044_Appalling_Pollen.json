    "Description": "This cinder pollen doesn't evoke interesting change. It consumes all until nothing, but ash remains. It brings... uniformity.  \n\nAnd I find that to be tragically stale. \n\nI'm all for change, no matter the origin. But if THIS change stymies all future possibilities for further change, then it must be stopped. \n  \nIf creatures of the dream have been infected by this pollen, then they must be extinguished. This is not a flame that can be allowed to grow.",
