We know so little about it!\n\nMy father followed a trail of clues to the cave down the hill, seeking a very old poem known as the Song of the Vale, but he is in no condition to retrieve it. It is guarded by some sort of ancestor spirit.\n\nIf you are heading that way anyway, would you mind bringing it back to him?",
