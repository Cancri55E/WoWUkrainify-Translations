It looks quite hungry since you last left it.\n\nFrom the way it whimpers and slaps its tail, you can tell it is not looking for just any treat, but a special favorite snack.\n\nYour serpent loves to munch on tiny spider eyes, but this delicacy comes only from the Widowspawn spiders in the cave along the coast to the north.\n\nWell, what's a rider to do? Your serpent is waiting.",
