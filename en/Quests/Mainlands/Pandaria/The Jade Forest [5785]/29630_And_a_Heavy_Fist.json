    "Description": "The greenwood sprites in the Waxwood Forest to the west pose no direct threat to us, this is true. However, their numbers have increased as of late, as have their wily antics.\n\nPart of our duty as wardens of this forest is to maintain the balance. Your duty is to do so by returning these sprites to the earth.",

    "CompletionText": "Very recently, I was walking in the Waxwood, when one of these sprites got on all fours behind my knees, evading my notice. Soon afterward, a second sprite approached me from the front, shoving me forcefully in the chest. Unaware of the first sprite, I stepped backwards, only to stumble on his prostrate form and fall, embarrassingly, onto my backside.\n\nSo yes, I have a vested interest in this assignment.",
    "RewardText": "Thank you, $n. The sprites' numbers will return in several days' time, but for now, the balance is maintained.",
