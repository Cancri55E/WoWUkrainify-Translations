We'll need to deal with them before any more Alliance show up.\n\nThis one's taken quite a beating, but I've still made some determinations about its anatomy.\n\nWith the proper reagents, I'll be able to fashion a poison that should be quite effective against this species. In fact, I'll just need to modify a bit of the poison I have with me.\n\nGo and find me some viscous chlorophyll down by the water. Any semi-sentient flora should do.",
