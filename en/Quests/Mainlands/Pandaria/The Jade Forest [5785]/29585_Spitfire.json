    "Description": "We've tended these orchards and made cider from their nectar for generations. In that time, we've learned a special trick for putting out fires in a pinch.\n\n<Hanae pushes a jug of cider into your hand.>\n\nThe cider itself - when mixed with crushed gingerleaf and saliva - quickly becomes sticky and viscous. Perfect for smothering flames.\n\nPlease, while you're out there, try to get the flames under control. I've already mixed in the gingerleaf, just swig and spit.",
