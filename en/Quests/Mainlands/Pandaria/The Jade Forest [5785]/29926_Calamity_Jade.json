    "Description": "You ever seen a shale spider, $c? Usually harmless, just creepin' around eatin' rocks, but they got a taste for jade like cubs on candy. The boys call 'em \"nibblers.\"\n\nA few days back, we tunneled into a huge nest of these critters. They spilled out into the mines and went crazy, chewed up damn near everything in sight - including some of the boys.\n\nYou get in there and clear 'em out, and we got plenty of jade to spare. The quarry is directly west of here.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Slay 12 Greenstone Nibblers and 6 Greenstone Gorgers at the Greenstone Quarry.",
    "CompletionText": "Never thought nibblers would be a big enough threat to choke up the whole mine.",
    "RewardText": "Well I'll be... you actually did it!\n\nYou lookin' for a more permanent job, $gbuddy:sister;? I could use a bruiser like you around full-time!",
