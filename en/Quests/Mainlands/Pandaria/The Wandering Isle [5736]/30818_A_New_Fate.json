    "Description": "$n, I'm thankful the plan worked, but just barely. We would be sinking to the bottom of the ocean with all of Shen-zin Su if you hadn't been here. I don't think I can ever forgive Ji for this kind of recklessness.\n\nThere will be plenty of time for reflection, but for now, we need to return to the Temple of Five Dawns. We need to let them know that Shen-zin Su has been saved, and we need to sort out the fates of these new allies.",
