I'm deeply appreciative.\n\nWe're still dealing with more than we can handle here: quenching the fires on the wreckage, getting my people out, fighting off these evil sea creatures, and trying to prevent the prisoners from escaping. We're simply in over our heads.\n\nI still have men on the ship that we need to get clear before the wreckage collapses on them. I know this is asking a lot, but can you help?",
