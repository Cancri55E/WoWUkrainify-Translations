They keep to themselves normally, but they know something bad is coming, so they're here to steal our supplies.\n\nIn situations like this, the clear answer is the only answer. These monkeys will leave when we force them to leave! To not defend our town and those we love would be the only true crime. Thus is the way of the Huojin.",
