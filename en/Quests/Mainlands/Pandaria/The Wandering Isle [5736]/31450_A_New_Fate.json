The world needs healing, and I think that you should be the ones to heal it.\n\nI would like you, Ji, and Aysa to leave and bring your strength and wisdom to the world. These Alliance and Horde have different ideals, but at the core of both lies noble intent.\n\nI will leave the choice of who you wish to accompany to you.",
