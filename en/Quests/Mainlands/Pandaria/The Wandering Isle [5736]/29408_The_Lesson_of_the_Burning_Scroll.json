    "Title": "The Lesson of the Burning Scroll",
    "Description": "Every wisdom has a time and place, and times are changing for those of us living here on Shen-zin Su. For this lesson, I would ask two things of you.\n\nFor the first, I hold a flame in my hand. Gather your wits, and when you think you are ready, attempt to snatch the flame.\n\nShould you succeed, I want you to then climb to the top of this temple and burn the Edict of Temperance that you find there.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Snatch the flame from Master Shang Xi's palm, then burn the Edict of Temperance.",
    "CompletionText": "There will come time when you must trust your instincts and simply act.",
    "RewardText": "The fact that you were able to snatch the flame so easily is no small feat.\n\nThe Edict of Temperance is a scroll of wisdom passed down from my elders' elders. Wisdom from a more peaceful time.\n\nEvery lesson has its time and place, and with darkness on the horizon, the time for this particular wisdom has passed.\n\nThe burning of the scroll is an acceptance of tidings to come and a promise to action. Your hand carried the flame, and I suspect that it will continue to do so in the future.",
