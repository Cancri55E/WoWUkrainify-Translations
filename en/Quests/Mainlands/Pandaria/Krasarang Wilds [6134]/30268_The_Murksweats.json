    "Description": "Take a good look. The river nearby is swarming with these snakes. Their venom causes a condition the locals call \"the murksweats.\"\n\nSeveral refugees were bitten as they fled the temple and have already begun to show symptoms: nausea, vomiting, and intense sweating as the body rejects all fluids, causing dehydration and potentially death.\n\nWe are administering anti-venom as quickly as possible, but we'll need more venom glands. Don't bother removing the glands yourself - just bring back the whole head.",
