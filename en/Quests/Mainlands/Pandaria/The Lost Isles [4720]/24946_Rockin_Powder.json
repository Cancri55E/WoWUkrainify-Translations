I think I've discovered the source of their rockin' powers: Rockin' Powder!\n\nIt turns out that this stuff, which turns them into world-class rockers, is also highly explosive. We must have it!\n\nSo, while you're in there at Oostan to the east, make sure that you pickup a whole bunch of the stuff. Trust me, you're going to need it for what's coming up!",
