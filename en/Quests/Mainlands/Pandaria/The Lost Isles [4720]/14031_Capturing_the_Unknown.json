    "Title": "Capturing the Unknown",
    "Description": "Heya, $n, there are strange cave paintings and other artifacts all over the cavern.\n\nDo you think you could use your belt-mounted KTC Snapflash camera to capture images at the designated spots? Also, snap a pic of the altar in the back of the cavern.\n\nI'm sure that Sassy will want the intel.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Using your KTC Snapflash, capture images at the bouncing cameras of the three cave paintings and the pygmy altar.",
    "RewardText": "What are these?\n\n<Sassy examines the pictures while listening to your tale from the Kaja'mite cavern.>\n\nClearly that pygmy witchdoctor is from some new race never seen before. Maybe we should call them $n-ians?\n\nThey must be the ones that painted all of that stuff in the cavern. I'm not sure that I like what you're describing.\n\nIt sounds to me like they're paintings of them and us on an island with an exploding volcano!",
