    "Description": "Looking through the dead orc's belongings, you find a field journal. Though it is heavily water damaged, the writing is still legible, if barely.\n\nFlipping through the pages, an interesting story unfolds. Good thing you decided to study Orcish.\n\nLike the Trade Prince's yacht, the orcs were fired upon by Alliance warships. You do remember an orc warship that you passed right before the Alliance opened fire. Maybe they were firing on the orcs instead of your ship?\n\nStupid orcs! They got you sunk!",

    "CompletionText": "$n, find anything interesting in the cavern?",
    "RewardText": "Orcs?! They were sunk and stranded too?  And now the Alliance are on the island? Do you think they're going to kill us?\n\n<Sassy looks thoughtful.>\n\nI think it's time for a little sitdown with these orcs.",
