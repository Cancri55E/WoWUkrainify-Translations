    "Description": "Great news! Foreman Dampwick has uncovered a cave full of kaja'mite on the island! What are the odds?\n\nOf course, there's a downside. He took some of the survivors with him to help mine the ore, but none of them have made it out.\n\nCrazy as it sounds, the foreman said that there are monkeys in the cave... with mining picks! They're mining the kaja'mite! How is that even possible?\n\nCan you head southeast to the cavern? The foreman is standing just outside the entrance.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak with Foreman Dampwick outside of the Kaja'mite Cavern on the Lost Isles.",
    "RewardText": "Boss! Er, well, I guess you're not the boss anymore, but still, good to see you!\n\nCan you believe it? We've got a cave full of intelligent killer monkeys mining kaja'mite!",
