    "Description": "Look, I think it's great that we're destroying all of these zombies, even though they're our friends and family. But don't you think we should be taking care of the pygmies that are creating them as well?\n\nAt the three Oostan villages, Nord, Sor, and Ost, there are witch doctors: Gaahl, Malmo, and Teloch.\n\nMaybe you could take care of them? I don't want to be turned into a zombie!",

    "CompletionText": "Um, boss, look, I don't know how to say this, but you might have missed one or two of those pygmy witch doctors.\n\nI'm just saying.",
    "RewardText": "I gotta tell you, that's a load off of my mind. That is, I won't have to worry about no new zombies coming after my brains!",
