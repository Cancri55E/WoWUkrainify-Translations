They were arguing fiercely when they arrived, so I have charged them with fighting side by side.\n\nThis will teach them the strength of friendship, and possibly entertain me in the process.\n\nGo to the north eastern arena and face this jinyu and hozen.\n\nDo not be gentle, they need to learn to work together.",
