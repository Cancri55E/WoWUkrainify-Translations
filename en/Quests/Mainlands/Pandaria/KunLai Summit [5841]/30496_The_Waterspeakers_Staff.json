    "Description": "There is great dissent in Inkgill, $r. Elder Shai Hu drank the sha-corrupted waters of the mere, and forced the others to do the same. When I protested, Orachi of the town guard confiscated my ritual staff and banished me.\n\nNow, I am not only an exile, I am unable to speak with the waters that once gave me guidance!\n\nI am not a fighter. But if you are, perhaps you can recover my staff from Orachi? He is in town to our north.",
