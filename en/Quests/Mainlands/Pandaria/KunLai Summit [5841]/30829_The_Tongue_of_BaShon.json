Plundering the tombs of their old kings for relics of power.\n\nI could not observe them long before having to flee, but I did manage to recover a relic of my own.\n\nThe Tongue of Ba-Shon will let us communicate securely over long distances, but only after I have bound it to myself.\n\nI think I'm ready to begin, if you are.",
