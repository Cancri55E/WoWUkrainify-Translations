He thinks I should be studying my tea pouring while our village is under attack. It's ridiculous! I have just as much courage as any man. I just don't know how to fight... yet.\n\nThat's where you come in. Let me travel with you! I'm a fast learner and I won't get in the way I promise!\n\nPleaseeeeee!\n\nIf we get separated I'll meet you back in the village.",
