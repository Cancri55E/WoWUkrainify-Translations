He mussed up bad.\n\nHe was too lazy to cut seeds out of kafa berries by hand, but he noticed goots eat the berries up and give back the seeds... in a day or so.\n\nHe fed everything he had to the goots on Kota Peak and now they're nuts! Chargin' everything that moves.\n\nKota used to be safe for Grummles to gather kafa. Not anymore. Not with them goots. Will you help?",
