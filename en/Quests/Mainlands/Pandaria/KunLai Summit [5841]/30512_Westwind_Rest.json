    "Description": "<Admiral Taylor winces in pain.>\n\nJade Forest was a disaster. \n\nAnduin's gone. We lost some good people. We didn't stop the Horde from advancing into the continent. \n\nBut I think I've found a way to get the locals on our side. You just helped fight off some of these \"yaungol\", no?\n\nI hear yaungol sacked Westwind Rest, a local village. We've been told that two groups of survivors have camped out along the road west out of town.\n\nWe help them out, maybe they'll consider siding with the Allliance.",

    "CompletionText": "I will not rest until our people are returned and this village rebuilt.",
    "RewardText": "Well... we are alive, and that is better than we could have hoped for without your help.\n\nBut, if this is truly to become a base of operations for you, and if we are to join your Alliance, there is one more thing you must do to guarantee our security.",
