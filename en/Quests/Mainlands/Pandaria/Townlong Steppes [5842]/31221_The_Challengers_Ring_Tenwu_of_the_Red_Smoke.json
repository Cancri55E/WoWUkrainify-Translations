    "Description": "So... you've been challenged by the infamous Tenwu of the Red Smoke.\n\nThat's what he calls himself, at least. He's a good fighter, and a good rogue, but it's a wonder he manages to sneak up on anyone with how loudly he brags about himself.\n\nAnyways, I think you should answer the challenge. Maybe it'll give him a touch of humility. Maybe not. Either way, if you win, he'll probably be willing to go with you on your missions. \n\nAnd I get some entertainment.",
