    "Description": "The Shado-Pan rank among Pandaria's oldest defenders.\n\nFor years we train in our snow-capped monastery high in the Kun-Lai Summit, perfecting the martial secrets passed down by our ancestors.\n\nOur numbers may seem few, but a single Shado-Pan can be deadlier than a hundred trained soldiers.\n\nTo join the Shado-Pan order is a long journey full of hardship. If this is the path you seek, then you must first prove your worth.\n\nThere is urgent work to be done here. Help the Golden Lotus defend the Vale.",
