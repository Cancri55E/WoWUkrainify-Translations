Did it simply hop forward in time, or did it languish in the dark reaches of the Twisting Nether?\n\nThere is one thing for certain: the creatures that inhabit this place are far more than they seem. I sense a hidden power in them, forged by the eons. Seek out the champions of their species, duly marked by their power and prowess, and vanquish five such creatures.\n\nIn death, we may find the clues we seek.",
