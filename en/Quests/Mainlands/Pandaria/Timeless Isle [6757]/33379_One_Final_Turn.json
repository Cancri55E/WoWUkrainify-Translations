I have been using the Vision of Time to gather information, and in my searches, I believe I have found another crux in time. It is in the Caverns of Time itself.\n\nI did not want to believe it when the vision first came to me, but I cannot sit idly by and let this information pass. The Caverns of Time - you must go there, now, and use the Vision of Time.\n\nMove quickly!",
