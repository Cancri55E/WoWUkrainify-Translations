    "Description": "Have you heard about the crisis we're having at the pools?\n\nToads have moved in and are spawning like crazy! It's become a real problem for the lotus farmers.\n\nCoincidentally, I make a jam out of gelatinous toadspawn. I call it \"Bottletoads\" and it's a big hit with the kids around here. Can't keep any in stock.\n\nIf you're heading to the pools, you'd be doing everyone a favor by uh... liberating some of those toad eggs.\n\nInto this bottle. For me.\n\nJust look for bubbles and scoop right in!",
