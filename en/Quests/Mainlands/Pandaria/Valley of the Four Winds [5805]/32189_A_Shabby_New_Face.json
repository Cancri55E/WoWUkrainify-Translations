Claimed they were magic.\n\nI welcome a little competition - business is business, after all - but this gentleman had a certain... shabby look to him. Oh, and he stunk somethin' FIERCE.\n\nWould you check up on him, just to make sure he's on the level? He's over there by Jian Ironpaw, making a meal out of the samples.",
