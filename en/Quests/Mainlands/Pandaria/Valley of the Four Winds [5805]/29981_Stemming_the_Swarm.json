    "Description": "I'm not from here. I've never even BEEN here before today. But even I can tell you that something's wrong.\n\nThat wall over there was built to keep mantid off of pandaren lands.  Now, the mantid are sending their winged scouts over the top, as if the wall wasn't even there!\n\nThe only reason those spindly scouts aren't dying is because they're attacking farmers, not soldiers. They wouldn't stand a chance against someone like you.",

    "CompletionText": "If the flying mantid troops have always been able to fly over, why haven't they before now?",
