    "Description": "Ashyo must have experienced what we call the golden dream.\n\nMany of us working here have seen it, too - often after a long day of toiling in the pools. It is said this vision--and the feeling of elation it brings--is a reward to the mind for working the body.\n\nThere IS an easier way, though we rarely resort to it anymore: a tea can be brewed using lotus root and dreamleaf, which grows around the shrine on the upper tier.\n\nBring the dreamleaf to Yan back in town and he can brew the tea for you.",

So you want to see the Golden Dream, do you?\n\nCome to think of it, I haven't seen the Dream in years - not since I was a cub spending long hours playing in the pools. Long before I took up the culinary arts.\n\nLooks like you brought enough dreamleaf for two cups of tea... so why not?\n\nHere's to better days!",
