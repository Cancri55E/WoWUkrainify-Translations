    "Description": "That poor Ella. She's so shy! I saw her standing in the Halfhill Market, looking really hungry, but afraid to talk to any of the chefs.\n\nWe should bring her some food! And not any boring food - something special.\n\nThe Kunzen hozen make spicy shrimp dumplings from ingredients they've stolen from our farms. I don't like spicy food, but Ella might!",
