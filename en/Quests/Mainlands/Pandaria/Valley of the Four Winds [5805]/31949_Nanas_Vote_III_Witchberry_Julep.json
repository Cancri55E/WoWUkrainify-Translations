    "Description": "Now that we have the water, I can almost taste the icy cold witchberry julep!\n\nNow, we just need to find ourselves some sweet witchberries.\n\nMy grandson's berries this season have been total slop, so I need to seek a decent harvest elsewhere.\n\nSay, do you have any witchberries in the ground this year? How about you bring me some from your farm?\n\nIf your berries are up to the standard, we'll make ourselves a grand old batch of the old juice!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Plant and harvest 3 Witchberries, then deliver 15 Witchberries to Nana Mudclaw.\n\nWitchberry Seeds can be purchased from Merchant Greenfield at Halfhill Market. After tilling and tending your plant, you must wait until the next day to harvest ripe Witchberries.",
