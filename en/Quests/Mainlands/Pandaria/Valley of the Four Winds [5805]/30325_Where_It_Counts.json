Whenever they're getting ready to attack, they participate in strange, barbaric rituals around their totem.\n\nIf we can disrupt this ritual, not only will we put off any impending attacks, we can deal a huge blow to their morale! So get in there, rough them up, and make as much of a mess as possible!",
