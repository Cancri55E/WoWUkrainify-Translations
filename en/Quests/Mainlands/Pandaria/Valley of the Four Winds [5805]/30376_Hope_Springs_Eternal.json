    "Description": "The Shado-Pan are likely dealing with similar outbreaks elsewhere in Pandaria.\n\nSeek out Loon Mai, the Shado-Pan Watch Commander in Stoneplow on the western end of the Valley of the Four Winds. Let him know that we have the situation here under control; the Shado-Pan need not send any aid.\n\nQuite the opposite, in fact - I will be sending many of my followers on pilgrimage, to bring a message of hope to those in need.\n\nThank you again, $p. Farewell.",
