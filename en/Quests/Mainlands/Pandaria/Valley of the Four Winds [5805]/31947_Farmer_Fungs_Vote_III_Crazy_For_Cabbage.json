    "Description": "<Farmer Fung is beaming with a radiant smile.>\n\nThanks to you, I got my precious yaks back! Unfortunately, I noticed that their time out in the wild left them rather gaunt.\n\nThey must be starving, but I don't feed my prize yaks just any regular old grass.\n\nNo sir, they eat only the leafiest green cabbages you can find here in the Valley.\n\nMy stores are a bit low. If you bring me some cabbages for my yaks, I will reward you handsomely.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Plant and harvest 3 Green Cabbages, then deliver 15 Green Cabbages to Farmer Fung.\n\nGreen Cabbage Seeds can be purchased from Merchant Greenfield at Halfhill Market. After tilling and tending your plant, you must wait until the next day to harvest ripe Green Cabbages.",
