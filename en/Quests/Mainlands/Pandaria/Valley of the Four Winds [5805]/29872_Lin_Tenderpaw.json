    "Description": "Lin is more talented than she thinks she is. Strong of fist but weak of spirit. With more confidence, she could be better than all of us.\n\nPerhaps she will find the surety she needs on her trip into the west. She's probably on her way to Stoneplow as we speak. Stop and speak to her, if you find yourself on that side of the Valley.",

    "RewardText": "Oh, it's you!\n\nNo, I haven't found the Hidden Master yet. I probably wasted my time coming out here.\n\n<Sigh...>",
