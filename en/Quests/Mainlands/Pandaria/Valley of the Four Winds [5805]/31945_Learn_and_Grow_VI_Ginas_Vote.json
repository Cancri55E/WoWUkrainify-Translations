    "Description": "My business is doomed! You see all of the Ironpaws at their cooking stations?\n\nTheir tasty dishes draw many of the customers to this market, but they're all out of scallions!\n\nIt may not look like much, but the scallion is an essential cooking ingredient. Without it, foods are less savory, less flavorful, and less aromatic.\n\nThis is terrible. I'm not getting another scallion shipment for a week!\n\nWait a second. You're a farmer, aren't you? You think you could help me?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Plant and harvest 1 Scallion, then deliver 5 Scallions to Gina Mudclaw.\n\nScallion Seeds can be purchased from Merchant Greenfield at Halfhill Market. After tilling and tending your plant, you must wait until the next day to harvest ripe Scallions.",
