    "Description": "I love fishing. I'd be enjoying myself much more, however, if I had my bait and my lures. They were thrown away in a... a misunderstanding with my wife, Rin.\n\n<Gladecaster Lang sighs.>\n\nShould I let a whole day of fishing be ruined, just because of a little domestic squabble? No! All I need is bugs and feathers, after all, and this glade is filled with those two things.\n\nCare to help a fisherman out?",
