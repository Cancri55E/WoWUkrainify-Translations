    "Description": "Things were not always like this, $r. Oh no, they were much, much worse. Not three weeks ago, we were under siege by saurok bandits. They stole our jade, befouled our food stores, and terrorized our cubs.\n\nWe needed a hero, and a hero arrived.\n\nHe drove back their forces, defeated their leader, and returned our stolen jade. All he asked in return was a serpent ride for his niece.\n\nI was never able to thank him. If you are headed to the Valley of the Four Winds, would you relay our thanks?",
