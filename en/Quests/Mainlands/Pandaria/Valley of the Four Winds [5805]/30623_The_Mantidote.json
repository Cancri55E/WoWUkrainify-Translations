    "Description": "<Mei motions towards the battlefield.>\n\nYou see those huge mantid commanders out there? They have a strange aura about them. It reminds me of the sadness we saw at Zhu's Watch.\n\nPerhaps... they're under the influence of the sha, too?\n\nI kept Ken-Ken's mask - the one he used to remove the sha from Yi-Mo. I believe that, if we use it on the mantid, we can convince them to turn back.",

    "RewardText": "It looks like the mantid are definitely under the sway of the sha... the sha of fear.\n\nPerhaps they're not attacking after all - perhaps they are running away from something. What could possibly be on the other side of that wall?",
