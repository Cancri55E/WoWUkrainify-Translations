It's said that he is nearly impervious to pain.\n\nI've injected the melons with a toxic mixture, so don't try eating them!\n\nOnce you get his attention, throw these melons onto the ground. Yip-Yip won't be able to resist a sweet striped melon.\n\nWhen he takes a bite, he'll be temporarily weakened, and you should find yourself an opening to attack.",
