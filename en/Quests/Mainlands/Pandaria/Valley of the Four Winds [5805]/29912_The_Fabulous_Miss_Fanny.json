    "Description": "Most of these vegetables will be sold, but I'd like to keep some for my family. Specifically, my nephew Liang needs some to feed to his pigs.\n\nUnfortunately, the pathway to Liang's farm is currently swarming with Snagtooth virmen. We're going to have to ask Miss Fanny to help us out.\n\nBring some of the food we've gathered to Miss Fanny, who stands next to my house. Then ask her - NICELY! - to send them down to Liang's ranch.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Bring Ang's Giant Pink Turnip, Ang's Summer Watermelon, and Pang's Extra-Spicy Tofu to Miss Fanny, and ask her to deliver them. The food must land on Thunderfoot Ranch.",
    "RewardText": "I understand you're the one who sent the food down from uncle's farm. Thank you.\n\nMy pigs are picky eaters, but those turnips and watermelons are some of their favorites.",
