    "Description": "One of my farmhands, Wika-Wika, has been tilling the soil in my westernmost field. I understand he's had some problems with pests.\n\nHe's got plenty of pesticide to spray the bugs that eat my crops, but I'm afraid he has no way to deal with the marmots.\n\nWould you lend him a hand? With rampant hozen and virmen attacks, I can't afford to lose crops to simple pests.",
