    "Description": "I always was a fan of a good stag hunt. Stags are tough, fast, and territorial.\n\nThey may be plant eaters but they can give any hunter a run for his money.\n\nEast of here is a whole mess of Wilderland Stags just waiting for a hunter like yourself to give 'em a good run.\n\nHappy hunting.",
