    "Description": "The Zandalari use a series of fetishes and charms to maintain their control over their menagerie of beasts.\n\nTwo can play at that game.\n\nI want you to find some of these fetishes and try them out on the various beasts in the Beast Pens.\n\nTake careful note of how each beast responds to each fetish. Then report your results to me.\n\nMaybe this will give us the edge we need against the Zandalari.",
