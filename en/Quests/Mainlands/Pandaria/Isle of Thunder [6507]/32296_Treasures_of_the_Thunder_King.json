    "Description": "My scouts have returned with word that more of the treasures from Lei Shen's tomb are being brought up into the citadel. We have access to a secret sewer entrance, but a door bars us from intercepting the shipment. If we're going to succeed in this raid, we will need a key that only the most trusted of Lei Shen's forces carry.\n\nIf you get your hands on such a key, bring it to me.\n\nYou can keep whatever spoils you steal from our raid. I simply want to see that this shipment never makes it to Lei Shen.",
