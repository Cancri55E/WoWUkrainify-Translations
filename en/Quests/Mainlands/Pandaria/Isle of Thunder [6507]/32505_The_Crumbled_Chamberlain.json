For my dedication, I was condemned to this stone form, forever forced to watch over a portion of his wealth.\n\nSomeone has desecrated my glorious body and sent pieces of it across the island. The thought of spending an eternity as nothing more than a head depresses me.\n\nSearch the island, recover these pieces and I shall grant you one of his majesty's treasures.",
