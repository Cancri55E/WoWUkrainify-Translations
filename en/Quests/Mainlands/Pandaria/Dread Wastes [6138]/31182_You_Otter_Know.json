That's what happened.\n\nThey prefer fresh clams, but they'll pick our crab traps clean if they're hungry enough.\n\nThe otters in Lonesome Cove are protected by law and we run a legitimate operation here. As much as I'd love to chum those little rats and call it a day, we just make sure they aren't hungry enough to raid the crab pots.\n\nToss 'em a few clams to keep them busy while you're out there.",
