    "Description": "Look, I ain't got reason to trust you, but there's a task I can't give to my crew.\n\nI need you to search the wreck of our old ship, the Mist-Hopper, and bring back the charter. It'd be sealed up in a silver tube, in a footlocker.\n\nIt's sort of, uh... incriminating. I can't risk any of the crew finding it if they decide to visit the ol' girl. She's resting on the Shelf of Mazu, to the west.\n\nI'd suggest riding a rip current out there, if you got the stomach. They're all over the shelf.",

    "CompletionText": "To be honest, I hope a grouper ate the old charter.\n\nWait, then it might end up here anyway. Dang it!",
    "RewardText": "That's the charter tube, alright. I guess you'd like to know what all the fuss is about, eh?\n\n<Soggy lets out a long sigh as he un-caps the tube.>\n\nMight as well get it over with.",
