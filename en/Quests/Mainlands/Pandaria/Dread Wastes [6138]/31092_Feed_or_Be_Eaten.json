    "Title": "Feed or Be Eaten",
    "Description": "After years of working with the Kunchong I developed a theory; raising one from infancy would strengthen the bond and therefore strengthen the sonic connection.\n\nI had just begun training Kovok when I was chosen for encasement. He is still very young and will need diligent training to reach his full potential.\n\nI'm entrusting Kovok to you, but be warned; if any harm comes to him your life is forfeit.\n\nFirst, you must feed him to gain his trust. The turtles in the area should be suitable for this.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Begin Kovok's training by feeding him 6 Succulent Turtle Filets found on the Brineshell Snappers in the Briny Muck.",
    "RewardText": "Very good! I had half expected Kovok to just eat you. What a pleasant surprise to see you both in one piece.\n\nPerhaps Kunchong raising is in your blood.",
