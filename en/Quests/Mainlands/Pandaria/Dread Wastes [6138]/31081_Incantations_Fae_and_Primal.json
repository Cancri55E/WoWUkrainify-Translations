    "Description": "I suspect we are going to need the help of these sprites.\n\nWe have two enchanted daggers, bound together with wood and shade. Now we need someone to perform ancient \"incantations\" on our artifact.\n\nBefore we ask for favors, let's show the sprites that we mean well. I heard their leader talking about a pair of mistlurkers that kidnapped several of their villagers. If we slay these fog beasts... we may get the \"incantation\" we need in return.",
