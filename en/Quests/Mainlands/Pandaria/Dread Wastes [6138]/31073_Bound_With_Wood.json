    "Description": "<Vu eyes the recipe.>\n\nHmm... \"bound with wood\". We don't typically brew with wood. Sap, yes... but not wood.\n\nWe have, on rare occasions, infused our drinks with corewood from the treants to the west of here. Most of them have fallen to the mantid... but their remains should suffice for our recipe.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Obtain 8 pieces of Fragrant Corewood.",
    "CompletionText": "We don't brew with wood here. It gives the brew a harsh, insipid flavor, not unlike that of wine.\n\n<Vu spits.>",
    "RewardText": "I'll get these pieces prepared.\n\nWe've already gathered quite a few of these ingredients! I'll have to get a pot boiling soon.",
