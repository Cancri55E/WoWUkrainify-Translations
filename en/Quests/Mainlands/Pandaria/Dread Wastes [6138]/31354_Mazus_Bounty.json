    "Description": "That was some amazing work you and the captain did out there, $p! It's an honor to have you on the crew.\n\nOh! And Ju Lien survived! He swam ashore just after you started letting the harpoons fly. He was raving about some kind of gigantic egg or something that washed in with Jiao.\n\nGo check up on him, will you? He's probably hauled it out of the water by now.",

I spotted it peeking out of the sea floor when I went under - Jiao must have dredged it up while he was thrashing around.\n\nNot really sure what to do with it, but it looks valuable. Seeing as how you pretty much saved all our hides, I think we owe you this catch.",
