    "Description": "Dog ain't my \"pet.\" He's a member of this crew, and my best friend. Saved my life more than once, you know.\n\nBut I'm gettin' too old to walk him anymore, and he still needs his exercise. Take Dog for a trip around the shelf for me, would ya?\n\nHe loves to swim through the hot geysers just southeast of the shallows.\n\nHe absolutely has to... er... \"leave his mark\" on the dead whale at the far western edge of the shelf.\n\nOh, and he'll want to visit our old shipwreck, too. He likes to reminisce.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Take Dog to visit the hot geysers, the whale corpse, and the wreck of the Mist-Hopper on the Shelf of Mazu.",
    "CompletionText": "Dog deserves all the freedom the sea has to offer him - I've tried to set him free, but he won't go.\n\nBest we can do anymore is take him out for walks now and then.",
    "RewardText": "How did it go? I hope he didn't cause too much trouble!",
