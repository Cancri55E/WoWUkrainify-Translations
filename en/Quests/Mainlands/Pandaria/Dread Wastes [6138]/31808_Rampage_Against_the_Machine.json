    "Description": "Kovok has progressed at an astonishing rate. Perhaps the years in hibernation effected his growth process...\n\nWhatever the reason, this could not have come at a better time. I believe it is time to test his abilities.\n\nYou have done so much to aid in his training. It is only fitting that you assist him in his first battle.\n\nI've already guided him to the edge of the scar. Find him and destroy Shek'zeer's army!",
