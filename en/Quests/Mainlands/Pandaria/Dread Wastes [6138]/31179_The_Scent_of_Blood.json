Now, watch them attack me.\n\nPitiful!\n\nDo they think to take vengeance for their fallen? Do they come challenge ME?\n\nI, who have won a hundred wars? I, who stood alone against thousands and still shouted for my enemies to come?\n\nNo, these... saurok... will crumple before me like paper before the flame!\n\nI shall show you my might, Wakener. Fight alongside me and see.\n\nHere they come!",
