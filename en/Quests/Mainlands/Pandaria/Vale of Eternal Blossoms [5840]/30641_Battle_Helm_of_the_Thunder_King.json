    "Description": "The second artifact of power is the Battle Helm of the Thunder King.\n\nEmperor Lei Shen wore the helm into every battle. It became so well-known that his enemies would flee at the mere sight of it.\n\nWhen the Emperor died, they placed the helm in the very bottom of the Guo-Lai Halls to the west, surrounded by thousands of terracotta soldiers.\n\nThus, they could look upon their leader and follow him into death.",
