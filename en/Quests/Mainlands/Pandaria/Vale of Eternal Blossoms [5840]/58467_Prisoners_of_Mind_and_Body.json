By the time I and my Shado-Pan arrived, many of the Golden Lotus had already been taken captive by the Old God's forces.\n\nEven with our combined might, we have only been able to hold off the invaders from taking more of our people. Those already taken, however, are still within the clutches of the Old God.\n\nI know we have had our differences, $n, but if you could aid us in their recovery, the Shado-Pan would be in your debt.",
