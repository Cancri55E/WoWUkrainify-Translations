    "Description": "The invading mantid have been making off with the Golden Lotus' supplies lately. They're probably hoping  they can starve us out.\n\nWell, they may be right if we can't get some of our supplies back. \n\nWhile you're taking the fight to the swarm, keep an eye out for anywhere they might have stashed our supplies. You'd be doing the Golden Lotus a big favor if you could recover some.",
