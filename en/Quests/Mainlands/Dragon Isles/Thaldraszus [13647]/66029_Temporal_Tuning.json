These brief moments are our opportunity to find them.\n\n<Nozdormu conjures a small chrono crystal.>\n\nI have imbued this crystal with power as well as my own temporal resonance. They have gone to a... troubling possible future. Find them and use it. Hopefully you can fix their position in time before they slip away again.",
