    "Description": "The information from our beacons suggests that Elisande has locked the disc away in Astromancer's Rise.\r\n\r\nIt is a place of learning, and the inside will have minimal protection. I have opened a portal where you and the Tyr's Guard will have the least resistance... except for Elisande and whatever guards are under her employ.\r\n\r\nAll of you are on your own once you get there, so try not to muck it up.",
