    "Description": "Shortly before his passing, Keeper Tyr gifted us with a dragon scale forged of purest silver. We kept it in the vaults of Valdrakken during our absence, but I believe it is time to share it once more.\n\nThough we have no idea the purpose for this memento, it has always been a symbol of unity and friendship to us. As a true ally to dragonkind, we would like to share it with you. Speak to me when you are ready, $n.",
