    "Description": "The Primalists caught us completely unawares.\n\n<Velomir spits in disgust.>\n\nMy fellow guardians were ripped apart by these monsters. I would have joined them in death if you had not shown up when you did.\n\nOff in the distance I can still hear the sounds of battle. Perhaps others still live, maybe even Commander Eranog.\n\nLend me your aid. I need you to cause a distraction so I can sneak to a position closer in.\n\nKilling a few of these so called \"Magmasworn\" would be perfect.",
