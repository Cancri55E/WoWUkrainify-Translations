    "Description": "My research team located a strange sanctum nearby. We were able to make out some writing on the outside of it--titan runes, to be exact--which we believe reference Aman'Thul the Highfather, leader of the titans, in several places.\n\nWe tried to inspect more closely but must have triggered the sanctum's defenses. A massive sand amalgam blocked us off and we narrowly made it out alive.\n\nWe aren't certain what it's protecting, but it must be important. Can you investigate?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Find a way to collect the relic hidden inside the Sand-Lost Sanctum, then return it to Nozdormu at the Seat of the Aspects in Valdrakken.",
    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Return to Nozdormu in Valdrakken.",
    "RewardText": "<Nozdormu peers searchingly at the sphere as you hand it over. The sands inside brighten and swirl under his touch.>\n\nI had thought this to be lost in this timeline. Nothing ever remains so, it seems.",
