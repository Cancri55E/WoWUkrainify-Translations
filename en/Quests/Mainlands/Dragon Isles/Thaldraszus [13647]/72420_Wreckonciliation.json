    "Description": "Captain Drine informed me that Alexstrasza wants this done as peacefully as possible. And I've heard Alexstrasza is considering granting the Dragonkin more rights. Or even freedom.\n\nInstead of fighting our way through all these rebels when peace may be on the horizon, let's spread the word! Tell the dragonkin here that things are changing. Perhaps some will lay down their arms or choose to leave.\n\nBut be prepared to deal with those who insist on fighting.",
