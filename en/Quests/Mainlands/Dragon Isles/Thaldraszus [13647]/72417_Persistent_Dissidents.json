    "Description": "My goal is to see this rebellion brought to an end, with as little violence as possible. To do that, I need to understand the root causes of this rebellion.\n\nThe rebels have clearly come to resent the Aspects and the dragonflights. And while we had to use force to protect Valdrakken, that hasn't brought about an end to the rebellion.\n\nI'd like you to speak to the prisoners, and ask why they rebelled. I'll accompany you to hear their reasons.",
