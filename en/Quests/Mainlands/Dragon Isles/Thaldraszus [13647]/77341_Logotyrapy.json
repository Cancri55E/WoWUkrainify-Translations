We all asked him many questions, learning about the titans, ancient history, and what it means to be good.\r\n\r\nBut recently, Tyr has been speaking less, and the answers he does give are shorter and some have an edge to them.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what's wrong, but something is different. Will you come speak with him?\r\n\r\nFor Tyr,\r\nValunei",
