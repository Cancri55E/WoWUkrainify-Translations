Turns out they've found a spell or two that transfers the rocs' innate strength to themselves upon consumption. Especially the eggs!\n\nSave as many of those roc eggs as you can down the cliffs from here. It'll stall the harpies long enough to put my plan into motion.\n\nAnd watch out for rogue elementals. The Cursewives' spell work has stirred them up!",
