    "Description": "The name is Professor Harleen Chirpsnide, infamous ornithologist extraordinaire! I came here to study the mythical bluefeather rocs of the Dragon Isles, but I suppose we've got bigger fowl to fry.\n\nI bet these harpies flew in from Kalimdor when the Isles opened up. They're highly invasive and feasting like a pack of ogres at the Bilgewater Casino buffet.\n\nLet's give the native rocs here a fighting chance. Take this medical kit and use it to get the injured ones back on their feet.",
