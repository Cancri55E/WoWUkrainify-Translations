    "Description": "I really screwed up this time. I only stepped away from the campsite for a moment, but I barely returned in time to see the tarasek snatching up everything I had not bolted down.\n\nThose supplies were expensive, and I can't exactly ask for help getting more! My sister Nori thinks I'm inept enough as it is.\n\nIf you are sure you want to head through the valley, would you mind keeping an eye out for any stray bags of supplies?",
