    "Description": "The threads of time flow like a river, with many bends and branches. Occasionally, those flows can be changed. However, any anomaly left unresolved may doom our destiny to a false timeline.\n\nWe are quickly approaching one of those anomalies. I have sent Chronormu to the Shifting Sands to investigate and correct any issues to the one true timeline.\n\nI foresee that your assistance will be invaluable. \n\nPlease lend us your aid and meet with Chronormu.",
