This is where they carve those runestones and infuse them with primal fire.\n\nNo doubt you noticed the blazing wall of flame that blocks the entrance. I cannot dispel it, however I may be able to do something to help. I believe that with the proper application of Fallingwater, we can pass through it safely.\n\nHarvest water motes from the nearby elementals.",
