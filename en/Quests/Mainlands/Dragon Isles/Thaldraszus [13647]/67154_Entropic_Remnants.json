    "Description": "When an entity passes through the timeways, the sands of time can sometimes accumulate on their body. \n\nTypically, this sand dissipates in short order--but sometimes, the entropic fluctuations inherent in time travel can cause that sand to vitrify. In these cases, it becomes rather difficult to remove. I've ruined several good pairs of shoes this way.\n\nVitrified sand can be quite powerful for our purposes. It would be in best interest to reclaim as much of it as we can.",
