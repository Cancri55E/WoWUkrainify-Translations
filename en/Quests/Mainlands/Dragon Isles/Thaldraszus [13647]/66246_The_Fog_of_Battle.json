My unit attempted to find our leader, Commander Eranog, but before we could get to the other side of the garrison we were cut off.\n\nIn the battle my unit leader, Sergeant Tagrik, held off three Primalists by himself as Kaora, Mikor, and myself battled at his side.\n\nTheir screams are the last thing I remember before I fell. \n\nPlease, $r, if you see any signs of my unit let me know what happened to them.",
