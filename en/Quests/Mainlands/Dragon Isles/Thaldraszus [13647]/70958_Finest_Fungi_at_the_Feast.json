The food composed for fine dining is oft locked behind wealth and means, but we would never allow that at The Ruby Feast!\n\nMorsel has informed me of a perfect ingredient for today's theme. One so rare, so exquisite, that it... does not exist yet! Tantalizing, no?\n\nThe bronze have uncovered a portal to a dangerous future. One where a black truffle with untold flavor exists!\n\nYou must go!",
