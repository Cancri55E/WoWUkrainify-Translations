Getting home is going to be... tricky.\n\nBut we dragons can do it! \n\nWe're going to need you to keep those Black Empire minions off our backs though. It shouldn't take too long! \n\nI think.\n\nProbably.\n\nDon't worry about it! Just keep those creepy monsters away and we'll handle the rest! Easy!",
