    "Description": "After confronting the infinites and, well, myself--we have had a lot to think about.\n\nEternus, one of the infinites, has apparently been thinking a lot too.\n\nThe infinites want to change Nozdormu into his infinite form, Murozond. We don't want that. And after learning about Nozdormu, I think Eternus may be persuaded to not want that either.\n\nI've set up a meeting between Nozdormu and Eternus to get them talking. But I want someone else there... in case something goes wrong.",
