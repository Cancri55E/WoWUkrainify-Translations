    "Description": "A huge fire elemental destroyed the pond a few days ago. I think it's behind all this ruckus, but it's too big to fight. We need to weaken it somehow.\n\nBut don't count Old Gryrmpech out just yet, I have a plan!\n\nWater elementals decided to make themselves at home in the Blue flight's gazebo. If you can collect enough essence from them, we might be able to use their magic against them.\n\nFight fire with fire, right? Well, fight fire with water, I guess.\n\nAnyway, you should probably get going.",
