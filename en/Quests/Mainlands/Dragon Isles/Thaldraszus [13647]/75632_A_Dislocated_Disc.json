    "Description": "As a gesture of good will, Eternus has pledged her assistance in finding the disc that contains Tyr's memories. The infinites have devices that can aid in divining its location.\n\nTo quote Eternus, \"This is a mess Deios made. It is fair we help clean it up.\"\n\nI feel some responsibility as well after our attempt to wake Tyr with the Silver Scale.\n\nMeet Eternus at Tyrhold. She will brief you on her progress. Perhaps now our old friend will finally join us once more.",
