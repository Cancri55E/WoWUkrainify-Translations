    "Description": "The scroll you found is a command that all bluefeather eggs are to be brought to the harpy chef, Fry-Aerie. Apparently, the Screechflight's matriarch won't eat anything that hasn't been properly prepared and seasoned.\n\nSo we'll bring her a special egg of our own. One that's EXPLOSIVELY delicious... and will explode when she eats it. Of course.\n\nHow will you deliver it? In disguise!\n\nSlay the creatures on the lower cliffs, collect up this list of parts, and I'll whip you up a full-feathered outfit.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 20 Screechflight Talons, 6 Screechflight Staves, and 3 Creekborne Cores.",
    "RewardText": "Perfect! And a little gross. Just as I planned.\n\nTime to craft a disguise and take this matriarch out to roost!",
