I've made a huge mistake.\n\nHarleen entrusted me with the famed Feather-Plucker 3300, a phenomenal invention of her very own!\n\nI was planning to pluck roc feathers in the cave south of here for her research, but the harpies ambushed me and it broke into pieces as I was running out.\n\nPlease retrieve the parts! They're probably strewn about like shed scales on the cave floor.\n\nI can put it back together. Definitely. Well, probably.",
