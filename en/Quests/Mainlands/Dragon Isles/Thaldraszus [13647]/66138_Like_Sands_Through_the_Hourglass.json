    "Description": "Like the rest of the gardens, Nozdormu's hourglass has had to weather the elemental unrest. Turbulent wind elementals came through and scattered the magical sand contained within.\n\nWithout this sand, Nozdormu's influence here is greatly diminished.\n\nAs a steward-in-training, I have been tasked with overseeing the hourglass at all times. If you would collect the sand in my stead, I would be eternally grateful.",
