    "Description": "If Alexstrasza truly wants to find the causes of this rebellion, we need to hear out the rebels.\n   \nTo do that, we have to safely detain rebels who want to kill us. Well, you. That's much harder than resorting to violence, and more dangerous as well.\n\nBut I've experienced this when I left the rebels. Orian Darkwater cast a spell to bind me totally. It worked, and I paid close attention.\n\nI've imbued that spell into a ring. You can use it to bind them safely. It should work, anyway!",
