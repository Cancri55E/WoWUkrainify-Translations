    "Description": "This reservoir used to be protected by three warding stones placed by Tyr. \n\nThey were meant to stabilize the elemental magic that is prevalent in the Dragon Isles. \n\nWhen you woke me, I sensed damage done to the west ward. I fear the Primalists may have done this to all of them. \n\nStill, we must assess the damage done in order to figure out what we should do next.",
