    "Description": "Do you not agree that Moraidormi can be saved? We infinites often save those we think suffered needlessly--worthy or not.\n\nSupposedly, Mori died too close to the Caverns of Time just east of us. Using too much time magic here could have... consequences.\n\nBut this should be quick. Chrono-Lord Deios was in possession of artifacts that could forcefully rewind time. The bronze dragonflight has them now. \n\nWe will rewind time and then destroy Vexemia.\n\nSimple.",
