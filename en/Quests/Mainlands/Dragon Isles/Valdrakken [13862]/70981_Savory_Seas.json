    "Description": "The smell of the sea! Do you smell it, $n? Do you smell the multitude of minerals, laden with thick sea salt? Do you??\n\nSuspiciously absent from the delights here today is a rare variety of fish I once tasted near the Iskaara's home in Azure Span. Two Tuskarr fellows were simply roasting one over a fire, and it filled that glacial tundra with the most savory aroma!\n\nSee if you can not find one for us. I know our patrons will be just as ensorcelled by the sea's flavor as I was that day.",
