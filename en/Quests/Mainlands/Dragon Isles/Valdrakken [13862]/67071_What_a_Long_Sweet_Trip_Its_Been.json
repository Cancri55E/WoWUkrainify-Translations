Just who Morsel and I were looking for!\n\nFrom the bottom of both of our winged-hearts, we thank you dearly.\n\nWe started The Ruby Feast to share the Isles' culinary culture with all of Azeroth's races, and to learn from them too. We had you running from one end of our beloved continent to another, but you helped bring our dream vision of these gatherings to each honored visitor and guest here.\n\nAs friends, we would like to give you a gift. Grab the top journal from our hoard behind the cauldron.",
