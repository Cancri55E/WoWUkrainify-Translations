    "Description": "There's a dragon chef in Valdrakken? Truly? I'll have to ask her to try my arclight bisque! It's an old family recipe.\n\nI know the plant you speak of. It grows around streams here, but it's caused some problems.\n\nThe stalks of leapmaize seem to be a natural feeding ground for beetles and small salamanthars, which are, in turn, natural prey of the hornswogs. That's fine if you can spot them out in the open, but there's a few here that are incredibly stealthy.\n\nI'd watch my back if I were you.",
