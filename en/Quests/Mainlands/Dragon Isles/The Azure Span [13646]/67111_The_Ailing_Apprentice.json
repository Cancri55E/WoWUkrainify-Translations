    "Description": "This mission was a mistake from the beginning. Alia Sunsoar enlisted our aid to keep the Sundered Flame from acquiring a dangerous artifact. We had tracked it down to these ruins.\n\nBut the Sundered Flame beat us here and the area is infested with ice spiders. Alia was badly poisoned, and I fear she will not last long without the antidote.\n\nI can make it, but I need venom glands from the nearby spiders. I'm afraid to leave her. Will you find some for me?",
