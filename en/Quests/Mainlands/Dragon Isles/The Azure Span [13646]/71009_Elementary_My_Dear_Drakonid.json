I hate to turn him down, but I left that life behind for the life of a scholar.\n\nI'm trying to uncover the history--and make history. But I'm stumped by this esoteric riddle here in these ancient ruins. \n\nThe riddle is this: if you touch a nearby crystal, it says \"follow the pattern.\" But I haven't the faintest idea what that means!\n\nTell you what. If you can help me crack this riddle, I'll go help Grimtusk finish Frostbite off once and for all.",
