    "Description": "I believe the plant you're looking for has a fine, narrow stem and red leaves all about it.\n\nYou'll be hard-pressed not to run into any of those dastardly crawlers while you're collecting flowers though. I'd advise you steer clear when you can, or ready a sharp weapon when you can't.\n\nAnd let your dragon friend know they can repay me in a cup or two of the stuff next time I'm in the city.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 12 Coldsnap Sagittate leaves.",

    "RewardText": "Ah! This is most certainly the Coldsnap Sagittate! My nostrils are exhilarated! \n\nExcellent work, $n! I am positive our venerable guests will be gargling your praises with each sip of warmth imbibed. Let us not forget to do so with some of these delicious little cakes Morsel and Flemthroat made as well!",
