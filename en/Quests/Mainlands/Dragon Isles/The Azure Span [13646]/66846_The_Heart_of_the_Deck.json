    "Description": "The day the Dragon Isles began their slumber was the day of my very last match. Fate was cruel, and I lost my strongest card before I could compete.\n\nGuo-Hee's card, you see, was mine. I do not know how her ancestors came upon it.\n\nAlas, I cannot claim it as my own as it has been in her family for centuries. That was a foolish mistake on my part.\n\nPerhaps you and I could craft a card together? A truly unique card... Yes! Will you help me?\n\nSpeak to me once you are ready.",
