    "Description": "There! Finished!\n\nMay I present to you... the R.A.D.D.E.R!\n\nDUN DUN DUUUUN! \n\nI have calibrated it to the frequency of the energy surrounding the dragon consoles and inscribed a glyph of dispel magic on it.\n\nThe R.A.D.D.E.R. will dispel the arcane energy and shut down the dragon console, but the glyph will weaken after each use.\n\nPretty handy, isn't it?\n\nI detect four of these consoles in our vicinity. Go shut them down!",
