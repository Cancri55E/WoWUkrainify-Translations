    "Description": "We have strayed from wise Ursol's path, trading focus for obsession and contemplation for fear.\n\nGather cones from the mighty Rustpines. As their roots stretch deep into the earth, take strength from the waters, reach into the winds, and are ripened by fire, they will be a symbol of our renewed commitment to true balance.\n\nTake to the skies on that drake of yours and you should be able to gather enough. The upper branches are the best place to find them.\n\nOffer them to Ursol at his nearby shrine.",
