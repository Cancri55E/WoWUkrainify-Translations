But the elementals running amok around here have made it very difficult to gain even a toehold.\n\nAnd of course it is those wretched gnolls' fault.\n\nThe gnolls have dumped so much refuse, offal, and Light knows what else into the lake that the local elementals have started to go berserk.\n\nBe a dear and clean up a few of the more revolting messes before things come to a head. And, more importantly, before they stain my robes permanently!",
