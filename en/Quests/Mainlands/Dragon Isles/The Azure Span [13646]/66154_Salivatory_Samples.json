Somehow in a single day we've managed to stir up the local gorlocs, lose half of our equipment, and are now down a dwarf. \n\nIn this situation, protocol dictates that we be as efficient as possible. Go thin out some of our toothy antagonists and bring me their saliva for further testing while you're at it.\n\nOnly the good stuff, mind you.",
