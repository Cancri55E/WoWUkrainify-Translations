    "Description": "I've heard whispers while passing through Camp Antonidas. Talk of mutilated fauna being found across the icy steppes. Some nothing more than bloody splatters. \n\nWhatever it is, it's got the mages scared and made the local wildlife scarce.\n\nPoke around the top of the glacier. If I was a betting dwarf, I'd say that's where any apex predator worth its salt would stake its claim.\n\nBring me a piece of it so we can soothe the Kirin Tor.",
