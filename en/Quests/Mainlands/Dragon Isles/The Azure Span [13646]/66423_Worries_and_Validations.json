    "Description": "The deaths of these Sundered Flame underscore how dangerous the Ruins of Karnthar are.\n\nBut Rannan believes that with some tinkering the R.A.D. can still quell the energies here.\n\nAgain, we're treating the symptoms and not the root cause.\n\nSearch the ruins for clues and see if you can discern their original function. And make haste, $n. We may not have much time.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Find clues about the origin of the ruins.",
    "RewardText": "This is... not good news.\n\nIf Sindragosa could not control Karnthar and ordered this station abandoned, I can only imagine the nefarious things that the Sundered Flame could do with it.\n\nWe must not let it fall into their hands.",
