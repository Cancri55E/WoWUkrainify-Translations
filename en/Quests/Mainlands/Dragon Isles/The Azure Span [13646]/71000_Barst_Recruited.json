Did Grimtusk tell you what happened? \n\nAll of us who hunted with Grimtusk thought we were unstoppable. Until we met Frostbite. \n\nFrostbite didn't just defeat us. He humiliated us in front of everyone in the hideaway. \n\nWe were all defeated and left bloodied and battered at the hideaway. Frostbite used us as an example.\n\nNow it's time for payback.",
