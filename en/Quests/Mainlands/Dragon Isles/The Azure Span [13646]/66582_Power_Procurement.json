    "Description": "In normal circumstances, the capture of energy is not problematic. However, the energy we require is massive and unstable. This enchanted vessel should provide a safe means of transport.\n\nThere is a region to the southwest filled with energy-laden creatures. The anomalous energy within these creatures is powerful, but unstable.\n\nCapture their energy and return it to me. Then we may embark on the remainder of this journey together.",
