There's nothing wrong with that, it's what me Pa would have wanted.\n\nNo, the problem is that the fight was a draw!\n\nThe beast's spirit is still out there, as sure as I stand here before ya. But, being a ghost, I can't even reclaim me lucky lure from the critters that picked me body clean to have another go!\n\nWould ya mind helping me out?",
