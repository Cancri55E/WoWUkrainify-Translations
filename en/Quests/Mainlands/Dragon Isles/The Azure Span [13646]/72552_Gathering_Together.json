If it is safe to return home, we should set off soon. But many of us are weak with sadness of the heart--and grumbling of the stomach. I would not put you at risk gathering fresh meat, but could you gather roots for us? \n\nWe have already gathered ones that are close. I hope this comfort food will lift our spirits enough to return!|l",
