    "Description": "Varsek is one of the toughest drakonids you'll ever meet. One of the dumbest ones too, but he'll never admit that.\n\nHe got spooked after Frostbite and started re-evaluating his life or... something. Said he never got to study the ruins left behind by his ancestors. Ran off to be a \"scholar\".\n\nGet Varsek back here. He doesn't belong there anyhow!",
