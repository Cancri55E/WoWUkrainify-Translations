Winterpelt's a right tricky dialect tae learn.\n\nI need ye tae get out there an' find me some furbolg writin' samples tae study if we ever hope tae communicate properly.\n\nThe Primalists've wiped out or converted most o' the remainin' furbolg in the Span, so go shake 'em down until whate'er cultural artifacts they have drop out.\n\nI'll need at least five tae start, but bring me as many as ye can, and I'll keep teachin' ye what I learn.",
