    "Description": "It is time to take the next step to understanding the Winterpelt. That step is a spiritual one. \n\nThey look to their ancestors for advice as they choose their path forward. We can learn from them too.\n\nBut the Winterpelt rite to call their ancestors is... intricate. And long. \n\nIt would be rude to copy their ritual anyway. We'll do it our way with Rustpine Spiritspeaker incense.\n\nCome! Let us reveal their ancestors' wisdom and learn more about our new friends!",
