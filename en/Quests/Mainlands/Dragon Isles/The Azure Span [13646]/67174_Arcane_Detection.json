    "Description": "Greetings! I am Miva Star-Eye, and I am conducting arcane investigations in this area. \n\nThe Azure Span has magic all around it. Some of it is benign... while some can be quite dangerous. \n\nI've been tasked with ensuring no arcane energies reside in anything the tuskarr possess. \n\nWe already had one incident in Camp Antonidas of a fishing box spontaneously combusting! \n\nCan you take my detector and examine a few objects here? I need to continue speaking with Julk over here.",
