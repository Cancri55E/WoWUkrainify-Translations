These are all the work of the greatest painter that ever lived, Hudson.\n\nThey're rare and probably valuable--he's a recluse and hasn't painted anything in awhile. Oh, but I'd love to meet him... Or to learn from him!\n\nYou... seem like the bold type. Would you find him for me? H-here! Take some of my work with you. Maybe he'll be impressed!\n\nOr maybe he'll think I'm terrible... oh dear.",
