It went through my luggage then vanished into thin air! \n\nBut the true horror is that when I woke up... the ghost had taken my most beloved card!\n\nWould you be so kind as to track down the ghost and get my card back? It is my most prized possession.",

    "RewardText": "The apparition explained itself and asked for forgiveness.\n\nBut then they asked to play a single match with me. \n\nOur game is apparently very different from what they used to play, and they wanted to try it.\n\nThank you for helping both of us. Maybe the match will be fun?",
