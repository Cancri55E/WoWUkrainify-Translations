    "Description": "I saw Mordigan run out of there like a dwarf possessed. I'll go chase him down and make sure he gets back to the others in one piece.\n\nIf you hug the cliff and jump down the waterfalls, you should be able to avoid stirring up any more of the gorlocs. \n\nSee you back at camp.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Return to Examiner Rowe in Whaler's Nook.",
    "RewardText": "It appears you've managed to return our dwarf. And in a single piece, no less. On behalf of both our team and the Dragonscale Expedition, I thank you. \n\nWe'll get Mordigan some fluids, then start packing up. \n\nThere's nothing in these hills save blood and salt.",
