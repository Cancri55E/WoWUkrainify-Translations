    "Description": "The gang had some time off and was hankerin' for a pint, so we bellied up to the inn.\n\nBut, ach! I can nae believe it! They didna have any brew! What kind o' inn is that? One ran by the Stonehinges--that's what kind!\n\nSo we're takin' matters into our own hands! The forest to the east has flowers and herbs that we could use to brew some sweet mead. Feel like helpin' me and doin' some flower pickin'? There'd be somethin' in it for ye!",
