    "Description": "Have you heard the tale of the Gleamfisher? She built a boat strong enough to pass down waterfalls! \n\nElder Nava loves to tell the story.\n\nI think the noble spirits of the On'tuq mammoths would be honored if we used their remains to craft such a boat again.\n\nMy brother says no. But if we succeed, we can help bring fish to our struggling sister tribes.\n\nYou've proven your skill and passion! Together, I'm sure we can build something great.",
