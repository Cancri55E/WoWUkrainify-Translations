    "Description": "Now for this ley line. It looks like my fears were correct -- the decay has spread into the line itself.\n\nWe'll need to purge the decay and speed along the healing process, but I can't channel enough energy with my mirror image alone. \n\nFocus yourself on this ley crystal here. My connection with you will help me teleport here physically. Then, I will be strong enough.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Focus on the Ley Crystal, then destroy 3 Decay Infections.",
    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Find Kalecgos outside Brackenhide.",
    "RewardText": "We did it. Great work, $n. Breathe the fresh air again!\n\nWith this ley line restored, and Khadgar finishing up on the one in the tower, the Oathstone should be ready to claim. I must return to the Azure Archives shortly.",
