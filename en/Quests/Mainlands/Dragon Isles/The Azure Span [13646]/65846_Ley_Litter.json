    "Description": "The ley line is here--I can feel it! \n\nBut first, we must stop the gnolls. That ancient will be their greatest weapon.\n\nThere are some ley crystals the gnolls have gathered. Thankfully, they don't seem to understand the power that the crystals hold. \n\nBring me as many as you can. They'll empower my mirror image and help me summon something useful from the Archives to take that monster down!",
