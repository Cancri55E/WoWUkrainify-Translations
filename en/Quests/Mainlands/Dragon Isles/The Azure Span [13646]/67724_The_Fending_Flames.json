We haven't even fought the Sundered Flame yet, and the spiders may do us in before we can!\n\nWe need to keep them at bay. \n\nThankfully, there's a natural way to repel them. Burning silk from their cocoons creates an aroma that repulses the spiders.\n\nGrab some silk and I'll throw it on the fire. It'll keep them away!",
