    "Description": "If you're looking for an instructor, I'm sorry to say I... Ah, you're not an apprentice! My apologies. Allow me to introduce myself. \n\nI am Custodian Vernagos, one of the caretakers of these ruins. More specifically, the task of restoring this workspace to its former glory has fallen upon my very tired shoulders. \n\nWould you be able to lend a hand? All the reagents I need are nearby: ice elemental cores, embercones, hornswog leather...\n\nFairly standard, easily gathered stuff. What say you?",
