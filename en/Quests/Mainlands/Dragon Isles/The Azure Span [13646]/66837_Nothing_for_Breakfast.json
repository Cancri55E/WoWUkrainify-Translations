    "Description": "My brother Valdo was supposed to order more supplies. But it's been a week and nothing has come. \n\nI'm not surprised. The lazy oaf probably took a nap instead! Now we're short on food, and I'm too busy to hunt on top of my chores--and Valdo's! \n\nWould you hunt for us? The meat of the vorquin striders and striped bruffalon south of here would keep the kitchen open until I can order supplies.",
