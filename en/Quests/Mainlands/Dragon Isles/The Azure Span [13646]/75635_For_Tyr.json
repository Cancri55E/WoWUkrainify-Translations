I'm sure you played no small part in that.\n\nThere's one final step we need to take before I can formally induct our recruits as full-fledged members of the Tyr's Guard: the Tyr's Guard initiation ceremony. \n\nIt would make me proud if you stood with us on the steps of Tyrhold as I formally reforge the Tyr's Guard. Will you join us?",
