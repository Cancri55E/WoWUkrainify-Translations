    "Description": "I am sorry you have been dragged into this, traveler. \n\nMy brother tends to get... carried away. This is only the latest of his follies. But this one might get him killed. \n\nHe won't listen to me. He probably won't listen to you, either. \n\nOur ancestor, Kauriq the Gleamfisher, though, is the center of his fixation. She may be able to.\n\nPlease catch some Gleamfish and bring them here. I shall use them to help us commune with her spirit, which lingers in this stone.",
