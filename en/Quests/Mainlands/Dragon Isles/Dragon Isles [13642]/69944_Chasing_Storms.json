    "Title": "Chasing Storms",
    "Description": "Well, that wizard certainly knows how to make an entrance, doesn't he?\n\nWe won't be able to set sail until someone gets those elemental storms under control.\n\nCheck-in with Storm Huntress Suhrakka. She's leading the expedition efforts to investigate the storms and can help outfit you with whatever gear you need.\n\nWhile you handle that, I'll coordinate the rest of the preparations. At least it'll give me some time to read a few more volumes on dragon history before we set sail.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak with Storm Huntress Suhrakka at the zeppelin tower.",
    "RewardText": "These storms are wild, dangerous things. If you wish to confront them, you'll want extra protection.\n\nIn my years of hunting, I've gathered many things that helped ward against the wrath of the elements. Perhaps some of them may be of use to you as well.",
    "Objectives": []
