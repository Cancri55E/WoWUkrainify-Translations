    "Description": "The Primalists' attack left its mark on the Emerald Gardens. I wish to see it grow and flower once again.\n\nIn this part of the garden, we have an overabundance of lashers. Their seeds can be used by the Sisters of the Garden to cultivate vegetation in those damaged glades.\n\nThin out the lashers to collect their seeds, and then give those seeds to the Sisters. They sometimes struggle to inflict harm on any creature, even when it is in the best interest of the gardens overall.",
