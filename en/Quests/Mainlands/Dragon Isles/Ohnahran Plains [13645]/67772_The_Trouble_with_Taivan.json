    "Description": "Hello, friend. Welcome back to Maruukai. I am Selbekh, healer of Clan Teerai.\n\nAre you good with animals, $n? Perhaps the influence of a newcomer is just what I need.\n\nTaivan here, while a very good companion, has become something of a burden on my clan. I'm afraid if we can't find a good use for him, I may have to send him away. Will you help me?",
    "ObjectivesText": "Help Healer Selbekh prepare Taivan for training.",
    "RewardText": "What brings you to the Shikaar hunting grounds, stranger?\n\nThe Teerai would like us to train your bakar as a hunter? We do not usually accept such requests from other clans, but I will consider it. Her gift is quite generous, and a fully-trained beast of his size would be a sight to behold. I bet he could take down a bull mammoth all on his own!\n\nHmm... I will have to see him in action before I make my decision.",
