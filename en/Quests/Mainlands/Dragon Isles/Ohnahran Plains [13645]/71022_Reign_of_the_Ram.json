    "Description": "Since the argali don't seem to have much respect for Taivan, we should see if he can handle the herd's ram next.\n\nHe's the boss of all the argali here, and quite the stubborn thing. If Taivan can assert dominance over the ram, the herd will start obeying him.\n\nYou can find him just over there, on the hill. Good luck, Taivan. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid there's not much hope for him being a herder!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Command Taivan to confront the herd's Stubborn Ram.",
    "RewardText": "That could have gone better. Sorry, friend, but I don't think Taivan is cut out for this. \n\nHe's a very nice bakar, but doesn't quite seem smart enough to figure out how to get the argali into the pen, or aggressive enough to take command of the herd away from the ram. \n\nI'm afraid I'm going to have to send you back to Selbekh with bad news.",
