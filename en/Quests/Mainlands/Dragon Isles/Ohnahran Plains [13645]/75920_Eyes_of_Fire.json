    "Description": "This area is swarming with far more Primalists than I expected. Fyrakk does not generally travel with guards, so I doubt the Primalists are here to accompany him.\n\nThey seem to be trying to establish a foothold here. But why? \n\nPerhaps whatever the Incarnates are discussing will answer that question.\n\nIn the meantime, let us thin out the Primalists guarding this area. We cannot risk having them in full force behind us as we cross the bridge.",
