If you proceed any further, you too will surely succumb to their madness.\n\nBe it through your nurture or your nature, the call you hear is a physiological one. You have a craving that must be sated.\n\nIt brings me great shame to say that I possess the means to feed this malediction. It will not quite be the same, but you will be able to function... For now.",
