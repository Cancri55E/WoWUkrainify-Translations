    "Description": "I'm grounded indefinitely! Doesn't my Ohn know I'm turning sixteen next spring? I should be able to leave when I want to.\n\nYou look like you could help me out. I do have an escape plan: by channeling these totems, I'll concentrate the air and create quite a stir. But I can't go around placing them, because I'm under maximum wind watch. Even Togo won't help me.\n\nBut with your help... Please! I promise I'll show you something cool.",
