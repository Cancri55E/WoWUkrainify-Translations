    "Description": "There is a small pond by the Mirror of the Sky where Narman and I first met during my initiate training.\n\nInitiates travel up there to be closer to Ohn'ahra so they may feel the wind. I first saw him in the reflection of the water when a sudden breeze opened my eyes. It is the most beautiful sight in all of the plains.\n\nIt will be the perfect place for our proposal.",
