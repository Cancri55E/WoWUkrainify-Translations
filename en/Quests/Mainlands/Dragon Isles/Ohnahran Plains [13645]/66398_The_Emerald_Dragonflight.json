    "Description": "If we are to eradicate the Primalists from the Emerald Dream, the one place we must secure is Lunedane. According to my son, that is where Rymek has gone.\n\nIt is the last line of defense for the nascent Tree. There, an ancient artifact shields the Tree from being found. And, it is powerful enough to expel all our enemies at once.\n\nI do not know if my mother has the power to command and use it anymore. But we will deal with that once we have found and stopped Rymek.\n\nFly with us, as one.",
