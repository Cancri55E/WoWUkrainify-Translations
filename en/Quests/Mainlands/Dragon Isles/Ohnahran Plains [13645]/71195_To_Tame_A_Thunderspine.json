    "Description": "I guess this is Lizi's new favorite spot. She hasn't been interested in coming back home. After all, she is a wild beast.\n\nI have to tell you... I haven't spoken to Meluun since we saved Lizi. I know she was right, but I don't know how to approach her. She doesn't seem to approve of anything I do. I know I have to focus more on my training.\n\nMeluun makes a stomping good curry that Lizi would love. Do you think you could ask her for it? She's usually working in the Ohn's house west of the springs.",
