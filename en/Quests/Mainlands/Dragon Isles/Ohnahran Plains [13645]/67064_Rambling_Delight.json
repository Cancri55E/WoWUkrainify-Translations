    "Description": "Oh, Rumiastrasza! Myself and the dryad sisters, Celina and Felina, had a lovely evening cooking for her.\n\nThe kelp we ate is a unique strain called Glimmering Ramblekelp. Swarms of frillfish devour them all along the coast. I wouldn't be surprised if they attack you while you're plucking their food from the sea floor.\n\nPlease give the chefs my best when you see them. They're always welcome here in our sanctuary.",
