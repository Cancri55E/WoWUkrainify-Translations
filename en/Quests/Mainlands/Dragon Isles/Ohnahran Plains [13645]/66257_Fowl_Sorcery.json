    "Description": "It is said that Ohn'ahra infused the spear of our ancestor, Maruuk, with her power. Balakar Khan must have told the Primalists about that legend.\n\nThey have stolen the magic from Ohn'ahra's children, polluted it with storm sorcery, and infused it into ballista bolts. Why would the Nokhud need such weapons?\n\nWe shouldn't wait to find out. These storm bolts are being loaded into wagons for transport. Take my totems and place one atop each wagon you come across. My wind magic will smash them to pieces.",
