    "Description": "Our next path is through Nokhud territory. Historically, we have been at a tentative peace with their clan, but times have changed. \n\nIf we do not act first, we leave ourselves open while we're vulnerable. My scouts have reported that one of their war leaders has been spotted near Dragonsmeet. Take the fight to her directly - do not let her gather the forces to assault us on the move.",
