    "Description": "We have a teensy problem I could use your help with. But it's... complicated.\n\nSome time ago, King Varian Wrynn was in a gladiator trio with Broll Bearmantle and Valeera Sanguinar. Those three just showed up in this 'Field of Ferocity' place and they're not only taking on all challengers, they're beating them too! They won't return through our portals until they lose.\n\nDo you think you could find some friends and defeat them? We'll be able to convince them to go back if you can, I'm sure of it!",
