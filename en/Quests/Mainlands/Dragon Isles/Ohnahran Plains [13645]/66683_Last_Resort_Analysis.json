My brother will get all the credit, and no one back home will be surprised.\n\n<Watu looks up.> What? What's that you've got there? Glowing rocks? I'll look at one, but take the rest to somebody else. I'm a hunter, not an archaeologist. <Watu snorts, glaring at his leg.> Maybe this is a sign for me to switch jobs. Go on, you've proven more useful than I.",
