That feels... wrong.\n\nBut there might be a way I can set things right. Ysera is the only one who can help us get control of Ancient Bough again. I think I can help bring her back.\n\nIt's getting harder and harder to cross over. We need to make this count.\n\nTyrande and Malfurion will meet us there.",
