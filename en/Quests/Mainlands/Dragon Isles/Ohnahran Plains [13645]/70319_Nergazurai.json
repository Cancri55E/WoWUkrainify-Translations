    "Description": "My uncle told me many tales of his battle with a hornstrider named Nergazurai. He told me of its fuchsia scales weaving through the hills of the plains as it seeks its prey, its razor-sharp talons and venomous bite.\n\nWhile I was out hunting I saw the flash, but it was too late; it left me with a nasty bite in my shoulder. He was as terrible as my uncle described, but I came out alive.\n\nI need to clean the infection from his bite. Please, collect the reagents I need. Time is of the essence.",
