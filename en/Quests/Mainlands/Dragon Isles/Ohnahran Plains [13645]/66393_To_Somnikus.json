    "Description": "Somnikus has been melancholy and agitated since the death of his son.\n\nThough we have all endured loss, I cannot imagine what I would feel were something like that to happen to Gerithus.\n\nGo with Rymek to the isle, and see if there's anything we can do. Somnikus suspects that the Primalists are on the verge of another attack. I fear that he may do something rash.\n\nDo not worry. Because of your help with the Emerald Oathstone, you can cross the barrier easily.",
