    "Description": "While most of our wool comes from our own argali flocks, we do sometimes need to pull from the land when the flock grows thin.\n\nThe nearby plains are home to wild argali - they tend to be more temperamental than our clan's flock. If you could take this blade and attempt to shear their wool, it would be a great service to Aylaag.",
