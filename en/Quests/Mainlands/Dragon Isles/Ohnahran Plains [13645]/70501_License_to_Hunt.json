    "Description": "Ah, finally ready to prove yourself as a hunter? Keep in mind this is not as simple as running around and hunting everything that moves. The Shikaar hunt with purpose. We hunt to feed and clothe the clan, to prove our strength against mighty foes, and to balance nature.\n\nWe do not hunt the land barren, we sow the seeds for future Grand Hunts as we go. Prove yourself capable of following these instructions and you may join us.\n\nHowever I do not have confidence in your friend there succeeding.",
