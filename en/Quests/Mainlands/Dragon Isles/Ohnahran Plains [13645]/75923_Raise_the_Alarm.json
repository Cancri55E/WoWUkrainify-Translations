    "Description": "So the Druids of the Flame have allied with Fyrakk to help him invade the Emerald Dream.\n\nThey were able to turn that keeper to the flame with hardly any effort. Fyrakk must be bolstering their power, perhaps as payment for their aid in accessing the Dream.\n\nWe need to mobilize troops immediately to find every Druid of the Flame on the Dragon Isles and stop them.\n\nGo to Captain Drine in Valdrakken and alert her. She will dispatch the drakonid.\n\nI will go to Merithra and handle things here.",
