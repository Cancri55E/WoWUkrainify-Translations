    "Description": "I shared with Tigari Khan the omen we received before entering Maruukai. She expressed her concern, as the wind felt cold to her as well.\n\nWe cultivate certain flowers here, blooms that can be ground and burned to elicit a trancelike effect. They are used to deepen our connection to an omen. \n\nI request that you collect some so that we may make an incense to burn. With my khan's help, perhaps we can learn more of Ohn'ahra's plight.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 5 Sweetsuckle Blooms, grind them into Sweetsuckle Incense, then aid Ohn Seshteng in the ritual.",
    "RewardText": "A betrayal threatens Ohn'ahra herself. We must stand tall, $n. Now is a time for allies.",
