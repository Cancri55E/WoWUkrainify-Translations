    "Description": "$n, I have heard you cultivated good relations with the centaur of the Ohn'ahran Plains. I would like to ask a favor.\n\nBaine left for the plains a few days ago in search of a group of missing tauren. I offered to accompany him, but he insisted on going alone.\n\nThe tauren of Thunder Bluff have a long and bloody history with the centaur of Kalimdor, as does Baine. While the Maruuk centaur are unrelated, I still have my concerns.\n\nYour presence could help smooth tensions. I hope.",
