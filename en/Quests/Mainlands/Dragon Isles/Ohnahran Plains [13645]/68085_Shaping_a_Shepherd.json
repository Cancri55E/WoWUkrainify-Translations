    "Description": "You want me to train your bakar in shepherding? Well, that's certainly what we do here, but I've never trained one quite so BIG before...\n\nThe argali don't seem to be bothered by his presence, though, and they're very good judges of character. Trust me. \n\nI'm willing to give him a shot, but a herding bakar needs to not only be gentle, but smart, too. And if they aren't able to take charge of the herd, the argali won't obey them. It's harder than it looks! Go on and give it a try, I'll watch.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Teach Taivan to herd argali at the Mallakh.",
    "RewardText": "Hmm... Taivan still seems confused. He just doesn't seem to be grasping this.\n\nYou did great, though! Are you in the market for a new career?",
