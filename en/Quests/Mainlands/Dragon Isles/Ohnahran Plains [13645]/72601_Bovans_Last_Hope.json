    "Description": "If Bovan is not here, the Nokhud could have taken him anywhere. We might have one last chance to find him, but it's a long shot.\n\nWe still have Bovan's necklace. One of the Ohn'ir mystics might be able to use it to help divine his location. I've only heard about this ritual, so I have no idea if it will work.\n\nGo to the Ohn'iri Springs and look for Boku. I'm sure he will help us.\n\nBaine and I will make sure the tauren we rescued get back safely. We'll meet you at the Ohn'iri Springs.",
