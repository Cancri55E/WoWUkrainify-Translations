    "Description": "Greetings friend!\n\nI've been looking for a good place to set up fishing nets around here, but it seems like the population of waddlers around here is too dense - they're eating away most of the juvenile fish before they get a chance to mature.\n\nI've made some effigies to scare at least some of those ravenous birds away. This will help us sustain the abundance of fish across the Dragonsprings. \n\nCan you help me setting those up?",
