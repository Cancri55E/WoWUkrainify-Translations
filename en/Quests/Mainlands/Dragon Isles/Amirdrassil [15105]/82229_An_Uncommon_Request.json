    "Description": "$n, welcome to Bel'ameth. I wonder -- do you have time for a small favor?\n\nEarlier today, a young kaldorei named Kelestra came to see me. She sought permission to bury her family in a barrow den. An uncommon request, but I gave her my blessing and directed her to the Barrows of Reverie. \n\nShe looked... melancholy. After she left, it struck me that she might be the last of her family still alive. If you have the time, could you check on her?",
