    "Description": "Fine thread may conjure images of tailory, but it can serve a vital role in leatherwork as well.\r\n\r\nSome of the Dream's hardier flora can be processed into a thread strong enough to secure even the thickest of hides and scales. If you happen upon any dense fiber during your travels, you would be well-served by bringing it to my colleague in the Dream.",
