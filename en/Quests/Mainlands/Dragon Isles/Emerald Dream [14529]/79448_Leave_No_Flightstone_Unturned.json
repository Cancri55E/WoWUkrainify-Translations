    "Description": "It's so exciting to be in Valdrakken! Cuzolth and I have never been here before. And it's everything we hoped it would be. Some of the others have even introduced themselves. They actually thanked us for our work studying Flightstones and Crests. That's every researcher's dream!\n\nSo I need your help again. Could you find some Flightstones and a new piece of adventuring gear? Then come back to Cuzolth for an upgrade? It would really help us solidify our new position here.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Acquire 50 Flightstones by defeating unique creatures, conquering dungeons and raids, completing world activities, or by looting caches. Then speak to Cuzolth and upgrade a piece of Season 4 equipment using Flightstones.",
