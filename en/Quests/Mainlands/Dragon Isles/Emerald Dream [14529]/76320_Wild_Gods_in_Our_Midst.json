We will need their strength and their power to counteract the damage that Fyrakk has brought to this realm.\n\nThe first to seek out is Goldrinn. The ancient wolf has a fondness for Azeroth and mortals, so he is sure to aid us.\n\nOthers may need more convincing. \n\nI will meet you nearby in the Fields of Reverie, where dryads and keepers reside.",
