    "Description": "Lilian and I have been shadowing Raelas Firewind and have uncovered his plan. He has manipulated the Sisters of the Flame to bind spirits from the Dream to magical spirit stones.\r\n\r\nWith Raelas's blessing, these stones became powerful tools of corruption, allowing these fallen dryads to twist the Dream and its denizens.\r\n\r\nWe will start our purge with the dryads--they have the stones. Then we will end Raelas.\r\n\r\nThe hunt begins, $n.",
