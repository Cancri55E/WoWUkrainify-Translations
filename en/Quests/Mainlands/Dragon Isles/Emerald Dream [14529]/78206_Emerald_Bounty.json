    "Description": "There are so many more species to locate and study. As you explore the Dream, you will find more seeds known as Dreamseeds. Please, nurture them to continue our studies, and enjoy the bounty they share with you!\r\n\r\nYou will find Dreamseeds all over, but many are hoarded by powerful creatures around the Dream.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you should keep an eye out for the surge of life energy we call an Emerald Frenzy. It will be a source of many Emerald Dewdrops, which will help in nurturing Dreamseeds.",
