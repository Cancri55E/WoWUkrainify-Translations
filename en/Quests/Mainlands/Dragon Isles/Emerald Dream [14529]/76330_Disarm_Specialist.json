The djaradin plan to use suffused weapons to turn the tide of the battle.\r\n\r\nWe must dispatch their smiths and destroy their weapons. Targeting both will weaken and slow them. Then we will have time to consider our next move.\r\n\r\nYou will be in great danger on this mission. Take this. \r\n\r\nThrowing it onto enemies will temporarily put them to sleep. Use it so that you may avoid becoming overwhelmed in combat.\r\n\r\nGood luck, $n.",
