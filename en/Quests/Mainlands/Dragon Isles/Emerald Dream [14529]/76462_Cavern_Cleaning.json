    "Description": "This cave is adequate. It has a commanding view of the surrounding land, and is highly defensible.\r\n\r\nBut the state of it is not acceptable. \r\n\r\nI will place an enchantment upon you. When you draw near to the smaller spiders, it will freeze them, allowing us to relocate them. The sacs and larger spider will need to be addressed with more... finality. \r\n\r\nSee that it is done.",
