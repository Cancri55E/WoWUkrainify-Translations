    "Description": "I hear there is a legendary engineer in the Dream who crafts the most beautiful dream catchers.\r\n\r\nThis engineer, Nyla Bushtail, enjoys acorn-flavored morels and relies on them to fuel her work. Acorn-flavored mushrooms... certainly strange, but perhaps not unheard of.\r\n\r\nThere's a coastal area close to the Eye of Ysera where these morels grow abundantly. Do tread carefully around any wildlife in the area. If these morels are as tasty as I hear, they will be guarded greedily.",
