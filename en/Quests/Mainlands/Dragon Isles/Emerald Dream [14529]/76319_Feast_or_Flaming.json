    "Description": "Already Fyrakk damages the fabric of the Dream. I can feel it burning, as if flames were consuming my scales.\r\n\r\nAnd I know that simmering agony is only a fraction of what my son felt when Fyrakk tormented him. \r\n\r\nBut we have a potent weapon against this fire. Our faerie drakes and dragons consume what does not belong here. They are excellent allies, if a bit difficult to manage.\r\n\r\nNow they need our help. Use this. Clear the skies of encroaching flame.",
