    "Description": "Dionaessa's connection to Cenarius gives her the ability to grow plants, but she needs space to practice.\n\nThe stirred-up wildlife here will be in your way. The Twisting Wood nearby will have plenty of space with far fewer hooves.\n\n<Melyrine smiles. Her eyes shine with intensity.>\n\nIf she gets poisoned by a podling, don't worry. Dryads are immune to poison. You are not.",
