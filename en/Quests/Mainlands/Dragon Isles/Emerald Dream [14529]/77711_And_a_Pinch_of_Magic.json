I never suspected that someone who couldn't even find their own bucket, could do something like this.\r\n\r\nI think the sapling is almost there, and with my help we can bring it the rest of the way.\r\n\r\nTake this totem and place it near some of the weakened, flame-corrupted Roottenders found in the Singing Fen. This should siphon the unstable magical energies out of their bodies and transform it into something we can use.",
