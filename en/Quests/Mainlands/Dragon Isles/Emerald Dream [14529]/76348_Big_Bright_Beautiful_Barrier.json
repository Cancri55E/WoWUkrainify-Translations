I do not know what his plan is, but he ordered me and these Primalists to bring down this barrier.\r\n\r\nWe have made little progress, but Vyranoth will want us to slow him down.\r\n\r\nSome fragments of the barrier have chipped away. If you collect them, we can channel their energy back into the shield.\r\n\r\nCan I trust you to undo the damage that I have done?",
