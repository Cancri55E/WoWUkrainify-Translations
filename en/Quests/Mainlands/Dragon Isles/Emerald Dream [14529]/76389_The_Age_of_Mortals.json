    "Description": "Once again, the mortal races have come together to defend a World Tree. It is only fitting then that we bolster their efforts with a relic from that past battle. The Horn of Cenarius.\n\nI entrust the horn to you, $n. Use it to bestow the blessings of Cenarius to our allies. With luck, it will allow us to break through Fyrakk's forces and open a path to the temple.\n\nAnd do not forget to lend your strength as well. Every enemy felled is one fewer between us and Fyrakk.",
