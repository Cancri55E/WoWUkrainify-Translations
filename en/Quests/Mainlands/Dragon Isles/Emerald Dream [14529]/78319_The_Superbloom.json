We need all the help we can get.\n\nDuring the ritual, Sprucecrown will draw on the magic of the Dream to grow Dreamfruit. Consuming these will grant you amazing powers. Only a few of these powerful and delicious fruits can appear. Keep an eye out for them!\n\nPray lend a hand, hero, and the dream will reward you aplenty.",
