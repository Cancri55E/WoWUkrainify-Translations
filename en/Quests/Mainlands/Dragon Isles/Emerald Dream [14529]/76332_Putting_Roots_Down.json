    "Description": "Our trap is many-layered.\r\n\r\nPlant these seeds around town. Our gardeners have already prepared the soil. These plants will be effective tools to poisoning our enemy. Handle them carefully, for some may sprout sooner than later.\r\n\r\nAlso, Kiya Featherpaw, our umbraclaw keeper, has an idea to mobilize the very strong creatures. Go speak with her.\r\n\r\nFinally, meet with Somnikus to give everyone the signal that battle is imminent.",
