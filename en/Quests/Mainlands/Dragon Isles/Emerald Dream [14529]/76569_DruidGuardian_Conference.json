    "Description": "Typically, the druid assigned to a dryad sanctuary would guide a newborn dryad until they were ready to take on a position of their own.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to separate a dryad from whoever she imprints on.\r\n\r\n<Ethidris sighs and rubs his eyes.>\r\n\r\nWhich she has made very clear.
