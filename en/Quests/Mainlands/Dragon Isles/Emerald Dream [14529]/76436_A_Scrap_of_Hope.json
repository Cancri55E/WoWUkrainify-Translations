    "Description": "It is only a matter of time before Fyrakk's forces decimate our own. And then there will be nothing stopping him from entering the Wellspring Temple.\r\n\r\nIf the Prophet of the Flame is responsible for blocking our reinforcements from entering the Dream, there must be some record or communication of his plan. We just have to find it.\r\n\r\nSearch for any communications amongst Fyrakk's forces at Skystone Falls. If we can disrupt their efforts in some way, we might have a chance to turn the tide.",
