I have asked our ground forces to investigate, but they are blocked at every turn.\n\nTwo fire elementals in particular stand against us, empowered by Fyrakk's shadowflame.\n\nYou must clear the area of enemies. I have imbued this scale with my magic. Use it to weaken the elementals and any other who stands in your way.",
