Fragments of dream magic are being left behind by the creatures here.\n\nI'm curious to know the effects of such magic in concentrated doses. But I need someone to extract it for me.\n\nThere are some problematic lashers and podlings to the south of here. \n\nSeveral of them should be enough for a lesser infusion.",
