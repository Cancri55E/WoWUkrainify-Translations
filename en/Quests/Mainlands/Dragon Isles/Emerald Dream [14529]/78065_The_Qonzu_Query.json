However, we need all the aid we can gather.   \r\n\r\nYou must discover why they refuse to aid us and convince them of the right path. Q'onzu and I have a rather strained relationship. Your efforts could bear more fruit. \r\n\r\nI hear Q'onzu has built a nest near Shiversnap Grove. Would you go and approach them?",
