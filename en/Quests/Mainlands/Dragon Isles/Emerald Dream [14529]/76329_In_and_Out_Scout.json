    "Description": "Bodwin reports that Galok is not the only new threat to the Eye. The djaradin forces below are led by two others--a warrior and a mage.\n\nIt is unwise to engage them directly in their own, well-established base. But I am certain they are a part of Galok's plan of attack.\n\nPlease gather more information from these djaradin leaders. We need to know how best to counteract their attacks.  Bodwin can grant you stealth so that you may move unseen in the camp.",
