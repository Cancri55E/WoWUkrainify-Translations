    "Description": "I knew coming into this that Shandris likes to work alone, but letting us know where she's going would be nice.\r\n\r\nNot a great turn in our professional relationship.\r\n\r\nKeeper Silas won't speak to me...\r\n\r\nWe should take a look around the camp. Maybe she left a note or some clue... maybe in her mission log?\r\n\r\nTake a look, and see if you can get anything out of Silas. \r\n\r\nI'll wait here in case she comes back.",
