    "Description": "So, you think yourself worthy of a Stormrider's armor?\n\nWe Stormriders were titan-made to fight and to ride stormrooks. Even so, we must prove our competence in battle before we gain clearance to wear Stormrider armor. I see no reason why you should not undergo the same challenges.\n\nGo. Show me you have the power of the storm within you.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Collect 50 Storm Spirits by slaying powerful creatures of Khaz Algar.",
    "CompletionText": "Come back only when you've proven yourself worthy.",
    "RewardText": "Hm. Clearance granted.\n\nThis armor is generally reserved for Stormriders. But for your valor, I give you special clearance. Wear it with pride.",
