Harbinger Crests to upgrade powerful adventuring gear. Much like Valorstones, these Crests are rewarded through many different activities. Harbinger Crests have four tiers, and more dangerous tasks reward you with higher-tier crests.\n\nBring me fifteen Weathered Harbinger Crests, and we can help you upgrade some gear further.",
