    "Description": "Dornogal! A fascinating new place to everyone--not just the dracthyr!\n\nAnd fascinating new places have fascinating new reagents to find and study. Like Valorstones!\n\nI've seen similar objects all over Azeroth used to upgrade weapons and armor. I hypothesize these will work the same way.\n\nHelp my research by bringing me any Valorstones you collect. I'll upgrade a piece of your gear in return!",
