    "Description": "Let me tell you about an opportunity.\n\nThe proto-drakes and proto-dragons have an amazing range of motion on their wings. And the ribbing! It is so extendable. We mostly make our kites from stretched hides. With the proto-drakes causing havoc, I was wondering if you could return some of their wings to me? I can make kites that would be the envy of the tribe.",
