Thank you.\n\nThere is one more thing you should know as a crafter, and that's building a rapport with your clients.\n\nI filled a crafting order for a customer today. Could you talk to him for me? Try to convince him to come to me for his future crafting needs. Remind him that he needs to come to me personally if he wants high-quality goods.",
