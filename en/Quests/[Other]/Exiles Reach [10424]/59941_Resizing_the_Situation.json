I got, at best, a passing understandin' of how this thing works.\n\nThat means I'm gonna be pushing a lot of buttons to see what happens.\n\nI'm sure we'll figure out how to upsize one of these boars. Then we'll use it to trample those undead goons!\n\nYou hold the Re-Sizer while I fiddle with it. Then just press the button and, uh... hope for the best?",
