    "Description": "By now, most hunters would have been trained in the art of trapping. Allow me to get you up to speed.\n\nWe'll start with a freezing trap. In order to make one, you'll have to forage materials from your surroundings.\n\nMeredy can provide you with a mote of ice. Scavenge the area for the rest of what is required.\n\nAnd don't delay. You will need that freezing trap to deal with a problem that has cropped up within the camp.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Scavenge parts in the area to create a Freezing Trap.",
    "CompletionText": "Did you get the supplies needed? Meredy should have the ice mote, while the other two should be nearby.",
    "RewardText": "With a little work, this can become a trap you can use. \n\nPart of being a hunter means making use of what your surroundings provide.",
