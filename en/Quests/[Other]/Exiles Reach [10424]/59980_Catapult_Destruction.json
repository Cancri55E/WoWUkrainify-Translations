    "Description": "Did you see the catapults lined up on the way over here?\n\nSeems like the ogres are planning to hurl who knows what at our camp. Good thing I came prepared!\n\nCork gave me some of his explosives as a contingency plan.\n\nI was going to save them for some enemies back in Orgrimmar... but I suppose you should use them here instead.\n\nBlow up the catapults before they fire on our camp!",
    "ObjectivesText": "Blow up 4 catapults within Darkmaul Citadel.",
    "RewardText": "Good work! You didn't happen to save any of those explosives, did you?\n\n...I didn't think so. Oh well! I have plenty of other ways to blow up my enemies.",
