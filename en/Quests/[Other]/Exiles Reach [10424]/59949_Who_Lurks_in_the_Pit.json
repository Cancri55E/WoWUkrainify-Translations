I've got the best hearing around, ever since I got this new ear sewn onto me.\n\nIt sounds like there are some more of our soldiers trapped down there. Probably all webbed up.\n\nWon'sa and I will... stay up here and help anyone who gets out.\n\nYou should jump in and rescue anyone who is left down there!",
