It was with the Alliance's assistance that Lordaeron was cleansed and the favor has now been returned.\n\nI do not think I can hope for peace. Instead, I will hope that these efforts have led to at least an understanding of the plights of both Gilneans and the Forsaken.\n\nLet us meet with Lilian in Pyrewood Village. This celebration is not for us.",
