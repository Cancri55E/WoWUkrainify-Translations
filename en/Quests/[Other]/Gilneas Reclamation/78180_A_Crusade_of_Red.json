There's a secret tunnel that will give us access to the south. From there, we can open the south gate and let our forces in while the Scarlets are distracted with Calia's troops.\n\nThere's a group of Scarlet Crusade currently skulking about the entrance to that secret tunnel. Care to take them out?",
