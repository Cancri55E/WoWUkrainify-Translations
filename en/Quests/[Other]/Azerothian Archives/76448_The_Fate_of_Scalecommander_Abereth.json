    "Description": "According to our colleagues, this cave was used to test prospective scalecommanders.\n\nExcuse me. It either tested them or housed their remains. The trials were so difficult that it usually amounted to the same thing.\n\nWe're searching for an ancient scalecommander referenced in our records as \"The Cleaving Blade\": a promising young dracthyr whose future ended abruptly somewhere near this cave. Perhaps we'll discover how their story ends.",
