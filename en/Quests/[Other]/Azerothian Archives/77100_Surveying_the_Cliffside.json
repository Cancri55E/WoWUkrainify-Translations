    "Description": "Nothing like brisk ocean air to get you in the mood to dig!\n\nWe're standing in the rubble of an ancient dragonkin fishing village. These dragonkin were ancestors of the blue dragonkin that live on the island today. Humble as it is, the remote location means it's gone relatively undisturbed by treasure hunters.\n\nIf there's anything left that hasn't fallen into the sea, we'll find it!",
