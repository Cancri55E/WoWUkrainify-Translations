    "Title": "Curious Find: Waterlogged Ledger",
    "Description": "<This leather-bound ledger is so waterlogged it's nearly falling apart.\n\nMost of it is illegible, but the text that has survived is in an ancient draconic dialect. It appears to be lists and lists of ordinary items, with numbers assigned to them-- perhaps a household accounting book?\n\nEadweard would know how to preserve this find and figure out whom it might belong to.>",
