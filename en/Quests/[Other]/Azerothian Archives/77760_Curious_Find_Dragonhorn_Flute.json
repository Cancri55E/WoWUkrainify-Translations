    "Title": "Curious Find: Dragonhorn Flute",
    "Description": "<This flute is inexpertly hewn out of the horn of a dragon. The cracking around the base suggests the dragon was long gone by the time the flute was made.\n\nThe mouthpiece is strange. It's almost like it isn't designed to be played with the mouth at all but the nose. Could this flute have been crafted by the niffen?\n\nEadweard would know how to preserve this find and figure out whom it might belong to.>",
