    "Description": "We've got a find on our hands! Looks like this might be one of my books from undergrad. Hah!\n\nNow, your job is to get all that dirt off of it, but you have to be careful. The artifacts we handle are very fragile, and the only thing worse than them staying in the ground is them breaking on the way out.\n\nEmpowering your elemental will only get you halfway. You'll need to use your environment to keep things in balance so that it's safe to excavate.",
