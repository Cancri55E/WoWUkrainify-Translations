    "Description": "Reese here is hungry as a dragon-horse for clues. Clues of the past!\n\nMore specifically, we're going to use my unique brand of magic to unveil and analyze energy that resonates with the same frequency as our relic. \n\nYou will guide Reese to these \"clues,\" where I will use him as a remote conduit to absorb those energies. \n\nWhen we've reached our critter's capacity to hold those energies, I'll port him back here to transmute it all into cold, hard data.\n\n<Reese winks at you. How strange...>",
