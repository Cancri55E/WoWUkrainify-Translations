    "Description": "Get a load of those rock formations! Surveying doesn't get much better than this.\n\nThis tower has been here for ages. The black dragonflight used it for some seriously dark stuff, but that's not why we're here. After the dragons left, a troupe of niffen bandits took shelter in the ruins and robbed the place blind. But they left a bunch of trash everywhere.\n\nImagine what we could learn about the niffen from that trash once we get digging!",
