    "Description": "\"Ascension\" is no true evolution. It is defilement. It is doom. And Ansurek further etches that doom in stone with each passing day.\n\nIf we bring down the Transformatory, then we can potentially rid Azj-Kahet of these abominations for good.\n\nIzo the Grand Splicer is Ansurek's chosen overseer of the Ascension process. Cut that wretch's head from her body, and perhaps these mutations will cease.",
