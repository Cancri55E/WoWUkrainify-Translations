    "Description": "I understand that the Algeth'ar Academy is open to the world once more. \n\nLong ago, its sacred halls were only open to dragons, but in the years that have passed the Headteacher has seen the wisdom of welcoming any who wish to learn. She has asked for my recommendation on any promising new students. \n\nAs a great ally to dragonkind, it would be an honor to have you attend our great academy. I leave the decision to enroll up to you, but I am sure Doragosa would love to at least give you a tour.",
