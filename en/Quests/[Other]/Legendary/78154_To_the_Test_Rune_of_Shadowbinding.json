    "Description": "We need to finalize the binding. We can attune the components properly by testing them in combat against Fyrakk's most powerful lieutenants. Then we can bind the attuned materials to Fyr'alath.\n\nIf you can defeat Gnarlroot, Igira the Cruel, and Volcoross while this rune is bound to them, you'll be ready to fully attune the Rune of Shadowbinding.",
