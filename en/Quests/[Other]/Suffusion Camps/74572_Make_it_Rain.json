We must act before these small sparks grow into a raging wildfire.\n\nA deep pool of fresh water can be found not far from here. Skim the surface on your drake to collect as much as you can carry, then fly over the djaradin camp to douse any flames beneath you.\n\nThis won't be enough to put out the larger blazes, but it will buy us time.",
