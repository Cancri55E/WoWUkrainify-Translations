    "Description": "I am very curious about Haleh--she is one of the last living consorts of Malygos. I am grateful for her going to Malygos in his time of need.\n\nI will admit, I have spent some time spying on her. She is a blue dragon through and through. Studious, proud, and one of the more careful ones around magic. \n\nI do feel most suited to be the one to visit her about the call of the Isles. Take my portal when you are ready. I shall meet you there.",
