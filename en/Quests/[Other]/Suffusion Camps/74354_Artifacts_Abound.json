    "Description": "It is... certainly bizarre to see Sindragosa, real in all but the flesh.\n\nLook, I appreciate that you have both come all this way for me. The Isles sounds delightful, but I have dedicated many years to cleaning up Winterspring. I am not about to leave a job unfinished. Magic is abound and unfortunately not all good.\n\nIf you would like to help, The Hidden Grove is next on my list. Therein lie ruins of totems that still emanate with some sort of magic. Will you collect pieces of them?",
