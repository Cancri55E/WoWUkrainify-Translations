    "Description": "It brightens my heart to see everyone reunited, and Malygos and Sindragosa at peace at long last. \n\nIt is time that I give you all one last gift, something the blue dragons have not seen in quite some time.\n\nThe peaceful passing of one of their own.\n\nIt is my time, $n. I should have flown beyond some time ago, but I could not leave with my kin still in disarray. \n\nWould you do an old dragon the honor of seeing me off on one last adventure?",
