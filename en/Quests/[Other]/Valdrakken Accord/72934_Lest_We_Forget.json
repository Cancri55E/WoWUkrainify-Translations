    "Description": "We will be joined shortly by Kalecgos and Alexstrasza. Before then, I have a request.\n\nThere was a tradition to have gravestones set before your death. It allowed you to choose where you would rest when you passed.\n\nIt was the job of the caretakers to update the gravestones and deposit the lingering essence of arcana at the site.\n\nBefore our guests join us, would you help me in this task? \n\nTake this list, and these graves. Update the existing graves and place the new ones.",
