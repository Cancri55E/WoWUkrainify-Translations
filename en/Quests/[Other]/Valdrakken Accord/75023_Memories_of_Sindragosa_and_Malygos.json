    "Description": "I admit, I forgot about this phenomenon. Blue dragons who meet violent ends occasionally have some lingering arcane energy.\n\nThat energy may manifest in various ways once their essences are laid to rest. \n\nLuckily, it is a simple enough process to dispel them. Simply wave anything through the energy and it will dissipate. \n\nI shall investigate the essences of Sindragosa and Malygos within this gravestone while you handle that.",
