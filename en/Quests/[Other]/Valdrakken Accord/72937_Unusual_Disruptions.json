    "Description": "Of course I can help track down the missing blue dragons. However, I have a mess on my hands that must be addressed first.\n\nMoments ago, several bursts of arcane energy swept through the Nexus, followed by attacks of strange arcane creations.\n\nI can create a method of tracking down the blue dragons if you can put down the locations of this wild arcana.\n\nTake this staff--do not break it--and use it on three locations within the Nexus. Oh, and prepare yourself for a fight.",
