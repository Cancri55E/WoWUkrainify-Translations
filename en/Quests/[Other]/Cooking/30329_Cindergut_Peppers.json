    "Description": "A certain few pandaren around here prefer their dishes unbearably spicy. Unfortunately, my access to such peppers is limited.\n\nThe Kunzen hozen, in the mountains to the west, often carry cindergut peppers. A few of those and I'll be set for a few days.\n\nSay, could you collect some for me? You might want to wear gloves if you'll be handling them directly.",
