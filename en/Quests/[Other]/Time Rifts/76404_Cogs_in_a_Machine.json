    "Description": "<This cog spiraled out of a mechanized creature as you sent it back to its timeway.\n\nWhile its design is similar to Mechagnome technology, it's sleeker and more refined.\n\nIt bears a small inscription.\n\nSoridormi will want to see this.>",
    "ObjectivesText": "After completing a Time Rift, return to Soridormi in the Tyrhold Reservoir.",
    "ObjectivesCompletionText": "Return the item to Soridormi in the Tyrhold Reservoir.",
    "RewardText": "<Soridormi reads the inscription on the cog.>\n\n\"Mechanization is the only way to true peace\".\n\nAn interesting sentiment, but also a lie. This timeway clearly continued to develop weapons for war.\n\nI can't help but wonder: if they weren't fighting each other, what were they fighting?\n\nI'll put this on the tables if you want to look at it later.",
