Now all kinds of fantastic creatures are swarming into Azeroth.\n\nThank goodness for Soridormi. I heard she's getting everyone organized to make a stand. If you can offer any assistance, I'm sure she could use it.\n\nThey say she's still stationed in Tyrhold Reservoir. Do it for Valdrakken. Do it for Azeroth!",
