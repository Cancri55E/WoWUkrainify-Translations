    "Description": "<This book has what appears to be a modified Horde symbol on it. You recognize it as the Blood Horde symbol you have seen from timeway incursions.\n\nIt is odd it is still here, after the incursion has ended. \n\nThe book has been soaked in blood, though it has long since dried off.\n\nSoridormi might be interested in this.>",
    "ObjectivesText": "After completing a Time Rift, return to Soridormi in the Tyrhold Reservoir.",
    "RewardText": "<Soridormi flips through the book after you hand it to her.>\n\nOur world has been at war for such a long time against one aggressor or another. \n\nSo has theirs, but they just fight each other, over and over again.\n\nIt would be easy to judge them, but our worlds are both drowned in blood.\n\n<Soridormi looks pensive.>\n\nI will put the book on the table in case you want to read it.",
