    "Description": "We're on a roll! We picked up an even more anomalous anomaly while you were out and tracked it down to just east of town.\n\nWe've got a brand-new Transpositional Signal Recombobulatron already set up out there, but I didn't want to start without you. You've been a big help, after all.\n\nAll you have to do is dial it in and throw the switch! Easy as pie, which I'm told is very easy.\n\nRivet says that the odds of something cataclysmic happening are pretty good, so I know nothing bad can happen!",
