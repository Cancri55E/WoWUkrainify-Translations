And when I'm not fishing, I craft fishing gear!\n\nIf I've learned anything from my many years fishing, it's that you also have to have a little fun out there--change things up, think outside the net!\n\nHere's some gear I dreamed up to help you new fishers along! You can have one for free, but if you'd like both, I'll gladly trade you for the other.",
