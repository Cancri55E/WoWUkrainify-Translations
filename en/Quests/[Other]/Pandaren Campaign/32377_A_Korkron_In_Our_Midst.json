I wouldn't be surprised if he tore Kun-Lai Summit apart to find that artifact.\n\nThe Warchief's called a gathering at Garrosh'ar Advance, just to our north.\n\nI need to stay here to monitor troop movements, so you'll have to infiltrate their camp and overhear their discussion.\n\nGo to Garrosh'ar Advance and steal some Kor'kron Armor from Reavers, Honor Guards, and Scouts.\n\nTake this radio earpiece. Don't contact me... I'll contact you.",
