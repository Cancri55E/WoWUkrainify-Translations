    "Description": "$p! Prince Anduin has somehow slipped his guards again. His control over the light is greatly increasing.\n\nHe was last seen heading to Kun-Lai Summit. He gave our mages the slip around the Valley of Emperors.\n\nCan you find him? He insists on searching for what he claims is a counter to the Divine Bell. Perhaps you can talk some sense into him before he seizes control of your mind and has you dance your way back here.\n\nTalk to Fennie for a ride into the mountains.",

    "RewardText": "I am glad you made it, my friend. I could really use your help with what is to come. My father would prefer I remain in the safe custody of his legion.\n\nBut if there is one thing Pandaria has taught me, it is a few people in the right place at the right time can make a bigger difference than the greatest of armies.",
