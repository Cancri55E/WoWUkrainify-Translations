    "Description": "Now, I could tell you who Connelly is, but that would be too easy! To catch a spy you have to think like a spy.\n\nYou have to pass the test first!\n\nThe small things can say a lot about a person. It's all in the details.\n\nI'm going to give you a drink to deliver. I will give you a small detail about something the recipient is wearing. From there it will be up to you.\n\nBe careful who you pick to give drinks to. People here tend to get pretty hostile if you give them the wrong order!",
