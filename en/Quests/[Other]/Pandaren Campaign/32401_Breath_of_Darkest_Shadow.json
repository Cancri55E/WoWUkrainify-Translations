    "RewardText": "<Anduin looks like a crumpled doll. He lays as still as a stone, and the only movement comes from the frigid air ruffling his fair, golden hair.>\n\n<You sit quietly for a while, until the cold settles into your bones. The bell is destroyed, but the silence is deafening.>\n\n<Out of the corner of your eye, you see the slightest flicker from the boy's hand. You lean in close. He breathes - but just barely! Anduin is alive!>",
