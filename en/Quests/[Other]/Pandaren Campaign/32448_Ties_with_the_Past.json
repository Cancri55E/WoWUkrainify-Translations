    "Description": "While I was in the Vale, I came across an ancient pandaren recipe for Memory Wine. I believe this brew can coax some helpful information out of Shan Kien.\n\nI am needed here, so I have no choice but to ask you to recover the essential ingredient for me. We need the spirit essence of a mogu that lived in the time of the memory we wish to see.\n\nYou should be able to find just such a spirit inside the Path of Conquerors, to the northeast.",
