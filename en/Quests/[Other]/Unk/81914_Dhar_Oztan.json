    "Description": "I love the stormrooks. Taking care of them was my directive, so they're all I've ever known. But even so, there are questions about them that even I don't have answers to.\n\nBaelgrim--Stormward Baelgrim--he was the expert. I'd pester him about them at every opportunity. And he shared what he could.\n\nHe told me once about summoning rooks at Dhar Oztan. It's an old Stormrider outpost that predates the Stormperch. If you want to know more about stormrooks, that's where we need to go.",
