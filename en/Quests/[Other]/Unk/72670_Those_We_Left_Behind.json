    "Description": "In attempting to defend their home against the fury of the blue dragonflight, Shandaral's mages condemned the souls of their people to an eternity of crystalline torment. \n\nNow their echoes wander aimlessly, reliving their civilization's doom again and again for more than ten thousand years.\n\nI have found that some of the shades yet retain a shred of sentience. Perhaps they can be reasoned with--convinced to free themselves from the mire of their own ancient fear and pass on at last.",
