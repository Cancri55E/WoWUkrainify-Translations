    "Description": "Shandaral's reckless use of the crystal focus placed too much stress on the relic, causing it to shatter. Its fragments have been scattered amidst the crystalline permafrost.\n\nI can recreate the focus, but I will need you to collect enough of those shards to give me something to go on. You should be able to find them amidst the piles of crystal refuse scattered throughout the area.\n\nTake heed, $c. Those shards may still hold fragments of the mages's memories from that fateful day.",
