    "Description": "The time is upon us, $n. With your help, most of the restless echoes of Shandaral have been quelled. However, some yet remain whose rage and sorrow burns too brightly to be eased by mere words.\n\nUsing the shards that you recovered, I have managed to recreate a facsimile of the crystal focus that brought Shandaral to ruin. Using it here should bring the anchored spirits to bear and give us an opportunity to grant them final rest.\n\nBe on guard. I do not know how their long-held sorrows will manifest.",
