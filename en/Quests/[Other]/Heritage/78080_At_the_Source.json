    "Description": "Can you hear that? The silence? \n\nThe area is empty. Not even the rabid wildlife dare approach the camp.\n\nI do not see any immediate cause, but the fel resonance here is overwhelming. I sense it was woven by man'ari hands, but I'm being blocked from probing more deeply.\n\nSomething is being hidden.\n\nIt must be the cloaking magic Hatuun reported from the other camp that hinders me. I can dispel it, but I cannot guarantee what we will find when I do.",
