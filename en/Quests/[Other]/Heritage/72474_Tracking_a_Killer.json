Orcs have been going missing, and many of our young trainees have been injured.\n\nThe peons took to calling the mysterious attacker the Long Knives because the few bodies we have found all have long, terrible gashes across their backs. They're terrified, and refusing to work!\n\nWe have no idea who or what Gor'krosh really is, but they are clearly very dangerous. Please, find this monster and end this madness!",
