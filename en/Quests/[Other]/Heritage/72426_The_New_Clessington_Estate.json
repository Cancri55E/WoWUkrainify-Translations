He has fallen on hard times since Anduin cracked down on corruption in Stormwind.\n\nI would not put it past him to have something to do with this.\n\nHe recently purchased an old manor in Duskwood. I will contact my sources and see what other information I can find. You and Vanessa should go to the manor and investigate.",
