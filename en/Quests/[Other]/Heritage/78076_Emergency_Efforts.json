He needs your assistance.\n\nThe satyr that infest a nearby island have been ambushing draenei traveling for the Tishamaat.\n\nVelen and I have been attempting to solve the problem quietly. He does not wish to mobilize the vindicators and alarm his people on a day of sacrament.\n\nBut, despite our efforts, the attacks have continued. The event may need to be canceled if we cannot get the demons under control.\n\nCome with me so we may end this threat.",
