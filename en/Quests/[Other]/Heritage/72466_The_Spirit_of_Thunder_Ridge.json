The arrival of your people and the humans was but the first link in the chain that led to desolation.\n\nYou yourself are not to blame, but you can be the force that restores what once was.\n\nDive into the waters below and recover the seeds buried in the silt. They are a memory of the ancient forest that once grew in harmony with my people.\n\nBeware, the elements are not at peace here.",
