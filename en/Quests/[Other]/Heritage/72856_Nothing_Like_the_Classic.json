    "Description": "We of the Royal Apothecaries have synthesized many nuanced plagues in recent years, in keeping with our agreement with the Desolate Council not to... overdo it.\n\nBut when it comes to rooting out Scarlet assailants, there really is nothing like the classic. The original plague that exists -- mostly -- only in the diseased tissue of surviving descendants.\n\nGo, gather up samples from this marvelous wildlife and bring them to me. I can put them to greater use.",
