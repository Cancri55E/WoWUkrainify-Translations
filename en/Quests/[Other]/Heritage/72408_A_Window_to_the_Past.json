    "Description": "In this, I trust Vanessa's word. I do not believe she knows what the Drakefire Amulet is. Some of the story about Onyxia was made public, but not all.\n\nPerhaps even you do not know. \n\nI will explain everything, for both of you.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak with Shaw under the Lion's Pride Inn in Goldshire to hear about the history of the Drakefire Amulet.",
    "CompletionText": "<Vanessa sizes you up.>",
    "RewardText": "We all have our own versions of the past, don't we? \n\nI don't care if some dragon lady had a magic amulet. It wasn't complete mind control. \n\nThe nobles already hated the common people. The Stonemason's Guild would never have needed to turn to banditry and become the Defias Brotherhood, if not for them.",
