    "Description": "I cannot in good conscience gather the draenei for the Tishamaat if we are threatened this close to home.\n\nIf one of the man'ari is using the satyr to orchestrate these attacks, or to distract us from some larger foul purpose, then they must be rooted out immediately.\n\nWe will divide our efforts to look for signs of the enemy. Arzaal will search the northern satyr camp. You, Hatuun, and myself will search the closer camp.",
