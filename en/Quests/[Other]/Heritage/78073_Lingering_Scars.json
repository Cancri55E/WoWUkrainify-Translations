    "Description": "I believe we may be able to help.\n\nBut perhaps you could aid me first...\n\nWhen we received word that the Tishamaat was upon us, we hurried to prepare our most tortured spirits for the journey to the Exodar. The celebration's sacraments may help them rest peacefully.\n\nHowever, they must consent to being moved. So, we must commune with and soothe them first.\n\nWill you help calm these spirits? Afterward, I will take you to where Hataaru is entombed and give you what you seek.",
