    "Description": "My schematics speak for themselves.\n\nEach calculation has been verified. It is respectful of all building codes. I even included a layout of the channels that the power grid must follow.\n\nRomuul knows the project. He already signed off on everything. He can explain it to the masses himself.\n\nI do not need to waste my valuable time traveling to the Exodar for this ridiculous holiday.\n\nMy apprentice will give you the schematics on a data crystal. Take it and leave.",
