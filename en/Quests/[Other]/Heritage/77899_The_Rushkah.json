    "Description": "When we make de rush'kah, we recreate de shape of the loa as we be seein' dem in our mind. By knowing the shape of de loa, we better understand who dey are. But de mask be shaped by our hands, so when de loa sees it, dey know what we expect dem to be. \n\nIf the loa don't bless the mask, we expect dem to be something dey will not be. If de loa bless de mask, dey like what we see in dem and a bargain can be struck. \n\nWe could just write a contract, but it is easier to lie with words than with your hands.",
