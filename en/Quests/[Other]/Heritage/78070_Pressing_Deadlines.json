    "Description": "During this Tishamaat, Ataanya and I will present our project's schematics.\n\nAtaanya is High Artificer of Shattrath. Her father was my late mentor, the famed Exarch Hataaru.\n\nHataaru's hoofplates are hard to fill, but Ataanya has more than done so.\n\nShe has the schematics, and she should be here when they are presented. But she is not responding to my messages.\n\nAtaanya seldom leaves the city, but surely she can make an exception for the Tishamaat. Perhaps you can reason with her.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Speak to Ataanya in Shattrath City.",
    "RewardText": "I have a data crystal prepared. The schematics are on it.\n\nMy apprentice can find it for you.\n\nI have no time to leave Shattrath.",
