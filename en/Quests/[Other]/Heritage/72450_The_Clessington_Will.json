    "Description": "I'm no great mage like my father, but I do know a few of his tricks. \n\nI saw those signets you got off the enforcers. My father's private chambers were locked by a similar magical trinket, which can be broken apart into pieces. \n\nLet me put those signets back together into an arcane key. That should get us past the barrier.\n\nThen... I can only hope we can talk some sense into him.",
