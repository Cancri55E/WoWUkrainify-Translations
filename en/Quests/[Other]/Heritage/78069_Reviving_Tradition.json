    "Description": "The Prophet wished to personally ask for your help with the Tishamaat. But since he is working elsewhere, I asked you first to jumpstart our task.\n\nMy colleague and I have been working on a special project. And since the Prophet has declared today the Tishamaat, we will unveil it at the celebration!\n\nFor this, I need the emitter, but it needs an overhaul. We only have time for a hot wiring.\n\nGet some filament and a soldering tool from the crates nearby, $n. Then maybe I can wire it to an array.",

    "CompletionText": "I regret not having apprentices in times like this.",
    "RewardText": "<Romuul gives the newly seated crystal a test wiggle.>\n\nNot my finest work, but it will do.\n\nLight willing, it will remain functional until our project is revealed and the celebration is over.",
