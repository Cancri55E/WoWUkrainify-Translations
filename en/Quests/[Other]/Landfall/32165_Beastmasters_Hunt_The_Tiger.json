    "Description": "Along with the trap, you get some advice on tiger hunting:\n\nTigers are gluttons, and big game is hard to come by in this jungle. If you want to tempt the elder cats out of their hiding places, you need a tempting meal.\n\nJust on the other side of the Serpent's Spine, you can find a herd of yaks. Kill them, bring their meat to the jungle's edge, set up your trap, and wait.",
