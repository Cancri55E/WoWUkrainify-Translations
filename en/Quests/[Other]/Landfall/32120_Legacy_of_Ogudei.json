    "Description": "The ruins which we are occupying were built by Ogudei - an ancient mogu ruler. We know little about who he was, though the rise of the spirits in this area seems to indicate that it was related to spirit binding.\n\nWhen you destroy these spirits, a small amount of their essence will remain in this world. Bring it to us - we will analyze it and hopefully learn more about Ogudei's history - and his power.",
