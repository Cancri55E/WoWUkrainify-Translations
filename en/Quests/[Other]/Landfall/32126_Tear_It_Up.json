Their assault would be formidable, if it were directed at lesser creatures.\n\nTo sustain a siege and put pressure on our troops they are air dropping in supplies to support their ground forces.\n\nSearch the beaches and docks to the south for any airdropped supplies and smash them.\n\nLet the Alliance see their food and ammunition destroyed before their eyes and despair.",
