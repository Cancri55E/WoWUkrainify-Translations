Oh wow, a spinefish alpha, one of Pandaria's deadliest predators.\n\nSpinefish are malformed abominations created by the sha presence, and these big ones are simply terrifying.  An alpha will often eat other spinefish, even though there isn't a single part of them that's edible.\n\nLuckily for both of us, they are very interesting to alchemists.\n\n",
