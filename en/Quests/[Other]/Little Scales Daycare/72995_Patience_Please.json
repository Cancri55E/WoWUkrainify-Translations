    "Description": "Belastrasza has learned much through her vorquin foal, but I have thought of one more lesson that should be excellent for her.\n\nHer lack of patience has been stumping me for quite some time. Recently I was reflecting by the water, watching the turtles go about their day. Then I was hit by a revelation!\n\nWurallie has the perfect battle to test Belastrasza's patience, but poor Princess Vorquistrasza doesn't have the endurance. Can you meet them in the Waking Shores to lend a hand?",

    "RewardText": "She has truly come a long way since arriving at the daycare. While she still has more to learn, I am extremely proud of her.\n\nShe has expressed a desire to accompany you on your adventures. I hope she will not order you around too much.",
