    "Description": "In order for the obsidian hatchling to be comfortable, we must build them a proper nest.\n\nYou will need to build their nest from Obsidian Citadel coal to make sure it is warm and suitable. Secondly, Archivist Edress will be able to assist you in finding something that ties them to their people.\n\nWe will want to gather something from Zaralek Cavern as well, as much of their flight's history is rooted there. Surely somebody in Loamm can help.",
