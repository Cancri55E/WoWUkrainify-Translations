    "Description": "I worry about Ruszi. She is incredibly nervous and insecure, and she jumps at nearly anything! I have never heard of a black dragon so terrified of the world.\n\nI believe the best way for us to build her confidence is to find her a companion. Something sturdy and strong that does not move quickly or suddenly.\n\nThe black dragonflight's charge is the protection of earth. Perhaps a small elemental will suit her well.\n\nSpeak to Lysindra at the pet shop in Valdrakken. She should have something suitable.",
