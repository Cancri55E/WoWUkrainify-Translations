    "Description": "When I think of red dragon comfort food, I immediately think of the pies back at the Ruby Life Pools. You can always tell when our blacksmith, Krendisc, has downtime between orders--the entire mountain smells of delicious baked dragonfruit!\n\nMy pie may not be as good as his, but I am sure our ruby hatchling will love it. If you bring me the ingredients I will bake the best pie I can!",
