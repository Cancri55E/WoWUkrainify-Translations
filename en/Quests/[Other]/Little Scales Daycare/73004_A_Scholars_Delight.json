    "Description": "Blue dragons are seekers of knowledge, even from an early age. They seem drawn to books and scrolls, finding the most comfort when surrounded by them.\n\nFor our azure hatchling, the best nest is truly amongst our many books. I request that you collect the following for his nest--a quill of his own to learn to write, something to keep him nice and cold, and a bedtime story from Azure Span. I have heard tale of one that many blue dragons remember fondly.",
    "ObjectivesText": "Gather supplies for the Azure Hatchling's nest. \n\nAwakened Frost can be collected from many elementals across the Dragon Isles, created by combining 10 Rousing Frost, or bought from the auction house.",
