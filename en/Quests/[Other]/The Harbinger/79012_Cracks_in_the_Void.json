    "Description": "Telogrus Rift has always been extremely sensitive to cosmic shifts. It makes for a rather precarious homestead, but the void elves have... few options available to us.\n\nThe recent influx in void energies has resulted in unstable rifts opening sporadically. And with so many investigating Azeroth, I'm having trouble finding Riftwalkers to deal with them.\n\nCould you close any unstable void rifts you find along your path?",
