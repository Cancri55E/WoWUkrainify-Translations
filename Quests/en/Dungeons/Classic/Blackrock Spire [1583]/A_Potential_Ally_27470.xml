  <Title>A Potential Ally</Title>
  <Description>It is no secret that we aren't fans of the orcs in Blackrock Mountain, but we do carefully watch their every move. Nothing happens in that Mountain without me knowing about it, $c.$B$BRecently, a different sort of orc came into Blackrock. He resides just inside Blackrock Spire, and I know he's somehow planning to overthrow Nefarian and his whole army of orcs. Normally I wouldn't trust their kind, but we share a common goal for the time being. Find him, he's called Acride.</Description>
