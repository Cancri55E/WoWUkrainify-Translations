  <Title>Blackhand's Command</Title>
  <Description>Imbecile,$B$BI hold very little faith in your ability to prevent outsiders from accessing the master's lair. In the very likely event of your death, this orb has its own failsafe built in to prevent outsiders from teleporting directly into Blackwing.$B$BOnly those with the Mark of Drakkisath branded upon their hand may make use of this orb. Thankfully, Drakkisath is not nearly as incompetent as you, Quartermaster. He guards the brand himself!$B$B-Warchief Rend Blackhand$B$BP.S. Destroy this letter, idiot.</Description>
  <LogDescription>That is one stupid orc. It would appear as if you need to find this brand and gain the Mark of Drakkisath in order to access the Orb of Command.$B$BThe letter indicates that General Drakkisath guards the brand. Perhaps you should investigate.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You don't even flinch as the smoldering brand is pressed into your flesh. You are so tough!$B$BYou now hold the Mark of Drakkisath. Have fun storming the castle.</RewardText>
