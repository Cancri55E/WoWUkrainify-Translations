  <Title>Servants of Theradras</Title>
  <Description>Princess Theradras, my former mate, has used her enormous power to corrupt the very nature of Maraudon. Even now her creations run rampant here, and I fear that they may soon escape into the open world to sow the seeds of death and destruction.$B$B$n, venture forth and kill Noxxion and Razorlash. They are two of her most powerful minions and their deaths would cause the callous Princess much deserved grief and suffering of her own. Then, perhaps, you can help free my spirit from her grasp.</Description>

  <RewardText>Without her powerful servants, Princess Theradras is significantly more vulnerable. Find her lair, $n...it is time to strike.$B$B&lt;You feel a sizable lump of gold appear in your bags, clearly a reward for your work here.&gt;</RewardText>
