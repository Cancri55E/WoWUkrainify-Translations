  <Description>First things first; let's kill us some crusaders.$B$BAnd when I say kill the Scarlet Crusade, I mean wipe them out, root and branch, rank and file.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 50 members of the Scarlet Crusade within the Scarlet Halls.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You know, I've been killing the ones that you can't see behind closed doors.$B$BBut I need to maintain this disguise. So if you could just take care of all of the ones out there in the open, that'd be great.</CompletionText>
