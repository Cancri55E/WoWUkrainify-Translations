  <Title>Blades of the Anointed</Title>
  <Description>The problem with the Scarlet Crusade is that they keep coming back, even after death.$B$BBehind those resurrections is High Inquisitor Whitemane. With her death, so goes the Crusade.$B$BTo give her the final rest, we need two swords of legend, each with a lost but storied history.$B$BLuckily for me... er, us, these two blades of the anointed are at rest here within the monastery.$B$BFind them and once you've killed Whitemane, plunge the blades into her corpse to make the death permanent.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect the two Blades of the Anointed.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;With one blade already in your possession, you move to take the other.&gt;$B$B&lt;An inscription on the statue behind the sword reads, "The Hand of Providence".&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The second anointed blade floats just in front of the wet statue. Steam rises from the sword.&gt;$B$B&lt;You get the uncanny feeling that the Hand of Providence has been waiting for you.&gt;</RewardText>
