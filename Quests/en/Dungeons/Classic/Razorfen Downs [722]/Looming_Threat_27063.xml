  <Title>Looming Threat</Title>
  <Description>The Scourge are a direct affront to nature. They have managed to corrupt the Quilboar in Razorfen Downs and now threaten to spread further into Thousand Needles and eventually, I fear, west into Feralas. You must go there and do anything you can to confine them. Perhaps you can find someone in the area to help you? The winds whisper of a powerful presence in the area.</Description>
