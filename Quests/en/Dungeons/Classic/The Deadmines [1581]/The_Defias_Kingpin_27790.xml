  <Title>The Defias Kingpin</Title>
  <Description>Hello there, $n. I've heard a great deal about you. Listen closely, you're only going to have one solid shot at this.$B$BThe new Defias Kingpin must be inside the hut orchestrating this entire operation. I want you to go inside and take her down, for the sake of the hundreds of innocent people the organization her father started has killed and terrorized.$B$BI'm shocked that she would let you get so close to her domain without fleeing and waiting until more favorable conditions, but it seems we're in luck.</Description>
