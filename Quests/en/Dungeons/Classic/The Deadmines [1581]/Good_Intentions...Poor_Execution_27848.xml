  <Title>Good Intentions...Poor Execution</Title>
  <Description>The Defias plan to finish their Juggernaut and use it to lay waste to Stormwind. It is a noble cause any true orc warrior would embrace without a single thought!$B$BVanessa's fault lies in her execution of their plan. The ship is poorly constructed, the crew practically untrained, and, worst of all, there's a worgen in their midst!$B$BHis name is Admiral Ripsnarl, and he must be mercilessly slain in the name of the Warchief. Lok'tar ogar!</Description>
