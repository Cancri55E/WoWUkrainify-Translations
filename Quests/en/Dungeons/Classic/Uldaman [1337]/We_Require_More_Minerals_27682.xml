  <Title>We Require More Minerals</Title>
  <Description>The Titans built two Ancient Stone Keepers to help protect Uldaman from would-be invaders and to oversee daily operations while Ironaya and Archaedas slumber. One is still fully operational in Temple Hall, but the one in Echomok Cavern has been corrupted by something.$B$BI suspect that one of the Old Gods is responsible for this, and you're going to help me see if that is indeed true. Topple both of the guardians and bring me their power cores. They'll tell us all we need to know. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Obsidian Power Core and the Titan Power Core.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the cores with you, or are you just here to chat? Perhaps we should stop this whole charade and enjoy some snacks and fine wine instead?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Both of these cores are still far more potent than most of the cores we use  to power our own protectors, and these are ancient devices!$B$BThank you, these will prove extremely valuable to our society.</RewardText>
