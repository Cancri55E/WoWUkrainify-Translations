  <Title>Plague...Plague Everywhere!</Title>
  <Description>The best part about this plague is that even when it visually fades away, the remaining residue is still quite potent! However, we still have an enormous area to cover before we're done, with plenty of Godfrey's defenses in the way.$B$BIt appears that the spirits that served Baron Silverlaine and Commander Springvale in life now guard them in death, and Godfrey is using them to deter us. Show them all the iron will of the Forsaken!</Description>

  <CompletionText>A couple bodiless spirits aren't going to best you, are they?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Cromush has both a thick skull and a fool's brain, and we'll use that to our advantage. By the time anybody finds out about the plague's true potency, it'll be far too late.$B$BThank you for keeping quiet during his tirade. I promise you won't regret it.</RewardText>
