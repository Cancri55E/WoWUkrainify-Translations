  <Title>Sniffing Them Out</Title>
  <Description>I could smell Godfrey and his companions a mile away from here. They did an exceedingly poor job covering their tracks in flight. It will be the mistake that puts the final nail in their coffins.$B$BOne of them is very close, and though the scent has changed slightly in undeath, I'm fairly certain it's Ashbury's. Go inside and tear him to pieces, we'll ensure the Forsaken do not intervene with our task.</Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>Baron Ashbury</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>He's near.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Kill Baron Ashbury.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The scent of freshly spilled traitor blood fills my nostrils, and it is absolutely invigorating. However, my bloodlust will not be sated until Godfrey lies on the floor as a lifeless heap.$B$BHe thinks an army of mindless corpses can stop the wrath of the Bloodfang? We'll gnaw on their bones for years to come after our work is done!</RewardText>
