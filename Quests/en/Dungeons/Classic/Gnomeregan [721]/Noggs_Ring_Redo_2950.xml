  <Title>Nogg's Ring Redo</Title>
  <Description>No, no, no - I'm not all of the sudden saying that the ring is mine.  I normally don't do this, but your information about the Dark Irons was very useful.  I'll improve your ring for you, better than whomever made this simple little thing could have ever done.  Probably some gnome...$B$BIf you bring me a bar of silver, a moss agate, and thirty silver coins for my trouble, I'll add a silver and agate lattice to the ring that will strengthen the magic inside of it.  Interested?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Brilliant Gold Ring, a Silver Bar, a Moss Agate, and 30 silver coins to Nogg in Orgrimmar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the materials I need?  I can't improve on this design without everything I asked for.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Here's your ring, better than before.  Thanks again for the information about those Dark Iron dwarves.  This seems like a reasonable lead as to how those gnomes suddenly were struck with goblin-like inspiration.</RewardText>
