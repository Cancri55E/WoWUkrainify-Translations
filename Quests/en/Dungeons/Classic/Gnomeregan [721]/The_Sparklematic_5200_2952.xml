  <Title>The Sparklematic 5200!</Title>
  <Description />
  <RewardText>As quickly as it started, the Sparklematic 5200 comes to an abrupt halt. A simple "ding" is heard from the machine, and the mouth of the machine spirals upward. Inside the Sparklematic 5200 is a small box wrapped in a little bow. The machine would appear to wrap an object up after eliminating its grime-encrusted status. Even if the machine didn't work, at least the item is now wrapped in a pretty box.$B$BWell, there is one way to find out if it cleaned the item or not...</RewardText>
