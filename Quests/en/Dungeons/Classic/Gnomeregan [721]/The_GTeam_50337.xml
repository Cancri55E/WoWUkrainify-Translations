  <Description>That Murd Doc is crazy, $c. Never, ever, let you find yourself in an aircraft with that gnome.

Stealth usually isn't my thing, and it's certainly not going to be yours. Go down this hallway to the Launch Bay and dispose of the Electrocutioner 6000.

The Electrocutioner is in charge of the aircraft...

...and I hate aircraft. I'm not getting in any sort of aircraft!

Use this parachute to drop down afterwards and speak with Commando Face for your next job.</Description>
