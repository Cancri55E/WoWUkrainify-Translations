  <Title>Return of the Ring</Title>
  <Description>Opening the box produced by the Sparklematic 5200 reveals what you had suspected - a shiny ring!  Wearing the ring, you feel magic power surge through you body.$B$BInside the band is a small but nonetheless discernable imprint of the seal of Ironforge.  Next to that, three small initials are engraved: "TdK".  This may signify either the initials of the previous owner, or perhaps the initials of the ring's crafter.  Keep the ring... or return it to this person.  Decisions, decisions...</Description>

  <RewardText>A ring, you say?  Let's see... yep, I made that ring by golly.$B$BBefore Gnomeregan went up, I had a small shop there.  Perhaps it's one I left behind when I ran for the hills; it's a simple design, and I made several like it.  Maybe it's from someone who didn't make it out.$B$BDark Iron dwarves had this?  Well, that puts a new layer of conspiracy on the nine different layers already floating about.  Maybe the authorities would like to know; it's wasted on the likes of me.$B$BNow, back to the ring...</RewardText>
