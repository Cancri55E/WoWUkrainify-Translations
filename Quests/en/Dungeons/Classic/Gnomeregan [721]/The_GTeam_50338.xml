  <Title>The G-Team</Title>
  <Description>How did you get in here, $n?

I'm Murd Doc of the G-Team and we could use the help of a $r like you.

Help us defeat the irradiated inhabatants that now call Gnomeregan home, and I'll make you an honorary G-Team Commando!

Take this parachute, jump down into the Hall of Gears, and take out the Viscous Fallout. After you're done, report to Commando B.E Barechus by the west hallway. You two will get along great, I'm sure.</Description>
