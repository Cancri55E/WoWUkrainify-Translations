  <Title>Grime-Encrusted Ring</Title>
  <Description>You have uncovered what appears to be a ring from the corpse of one of the Dark Iron dwarves.  It is difficult to tell what kind of ring it is, however; dirt and hardened residue cake the item completely, making wearing it impossible.  You think you can make out the slight luster of precious metal and maybe even the glint of a gem under the residue.$B$BIf you are going to make use of this ring, you are going to need to find something to get the hardened residue off of it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Figure out a way to remove the grime from the Grime-Encrusted Ring.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The gnomish contraption before you bears a plaque calling it "The Sparklematic 5200".  The gist of the machine, from reading the instructions below the plaque, is to scrub away dirt that an item might have.  The machine has a coin slot, accepting three silver coins to start the process once the item is placed inside it.$B$BIt would seem as though the grime-encrusted ring you found earlier is just the thing to try in this machine!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You place the ring inside the Sparklematic 5200 and deposit a silver coin into the slot.$B$BPainful grinding noises emanate from the machine as it begins to jerk around violently.  One can only guess what is happening with the ring inside the machine...$B$BThe machine suddenly stops, trumpeting its cessation with a simple "Ding!"  The item receptacle opens up to reveal a small box that is neatly wrapped with a red bow.  It would appear that the Sparklematic 5200 also gift wraps!</RewardText>
