  <Title>The Heart of the Temple</Title>
  <Description>I must confess I have a more personal involvement in this affair. One of the first of the green dragons corrupted here was my brother, Eranikus.$B$BI thought Eranikus gone, lost forever to the darkest rifts of nightmare, but I have heard that his shade has emerged within the temple. I know not whether it is truly him, or an empty, mournful echo.$B$BIf you wish to help me further, return to the Hall of Masks and journey through the archway into the true sanctum of the temple. I will find you there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Lord Itharius again inside the Temple of Atal'Hakkar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I am pleased to see you once again, $n. You are truly noble to assist me further.</RewardText>
