  <Title>The Blood God Hakkar</Title>
  <Description>Hakkar... The mere mention of The Soulflayer's name will send many running. In the Sanctum of the Fallen God the Atal'ai have recovered a significant portion of his skeleton and seek to restore him to life. Already his children have begun to show up in the area.$B$BPlace this egg in that sanctum, and it will force his summoning prematurely. $n, do not hesitate. Strike once his avatar appears!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill the Avatar of Hakkar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You have successfully stopped Hakkar here, but I fear we are far from done. The Atal'ai transported most of the blood they produced to Zul'Gurub, where the Hakkari work to summon The Blood God there.$B$B$n, I do not think that this was ever meant to be the place of Hakkar's arrival - it was merely a test to see if the blood was potent enough! Hakkar can only be summoned in Zul'Gurub...and I fear we may be too late to stop the Hakkari with the blood they now have in their possession.</RewardText>
