  <Title>Blackfathom Deeps</Title>
  <Description>I care deeply about these forests, $c. Things look grim here, but I would rather face the Horde alone than watch them hack and slash their way through the trees.$B$BTravel west to Blackfathom Deeps. Once you're inside, find Sentinel Aluwyn. She's a trusted friend in need of help.$B$BThe orcs in Zoram'gar Outpost threaten her position as we speak. If they take Blackfathom, they will surely cut every tree down to fuel their insanity.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Sentinel Aluwyn.</LogDescription>
