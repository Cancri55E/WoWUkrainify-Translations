  <Title>A Broken Trap</Title>
  <Description />
  <RewardText>A large, broken trap lies before you.  From the looks of it, the ogres have tried to repair the trap but to no avail.$B$BA hastily written note lies next to the trap, and strangely enough it details exactly how to repair it: just a few simple adjustments ought to do it.  Were the trap repaired, an ogre passing near it might get trapped, and could be avoided.$B$BClearly, it would seem fortuitous that very few ogres know how to read.$B$BClearly.</RewardText>
