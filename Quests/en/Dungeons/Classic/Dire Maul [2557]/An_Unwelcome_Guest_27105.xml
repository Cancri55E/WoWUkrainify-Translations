  <Title>An Unwelcome Guest</Title>
  <Description>You will find that Dire Maul is filled with many nature and arcane elementals. Somehow, a water elemental has found its way into this area. Please gather its essence and take it to me. I am curious as to how one of their kind got here, and what sort of agenda it may have against the natural elements of Eldre'Thalas.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect the Hydrospawn Essence.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you carry the essence, or did the task prove too difficult?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It is very troublesome that a water elemental was here, let alone one that powerful. Take this as my thanks for your efforts. I must examine this essence for any knowledge it may contain.</RewardText>
