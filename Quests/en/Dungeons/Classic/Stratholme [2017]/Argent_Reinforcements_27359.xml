  <Title>Argent Reinforcements</Title>
  <Description>The Scourge have some sort of ward in place that's preventing me from opening a portal so that our reinforcements can help us take the city! It's like a neverending screaming inside of my head! Agh!$B$BI'm doing all I can to retain my sanity from that noise with this barrier. My best guess is that the banshees are maintaining the defense. If you could bring me some of their essences, I think I can use them to counteract the ward and get our boys in here!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 4 Banshee Essences.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to obtain the essences? Be careful, they're deadly spellcasters.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Oh my... the banshees are very tortured souls indeed. Merely holding their essence is emotionally painful...$B$BEnough of that for now. I'll get to work on counteracting their magic, then we'll have a portal up and running in no time. Stratholme will be ours soon, I just know it.</RewardText>
