  <Title>Rebirth of the K.E.F.</Title>
  <Description>Emperor Dagran Thaurissan has total control over the city from his throne ahead. If we are to stop his armies, we're going to have to end their emperor's reign.$B$BYou'll need to get past his personal guard, including the giant Magmus, to reach him. Move as quickly as possible - if word gets out before you finish, the entire city will descend upon his throne.$B$BNote that the doors across the Lyceum will only open once you've lit the braziers with torches from the flamekeepers. Good luck.</Description>
