  <Title>The Halls Of Reflection</Title>
  <Description>You have reforged and tempered the sword, yet it sits quietly in its sheath, showing no signs of the power it should possess. You say the sword pulls you, as though it possesses a will?$B$BDare you bring it where it wishes to go? It's not right that the sword should be this silent and this insistent, yet I fear that if you do not take the sword to its destination, we will never learn why. Take it into Icecrown Citadel's Halls of Reflection, but be on your guard! I'll be waiting for you in The Frozen Halls.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring your Tempered Quel'Delar to Sword's Rest inside the Halls of Reflection. </LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What happened inside the Halls of Reflection?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I had not thought it possible for evil to take hold in such a sword, but I suppose it was naive of me. If the greatest of dragonkind's creations could be corrupted and turned against them, why not a mere sword?$B$BUther's advice is wise, $N, and I would urge you to heed it quickly.</RewardText>
