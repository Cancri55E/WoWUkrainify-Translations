  <Title>Wrath of the Lich King</Title>
  <Description>It's hard to believe that there is much hope of defeating Arthas upon the steps of his own throne. And who will take up the crown of Lich King if it comes to that?$B$BMany questions remain, but you need to find Sylvanas and escape the Lich King while there's still time.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Lady Sylvanas Windrunner and escape the Halls of Reflection.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Yet again, vengeance slips through my grasp. It's hard to believe how much stronger he's gotten.$B$BIt was foolish of you to come for me, but it's good to know that there are still some champions of the Horde that aren't useless cowards.$B$BThe information Uther gave us may well be key to finally killing Arthas, though it is becoming more and more clear that the Horde will not be able to accomplish this on their own.$B$BGo, $c. I expect your prowess may be needed again very soon.</RewardText>
