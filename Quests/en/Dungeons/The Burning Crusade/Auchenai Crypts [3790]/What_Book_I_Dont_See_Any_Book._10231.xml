  <Description>Ramdor? Hrm, let me think... Ramdor... Oh yes, the death priest. What does he want with the book? Well it doesn't matter. Yes I lied to you and no I don't have the book. Not anymore, anyway. It was stolen. Probably by one of those filthy refugees.$B$BBesides, Auchindoun is now defunct. We have no use for the book. If you find it, you can keep it.$B$BLike I said, I saw some of those ruffians snooping around the terrace last week. Start your search with them. They're probably playing dice in the slums.</Description>
