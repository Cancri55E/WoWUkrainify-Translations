  <Title>I See Dead Draenei</Title>
  <Description>I see dead draenei. They're all around us.$B$BBah, nobody believes me because I'm a child. Not even my own mommy believes me.$B$B&lt;Ha'lei points to Ramdor.&gt;$B$BHe believes me, though... He sees them too. Boy does he get angry about it!$B$BIt's kind of funny. I see ghosts and people just smile and pat me on the head, trying to placate me. Ramdor sees ghosts and people label him as crazy. I sure hope I never grow up!$B$BYou should probably talk to Ramdor before you go inside. He was once a death priest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Ramdor the Mad, standing on the bone pile outside of the Auchenai Crypts.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The child is correct. I was once a "death priest."$B$B&lt;Ramdor winces.&gt;$B$BSuch an unsavory title.$B$BThrough that corridor lies the Auchenai Crypts. Inside you will find the remnants of my priory. They are all mad now, of course. Insane to the last! I suppose I stood out, being the last one among them with any common sense. Of course, I was excommunicated for my beliefs.$B$BWhat are my beliefs, you say?</RewardText>
