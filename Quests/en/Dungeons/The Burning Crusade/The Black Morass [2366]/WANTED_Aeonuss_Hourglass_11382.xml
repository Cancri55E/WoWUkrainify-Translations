  <Title>WANTED: Aeonus's Hourglass</Title>
  <Description>I swear that some of my customers are crazy. There are possessions that you go after, and there are ones that you dare not even think of!$B$BMy current client is clearly over-the-top insane. He covets the hourglass that Aeonus holds.$B$BYes, you heard right, Aeonus of the Infinite Dragonflight!$B$BWho am I to argue since he's paying a king's ransom? So, ready to go to the Caverns of Time and travel to the Black Morass to retrieve it for me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to acquire Aeonus's Hourglass. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.$B$BThis quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>If I were you, I would be very careful with time-travel. You wouldn't want to accidentally do something, like kill one of your ancestors, and then accidentally erase yourself from the present!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Odd that the sands in that thing are still falling upward. I think I will have it delivered to its new owner with all due haste.$B$BI thank you for a job well done, $C. You have certainly earned your commission.$B$BCome back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.</RewardText>
