  <Title>WANTED: Shaffar's Wondrous Pendant</Title>
  <Description>Today I have a personal request of you, yet the reward will certainly match the danger.$B$BMy family has a 'history', shall we say, with Nexus-Prince Shaffar and his followers. If the amulet he wears were to fall into my hands then surely that would mean that he had been dealt with.$B$BIf the bounty I am offering is of interest to you then journey to his lair within Auchindoun's Mana-Tombs.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wind Trader Zhareem wants you to obtain Shaffar's Wondrous Amulet. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.$B$BThis quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Not many know that the source of Shaffar's magic rests solely within his amulet. Without it he is powerless.$B$BThen again, if you have it that must mean that he is dead.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;You sense a deep level of satisfaction from the wind trader.&gt;$B$BGood, I am glad to hear of his demise. And perhaps I will be able to unlock the secrets of his amulet for myself. If not, then I will sell it for a handsome price.$B$BI trust that this reward is sufficient.$B$BCome back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.</RewardText>
