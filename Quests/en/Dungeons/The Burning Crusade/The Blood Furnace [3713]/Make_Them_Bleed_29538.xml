  <Title>Make Them Bleed</Title>
  <Description>The Maker uses demon blood and a special rod to turn brown and green orcs into red ones. We'd like to see if we can take that blood, mess around with it a bit, and make it turn orcs of all colors into harmless docile lumps. $B$BYou're going to bring me some samples of their blood so we can see. Don't forget to grab that rod!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Fel Orc Blood Vials and a Fel Infusion Rod for Gunny.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You have that blood, darlin'?  Might be kind of important if we asked you to get it, you know?</CompletionText>
