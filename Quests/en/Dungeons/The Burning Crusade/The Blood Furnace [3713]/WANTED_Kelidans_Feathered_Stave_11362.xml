  <Title>WANTED: Keli'dan's Feathered Stave</Title>
  <Description>There is no accounting for taste. Take my most recent buyer for instance.$B$BThere is a blood orc within Hellfire Citadel known as Keli'dan the Breaker. He bears a most mundane stave; certainly nothing to take a second glance at. And yet, this is what my customer wishes.$B$BWho am I to say no?$B$BIf you desire my compensation, you will find him and his stave within the Blood Furnace.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain Keli'dan's Feathered Stave. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.$B$BThis quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We are speaking again... you must have the stave.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Perhaps I will have new feathers tied onto it before shipping it on to the buyer. I'm certain with so many arakkoa hereabouts it will not prove difficult. A small matter, and nothing to detract from your reward in any case.$B$BCome back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.</RewardText>
