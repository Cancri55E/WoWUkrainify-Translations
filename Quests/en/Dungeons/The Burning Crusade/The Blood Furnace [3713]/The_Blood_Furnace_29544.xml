  <Title>The Blood Furnace</Title>
  <Description>Caza'rez awaits you within the Blood Furnace. He's already cleared out a small area and has our scryers hard at work figuring out what's going on down there.$B$BBut I don't trust that scrying will be enough. I'm sure Caza'rez has plans in mind for a solid blade or two. I want you to go there and lend him your expertise in dealing with the fel orcs. </Description>
