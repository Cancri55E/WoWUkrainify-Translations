  <Title>Brother Against Brother</Title>
  <Description>The Sethekk departed Skettis when Auchindoun exploded.$B$BMy brother, Syth, was one of their leaders and told us we had to go into the ruins and face our god.$B$BIn time, Syth had me cast out of the Halls for doubting them, but he refused to let me take our sister Lakka. Will you help me rescue her?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Free Lakka from captivity. Return to Isfar inside the Sethekk Halls when you've completed the rescue.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Knowing that Lakka is free means I can cut the rest of my ties to the Sethekk.$B$BPart of me will never forgive myself for Syth's death, but it had to be done. When I reach Skettis, I will perform the death rites for him.</RewardText>
