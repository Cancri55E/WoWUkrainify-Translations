  <Title>WANTED: The Signet Ring of Prince Kael'thas</Title>
  <Description>$C, today I ask the impossible. Today, you must obtain the signet ring of Kael'thas Sunstrider, lord of the blood elves!$B$BIt's true, the rumors of his death within Tempest Keep were ill-founded. He has appeared once more, this time at the Magisters' Terrace on the Isle of Quel'Danas. What he is doing there is a tale for someone else to tell you. What I know is that I have innumerable collectors interested in his princely ring, and I mean to acquire it for them.$B$BOr rather, I mean for you to do so.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain The Signet Ring of Prince Kael'thas. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.$B$BThis quest may only be completed at the Magisters' Terrace on Heroic difficulty.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The Magisters' Terrace must be a very dangerous place indeed being so close to the Sunwell.$b$bI trust that you're not having second thoughts?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>So, the blood elf prince is truly dead this time? A pity, I always thought he had class. To think that one so lofty could be brought down for such a paltry sum.$b$bBut as they say, business is business. Your reward is earned, adventurer.$b$bCome back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.</RewardText>
