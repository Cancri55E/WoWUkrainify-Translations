  <Title>WANTED: A Warp Splinter Clipping</Title>
  <Description>Not long ago, I was approached by a kaldorei druidess with a touching request. And plenty of gold, of course!$B$BIt would appear that the forces of Darnassus wish to restore an ancient of the arcane known as Warp Splinter. The giant tree has been confused or corrupted, I'm not certain, but you'll find it inside of the Botanica at Tempest Keep.$B$BShe said that all they would need to regrow him was a small clipping.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to obtain a Warp Splinter Clipping. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.$B$BThis quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you lose your way to the Botanica? You can't miss it... it's at Tempest Keep off of the eastern edge of the Netherstorm.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Aw, you did get it! It's so tiny. And yet, when the druids are done with it -- a process I am told will take a very long time -- Warp Splinter will be regrown anew.$B$BAnd here is your reward as promised.$B$BCome back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.</RewardText>
