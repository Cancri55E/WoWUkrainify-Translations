  <Title>WANTED: Pathaleon's Projector</Title>
  <Description>I always assumed that Pathaleon the Calculator used magic to project his image across Outland. Apparently I was wrong.$B$BMy latest customer tells me that the blood elf uses a mechanical device for his communication with the leaders of Prince Kael'thas's special projects. As I understand it, he acquired it from the Zaxxis rebels in the Netherstorm.$B$BMy client wishes to obtain the projector. Why don't you pay Pathaleon a visit? He can be found within the Mechanar at Tempest Keep.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wind Trader Zhareem has asked you to acquire Pathaleon's Projector. Deliver it to him in Shattrath's Lower City to collect the reward.$B$BThis quest may only be completed on Heroic difficulty.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It's not that projector technology is something special in and of itself, but the range of this particular model is a true breakthrough!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I'm tempted to keep it for myself and return my client's money. It could certainly expand the reach of my business.$B$B&lt;The wind trader sighs.&gt;$B$BHowever, I have a reputation to uphold.$B$BSpeaking of my reputation, thank you for helping me to maintain it. Here is your commission.$B$BCome back tomorrow and I will have another request for you to fulfill.</RewardText>
