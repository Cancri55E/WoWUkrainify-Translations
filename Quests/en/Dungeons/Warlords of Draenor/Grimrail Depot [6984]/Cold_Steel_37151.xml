  <Description>Do you know what I want? What everyone who came through that portal wants. Every soldier running from a world that didn't understand us, didn't need us. I want that world to love us as much as we love it.$B$BBut we don't really belong there, not anymore. War is part of us, and we can't go back. To everyone back there, we're expendable.$B$BThe only thing that makes me feel better now is the feel of a cold iron cannon in my hands, pointed at the enemy.$B$B&lt;Keeshan stares into his mug of ale.&gt;</Description>
