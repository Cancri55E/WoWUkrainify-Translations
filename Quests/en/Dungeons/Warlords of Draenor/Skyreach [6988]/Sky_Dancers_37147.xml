  <Description>Greetings, $n, and I thank you for your hospitality.$B$BThe Shado-pan have sent several warriors to aid against the Iron Horde, however we can. We are few, though, and they are many.$B$BThe arakkoa in the south are both beautiful and deadly. They appear lighter than air, their attacks a deadly dance that flits from opponent to opponent.$B$BThe winds are on their side, as the four winds lighten the steps of my own allies. Bring me a sample of their winds, if you are able. It will surely aid us.</Description>
