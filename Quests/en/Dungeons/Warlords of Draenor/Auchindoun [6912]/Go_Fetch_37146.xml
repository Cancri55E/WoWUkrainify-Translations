Perhaps you have noticed that every piece of my armor is an ancient relic, forgotten by time.$B$BAs you have properly surmised, an adventurer of my stature does not have time to complete the menial requests I am given daily. I must remain here, yelling aloud to the trade district so that others may witness my heroicness and be inspired.$B$BToday I require a Nightmare Bell, do find one.</Description>
