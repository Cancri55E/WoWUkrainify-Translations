  <Title>Vessel of Virtue</Title>
  <Description>Hello, again, commander. This plague yet vexes me, but I shall remain resolute, with the light as my guide.$B$BThe Soulweave Vessel has aided our investigations into the world beyond and the transition from life to death. With more vessels, we may be able to discover the truth behind the bridge between worlds. Perhaps there is a reason why the scourged do not fully make this transition.$B$BAny additional help would be greatly appreciated by the Argent Dawn.</Description>
