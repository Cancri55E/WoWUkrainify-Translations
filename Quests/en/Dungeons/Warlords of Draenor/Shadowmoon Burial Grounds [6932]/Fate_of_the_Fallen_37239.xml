  <Title>Fate of the Fallen</Title>
  <Description>I feel that I can trust you, perhaps. You have, at least, not spoken of my secret to anyone, and for that I thank you.$B$BI have need of your aid again, and in return, I will share some of my own information. I am here, you see, to find an elf by the name of Alleria. She was lost years ago, on Draenor. It is my faint hope that the twisting nether brought her here.$B$BI do not know if such a thing is even possible, but do keep an eye out for any signs of high elves as you travel.</Description>
