I've felt some disturbances, and they don't bode well for any of us.$B$BYes, there are things happening here, in Draenor, that are causing ripples in the nether. No, don't try to wrap your head around how that works, you'll only hurt yourself.$B$BIt's simple: bring me a Void-Gate Key, and maybe I can stop the bad things.</Description>
