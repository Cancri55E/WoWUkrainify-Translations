  <Title>Shadowy Secrets</Title>
  <Description>Though the Lich King has been defeated, we are no closer to unlocking the secrets of the Frozen Throne than we were when jousting pointlessly at the Argent Tournament. Bolvar remains resigned to his fate.$B$BPerhaps there is something here, though, that can aid us. Ner'zhul was not always the Lich King, you know. Once, he was a mere orc dabbling in dark powers beyond his comprehension.$B$BFind whatever you can of his early studies, and we may have our answers.</Description>
