Since last we spoke, I have heroically approached the gates of Blackrock Spire and nobly intended to end the toothy reign of its dragons.$B$BYet, as I neared the place, my mind drifted to thoughts of my Doloria's fair face, and to my own painfully unsatisfied desires.$b$bMy sword arm fell limp at my side.$B$BI charge THEE then, squire, to go in my stead and search Upper Blackrock Spire. I must know if the dragons still squirm within its corridors.</Description>
