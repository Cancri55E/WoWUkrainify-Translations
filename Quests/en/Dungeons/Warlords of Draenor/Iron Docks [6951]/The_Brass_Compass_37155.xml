  <Title>The Brass Compass</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, commander. I have come on a mission directly from the captain.$B$BAboard any vessel on Azeroth that's manned by at least one orc, you'll hear sea shanties sung about a device capable of navigating the broad, rough ocean of Draenor. The orcs used it to keep their heading true in the choppiest of storms.$B$BPerhaps it's just an old sea tale, but this one chance to find that kind of prize has the captain willing to part with some fine treasure.</Description>
