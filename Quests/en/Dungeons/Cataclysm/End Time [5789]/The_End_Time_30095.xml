  <Title>The End Time</Title>
  <Description>Nozdormu, the bronze Aspect, has asked for help from the champions of the Alliance. You are on his short list. I can share few other details.$b$bIt is uncharacteristic of my master to request the assistance of mortals, but I suppose that all things change with time... even the Aspect of Time himself.$b$bHe awaits you at the End Time, in the distant future. I can help you to travel there, if you so choose.</Description>
