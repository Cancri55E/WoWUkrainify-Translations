Time is highly relative.$b$bI require more information for our archive. While you and Nozdormu don't intend to overwrite this timestrand, as you did in the End Time, we can still benefit from more data.$b$bI require information on Captain Varo'then, one of Azshara's pretty little handmaidens, and... hmm... oh, how about that big felguard, just down those stairs?</Description>
