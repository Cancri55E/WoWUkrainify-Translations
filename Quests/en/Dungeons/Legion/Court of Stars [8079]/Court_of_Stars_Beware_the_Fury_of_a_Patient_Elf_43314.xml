  <Title>Court of Stars: Beware the Fury of a Patient Elf</Title>
  <Description>An opportunity presents itself, $n.

Ly'leth has arranged to grant you entry into a ball at the Court of Stars. I do not know what we may gain from this venture, but there is one task I must set for you.

Advisor Melandrus once called himself my ally. He and I planned Elisande's downfall, but when the moment came I found myself betrayed.

The wound his dagger inflicted still aches. I cannot enter Suramar to take my revenge, but you can.

Give him a traitor's death, and bring me his spellstone.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Enter the Court of Stars dungeon and slay Advisor Melandrus. Collect his Spellstone and return it to Thalyssra.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is it done?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Thalyssra clutches the spellstone tightly for a moment.&gt;$b$bHe brought this upon himself.$b$bI cannot linger in the past. Elisande is weaker without him, and we are one step closer to righting the wrongs inflicted upon the shal'dorei.</RewardText>
