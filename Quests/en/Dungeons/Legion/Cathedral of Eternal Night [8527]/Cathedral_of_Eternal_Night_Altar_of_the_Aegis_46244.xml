  <Title>Cathedral of Eternal Night: Altar of the Aegis</Title>
  <Description>Champion, we are ready to assault the Tomb of Sargeras.

I studied the writings of Aegwynn, the Guardian who defeated the Dark Titan's avatar. She said that if her wards were compromised, a failsafe could be triggered by placing the Aegis of Aggramar upon an altar in the Cathedral of Eternal Night.

You are the hero who acquired the Pillars of Creation, $n. Gather your allies and enter the Cathedral. Be warned: Mephistroth will use all his power to stop you from placing the Aegis. You must prevail!</Description>
