  <Title>Return to Karazhan: Book Wyrms</Title>
  <Description>My incorporeal condition has allowed me to enter the tower safely for the first time. I must say, it's a bit of a shambles in there!$b$bI could use some help tackling my cleaning checklist. We should start with the library. All those musty tomes are bound to attract mana wyrms!$b$bPlease shelve any books that have fallen to the floor, or worse, taken flight. And if you find mana wyrms nibbling at the pages... step on them!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Clean up the Karazhan Library.</LogDescription>
