  <Title>Return to Karazhan: Master of the House</Title>
  <Description>Inside the pocket watch is a worn note.

"The next affair will take place in Morgan's Plot, it will cause quite a stir! The following guests will be in attendance:

Lord Ference, his preferred vintage is red.
Baroness Millstipe, she will only attend on the promise of cheese. Strange woman.
Baron Dreuger, a ravenous soul, any well spiced meat should keep him happy.

As always, I shall ring the bell should I need you.
