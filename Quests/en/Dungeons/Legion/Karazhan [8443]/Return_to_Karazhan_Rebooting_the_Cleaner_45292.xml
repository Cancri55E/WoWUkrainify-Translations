  <Title>Return to Karazhan: Rebooting the Cleaner</Title>
  <Description>The Guardian Medivh created the Curator to watch over Karazhan, but I fear the unit is behaving erratically. Prolonged periods of operation may have caused a malfunction.$B$BPlease go up to the Menagerie and disable the Curator. Also, search the area for a box of spare motivator crystals and return to me.$b$bEven with my basic knowledge I should be able to replace its motivator, and we can enlist the Curator's help in cleaning up the tower.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Disable the Curator and find the Box of Spare Motivator Crystals.</LogDescription>
