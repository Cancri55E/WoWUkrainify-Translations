  <Title>Return to Karazhan: New Shoes</Title>
  <Description>Thus far my Karazhan cleanup project hasn't exactly been a rousing success. Time to try something new.$B$BNew, as in new shoes... horseshoes, that is! A box of horseshoes was left outside the tower. It's a problem finding a delivery person willing to set foot inside... mortality rates being what they are.$B$BIf you would, grab the crate and take it to Koren in the stables. Just be careful passing Attumen. The huntsman doesn't take kindly to outsiders.</Description>
