  <Title>The Seat of the Triumvirate: Armor of the Triumvirate</Title>
  <Description>This reforged key will grant entry into the armory inside the Seat of the Triumvirate.

Locked away inside is the Armor of the Triumvirate, crafted in the days before Sargeras brought ruin to our world. We cannot let this armor be stolen by the Void's forces.

Once the armor is in your possession, please bring it to Archivist Ionaa. He has collected our most sacred relics in the cave just up the path. No doubt he would be very glad to receive it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Secure the Armor of the Light and bring it to Archivist Ionaa.</LogDescription>
