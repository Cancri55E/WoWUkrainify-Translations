  <Title>Toll for the Soul</Title>
  <Description>[PH] As foretold, you have arrived... Helya is foolish to think I'll let her ferry me into Helheim. Odyn has already smiled upon me, my soul belongs in Valhallas. 

Make no mistake, I am not a prisoner. Before my death Odyn appeared to me in the form of a raven. He praised my battles in life and gave me a quest no vrykul could refuse. The Helerjar arrived... and I let them slay me.

Prisoner-- nay, I am a liberator, sent by Odyn to free the souls of Valarjar.</Description>
