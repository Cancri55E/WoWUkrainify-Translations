  <Title>How to Save a God</Title>
  <Description>Many mortal souls suffer within the Maw. But so too do many spirits of Nature.

Anima alone cannot heal wounds inflicted by the Jailer. Spirits plucked from his grasp must be planted anew and tended with care.

These wildseeds are unlike any other. This grove, unlike any other. Within them lies dormant hope, a chance for even the weakest spirit to be reborn.

One such as this. Lay this spirit to rest within a wildseed. Let its rebirth begin.</Description>
