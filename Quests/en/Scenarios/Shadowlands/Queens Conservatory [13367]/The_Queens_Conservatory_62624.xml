  <Title>The Queen's Conservatory</Title>
  <Description>I have heard that you are aiding us in restoring our sanctum, $n. 

There is a very special magical grove that we know as The Queen's Conservatory. 

Within this magical sanctuary we nurture the spirits of old deities back to life. But its magic has waned with the anima drought. 

It is in need of your help.

It would mean the world to us if you could start the restoration process by acquiring the resources we need.</Description>
