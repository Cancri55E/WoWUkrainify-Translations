  <Title>Greeting a God</Title>
  <Description>Soon, the moment of the spirit's rebirth will be nigh. A fate all but extinguished by the Maw, rekindled by grove and caretaker.

Time will be the spirit's salve. Once enough of it has passed, lay your hands upon the wildseed and awaken them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wait for the spirit to finish incubating, then open the wildseed.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>And so a god is reborn by the hand of a mortal.

They greeted you with gratitude, yes? And perhaps surprise, as well.</RewardText>
