  <Title>A Rare and Unusual Spirit</Title>
  <Description>I have a mystery for you, $n!

Who doesn't savor a good mystery? 

We have found a spirit unlike any other, one who does not respond to being placed in a wildseed.

Each of us who touched it experienced a dream in which we saw you battling a great beast. Only when you defeated it did the spirit begin on its path to rebirth. 

We think we know the beast.

Are you up for discovering if these dreams were a portent?</Description>
