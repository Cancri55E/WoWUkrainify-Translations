  <Title>Rebirth of the Grove</Title>
  <Description>Though not yet withered, the conservatory wilts amidst the drought. This grove is not what it once was.

As warden, I bear the twin burdens of guilt and shame. Fate saw to this grove's decay and my failure to prevent it.

But fate has also seen to hope in its renewal. Hope in you.

I beseech you, mortal, to seek out Zayhad in the Heart of the Forest and restore what has been lost.

For as the wounded spirits must be reborn, so too must this grove.</Description>
