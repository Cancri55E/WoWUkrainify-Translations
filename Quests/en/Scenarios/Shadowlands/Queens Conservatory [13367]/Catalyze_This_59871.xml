  <Title>Catalyze This</Title>
  <Description>The grove grows in power, and so shall the spirits it shelters.

You have nurtured a spirit to rebirth on your own. Now you must learn to make use of catalysts.

When planted near a wildseed, catalysts grant the slumbering spirit strength beyond what it knew in life. Strength that it retains when reborn.

Catalysts are special and rare, though I have one here for you to use. Others can be found across the Shadowlands.

For now, plant the catalyst and witness the potential it holds.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the catalyst on the catalyst plot.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Nature holds as many secrets as it does gifts.</RewardText>
