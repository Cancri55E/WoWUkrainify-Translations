  <Title>In Search of Inner Calm</Title>
  <Description>We have already experienced so much together.

I am grateful to have a companion on this voyage of discovery.

You walk where I can only project.

You touch that which I can only see.

I have had another dream.

Another coast. A statue. 

A large statue of a little one. 

Go, seek out the view from my dream.</Description>
