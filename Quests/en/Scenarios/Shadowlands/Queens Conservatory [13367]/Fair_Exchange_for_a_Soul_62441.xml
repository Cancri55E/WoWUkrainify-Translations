  <Title>Fair Exchange for a Soul</Title>
  <Description>While we work away here in the Conservatory, we must not forget to support the rest of the covenant.

I am needed here, but you can range far, even though your legs are short. 

Please, help our covenant recover the anima we need. I can then dedicate my time to preparing another spirit for you to restore.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect anima for your Sanctum.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You continue to serve the conservatory well. For this you have my thanks.

Now you may choose from the spirits I have collected myself for restoration.</RewardText>
