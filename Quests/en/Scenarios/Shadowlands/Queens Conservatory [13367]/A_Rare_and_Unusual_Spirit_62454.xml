  <Title>A Rare and Unusual Spirit</Title>
  <Description>I awaken. I exist once more. And yet...

There is an emptiness within. A lingering tether to a home that no longer exists. So much wonder... so much splendor... lost.

Now I have no purpose. No fate. No path.

Will you teach me of this place, awakener? I sense there is much to be understood. Many secrets. Many truths.

In so doing, perhaps a new fate will emerge.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Falir and bring them essences from the realms of the Shadowlands.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Perhaps a new purpose awaits me.

You have rekindled my curiosity, at least.</RewardText>
