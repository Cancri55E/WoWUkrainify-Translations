  <Title>The Grove Resplendent</Title>
  <Description>You have done much to return the conservatory to its former splendor.

In ages past, this grove was a place of convalescence for spirits who were wounded upon their demise, and needed special care before being reborn.

It was a place rarely used... but now, it is critical to the continuation of the cycle.

Tell Zayhad that the time has come. The Queen's Conservatory must thrive for the good of Ardenweald.</Description>

Thank you, Maw Walker.</RewardText>
