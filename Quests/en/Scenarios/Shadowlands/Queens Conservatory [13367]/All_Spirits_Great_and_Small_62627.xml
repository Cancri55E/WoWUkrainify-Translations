  <Title>All Spirits Great and Small</Title>
  <Description>This is a most curious place.

So much energy of rebirth. A fusion of different forms of magic. Not what I expected.

I too was committed to rebirth among my kind. This magic is both known to me, and like nothing I have seen before. Yet it all serves to balance. 

It is not just great spirits of import that help to maintain the cosmic balance.

Even the smallest of creatures can play a role. 

I can show you if you like? Visit the remains of one such creature, and we shall rekindle its spirit.</Description>
