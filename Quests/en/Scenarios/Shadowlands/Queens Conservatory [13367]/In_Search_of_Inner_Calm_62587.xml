  <Title>In Search of Inner Calm</Title>
  <Description>I have always had dreams.

Special dreams you could say.

Any place of tranquility or calm can come to me in a dream.

Even those that may have danger nearby, as calm can be found anywhere, if you know how.

Now I dream of your world, your Azeroth. 

I cannot travel to your realm. Help me connect to my latest dream through your eyes.

I have dreamed of a high place. A very high place. Do you know it?</Description>
