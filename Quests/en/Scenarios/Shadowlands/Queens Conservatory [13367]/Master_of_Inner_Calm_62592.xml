  <Title>Master of Inner Calm</Title>
  <Description>You have come a long way.

You are almost prepared to access your inner calm anywhere.

Just one more journey under my guidance.

One more location of calm to experience.

Then you shall shed your spiritual shackles. 

I shall be proud.</Description>
