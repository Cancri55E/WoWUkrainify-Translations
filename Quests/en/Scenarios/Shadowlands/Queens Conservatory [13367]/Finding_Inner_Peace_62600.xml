  <Title>Finding Inner Peace</Title>
  <Description>This is a lovely spot don't you think?

I knew the myths of Ardenweald. 

Even glimpsed it in dream.

Yet it swells with tranquility unimagined. 

Calm is what my kind live for. Even in chaos.

You can always find calm. I can show you if you would like? 

I can sense a nearby convergence of calm. That will provide a suitable demonstration.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel out into Ardenweald to commune with the calm of the land.</LogDescription>
