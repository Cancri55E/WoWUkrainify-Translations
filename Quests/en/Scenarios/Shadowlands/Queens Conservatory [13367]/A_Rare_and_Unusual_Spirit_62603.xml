  <Title>A Rare and Unusual Spirit</Title>
  <Description>I'm glad to see you again, friend!

We have found another inert spirit gripped by dark dreams. Nasty stuff! 

In this dream, a noble figure that once embodied loyalty has been consumed by their own doubts, leading them down a dark path.

If you were to defeat the fallen paragon, I bet we'll be able to revive this poor spirit.

Will you help us once more, $n?</Description>
