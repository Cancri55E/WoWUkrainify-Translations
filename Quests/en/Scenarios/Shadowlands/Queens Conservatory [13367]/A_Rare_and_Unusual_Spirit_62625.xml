  <Title>A Rare and Unusual Spirit</Title>
  <Description>It's a joy to see the progress you've made in the restoration of the conservatory, $n!

But there's still more work to be done.

We have found another inert spirit. A dark dream is preventing its awakening.

In this dream, the spirit is caught in the midst of a feud between ancient beings. Both are a bit on the unsavory side, but one is much, much worse than the other!

If you were to defeat the Father of Sleep, it should nudge the spirit from its slumber. Will you help?</Description>
