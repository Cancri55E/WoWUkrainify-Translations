  <Title>Dungeon: Darkmaul Citadel</Title>
  <Description>Gor'groth plans to raise a powerful dragon, Ravnyr, from the dead.

He conducts the dark ritual atop this citadel. You have stymied his efforts by saving me and my crew.

You must storm the citadel and stop him from completing the ritual. His dark magic is an affront to the Light.

We will need all the help we can get. Gor'groth's most elite lieutenants await within the citadel.</Description>
