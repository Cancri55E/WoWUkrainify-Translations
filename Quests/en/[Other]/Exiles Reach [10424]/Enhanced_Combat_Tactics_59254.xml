  <Description>Alaria says that the quilboar kidnapped the rest of the expedition... including my son.

Chances are we'll have to brave the quilboar's den. That's no small feat. They are far more aggressive and intelligent than the murlocs you faced earlier.

I need to make sure I'm not sending you to your death. We're going to have one last sparring session.</Description>
