  <Title>Murloc Mania</Title>
  <Description>I'm glad you made it out in one piece. 

Judging by the nearby shipwrecks, I think it's safe to say the missing expedition ran aground here, too.

We can't move until we've got the remaining survivors back on their feet. 

Unfortunately, our remaining supplies have been stolen by murlocs! Annoying little pests...

I need you to recover enough first aid supplies for the wounded. 

Then we can begin searching for the missing expedition.</Description>
