  <Title>A Paladin's Service</Title>
  <Description>I found something strange while using Lindie's Scout-o-Matic that you should probably know about.

The ghost of a paladin appeared on the hill nearby. She looked straight at the Scout-o-Matic and asked for you.

I don't understand a whole lot about paladins and the Light, but I think you may not want to ignore her.</Description>
