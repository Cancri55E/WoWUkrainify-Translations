  <Title>Right Beneath Their Eyes</Title>
  <Description>We need to get into Darkmaul Citadel, rescue the last survivor, and stop the ogre necromancer behind all of this.

Herbert and Crenna are going to cast a spell to make you look an ogre... and then you're going to take us in as your "prisoners."

We do not have the strength to launch a full scale assault, so this will have to do.

Speak with Herbert when you're ready.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Have Herbert Gloomburst transform you into an ogre, then scout the nearby ogre citadel.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>There may just be a way that we can save Warlord Thunderwalker.</RewardText>
