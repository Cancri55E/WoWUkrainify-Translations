  <Title>The Harpy Problem</Title>
  <Description>Thanks for saving me, $n. I'll do my best to be of help to you.

We need to find the remaining survivors of my expedition before the ogres sacrifice them for their dark ritual!

I saw one of the survivors being dragged away by some harpies. They have a roost to the north.

Kee-La and I will meet you up there with a scouting report.</Description>
