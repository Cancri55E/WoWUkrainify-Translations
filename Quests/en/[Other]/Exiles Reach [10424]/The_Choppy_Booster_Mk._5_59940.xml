  <Title>The Choppy Booster Mk. 5</Title>
  <Description>You're lookin' for Shuja Grimaxe, right? Gotta tell ya, she's kinda intense. Always goin' on about usin' her own strength to get ahead.

But you're in luck, 'cause I'm the ONE goblin who can help you find her AND the rest of the expedition!

Feast your eyes on this fancy device here. Stole it off a gnome, improved on it, and made it my own!

I call it the Choppy Booster Mk. 5. Use it to find Shuja and the others.</Description>
