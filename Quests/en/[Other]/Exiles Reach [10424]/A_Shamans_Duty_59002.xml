  <Title>A Shaman's Duty</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, young one. Your companions cannot see me. Only you, for you have been trained in the ways of a shaman.

The necrotic energies of this island have ensnared my pack. I need your aid to free them.

Gather veil blossoms from the surrounding area. Burn them on the campfire and breath deep of their smoke.

Then you will be able to see my packmates and release them from their bonds.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather $1oa veil blossoms to burn on the campfire in order to rescue the ghost wolf's pack.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>My pack and I are too weak to oppose the dark forces on this island.

We will use the last of our strength to grant you our power.

Use it to rid the island of the ogres' necromancy.

Free the countless souls they have trapped here.</RewardText>
