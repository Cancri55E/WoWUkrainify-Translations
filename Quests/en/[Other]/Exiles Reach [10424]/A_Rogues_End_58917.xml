  <Title>A Rogue's End</Title>
  <Description>A rogue from the lost expedition, Coulston Nereus, tried scouting the island for any threats after they made landfall.

The last time Henry saw him, he was headed for a cave not far from here.

Can you make contact with Coulston? He may be able to help with our rescue mission.

Oh, and be careful when heading north. Alaria spotted a vicious bear roaming the area.</Description>
