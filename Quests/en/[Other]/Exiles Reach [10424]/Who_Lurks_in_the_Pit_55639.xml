  <Title>Who Lurks in the Pit</Title>
  <Description>The winds whisper of people being trapped in the pit. It seems there may be more members of the expedition within.

I fear it will be up to you to make the descent and save the survivors.

There should be six in total...  though the winds say that one is farther away from the others...

With our luck, the last survivor is at the bottom of the pit.

Good luck, $n. And... make sure no spiders follow you back out.</Description>
