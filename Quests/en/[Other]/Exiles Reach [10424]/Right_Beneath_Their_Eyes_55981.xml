  <Title>Right Beneath Their Eyes</Title>
  <Description>We need to get inside Darkmaul Citadel, rescue the captain of the expedition, and stop the ogre necromancer behind all of this.

Meredy is going to cast an illusion to make you look like an ogre, and you're going to take us all in as "prisoners."

This plan is... inventive. But it's the best way to get us behind enemy lines.

Speak with Meredy when you're ready for her to cast the spell.

She assures me the effects will be temporary.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Have Meredy transform you into an ogre, then scout the nearby ogre citadel.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We're close to stopping all of this. We just need to push a little further.</RewardText>
