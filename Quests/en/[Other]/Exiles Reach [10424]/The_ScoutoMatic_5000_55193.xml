Luckily, you have happened to rescue the one and only Lindie Springstock, inventor extraordinaire! 

I've got my Scout-o-Matic 5000 all set to go. It'll fly up in the air and let you scout the entire area.

I'll give you the honors. Use my Scout-o-Matic 5000 to find Henry and the rest of the expedition!</Description>
