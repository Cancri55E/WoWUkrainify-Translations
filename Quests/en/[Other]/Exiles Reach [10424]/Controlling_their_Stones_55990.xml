  <Title>Controlling their Stones</Title>
  <Description>Captain Kelra won't last much longer. We need to acquire the ward stones to break the ritual before it kills her.

We'll hold the line here. Take out the ogre's lieutenants and get those ward stones!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover the Ward Stones from Jugnug, Wug, and Grunk, then use them to free Captain Kelra.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>So, these were the stones used to bind me? The ogres clearly were concerned about you thwarting their plans.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for saving me, but we have no time to lose. The ogres will not stop until they have raised the dragon!</RewardText>
