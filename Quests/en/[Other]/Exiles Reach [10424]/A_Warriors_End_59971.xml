  <Title>A Warrior's End</Title>
  <Description>Hail, $n! You've grown stronger since we sparred on the boat. You may one day become a warrior of great renown!

Speaking of which...

I encountered a ghost on the bridge to the north that demands to meet a true warrior.

Perhaps you can see what it wants.

It did not seem hostile. It might even be willing to help us.</Description>
