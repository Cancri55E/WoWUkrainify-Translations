  <Title>Like Ogres to the Slaughter</Title>
  <Description>This is bad, $n. Captain Kelra is bound by magic, the ogres are preparing to attack our friends, and the ritual is almost complete!

I have to stay calm. We can't give up now, right?

This may sound risky, but we need to take the fight to the ogres.

We're behind enemy lines, so we'll be able to get the jump on them and draw their focus away from the camp.

Take down any ogres that you can. That should keep them away from our friends.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay $1oa ogres within Darkmaul Citadel.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This should buy us enough time to stop the ritual!</RewardText>
