  <Title>A Druid's Form</Title>
  <Description>Thank you for rescuing me, $n. Allow me to aid you in your druidic studies.

To escape from the pit, I took on the form of a stag. I may know of a way you can learn to do the same.

Come with me. There is an ancient druid stone nearby. Let us use it to commune with the wilds.</Description>

  <RewardText>Good! I can sense the blessing of the spirits flowing through you.

Focus, and you should find that you can take on a new form.</RewardText>
