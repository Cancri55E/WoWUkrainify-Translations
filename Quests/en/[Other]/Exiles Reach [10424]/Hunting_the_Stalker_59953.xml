  <Title>Hunting the Stalker</Title>
  <Description>Now that you have your trap, we can move onto the true problem at hand.

A strange creature not native to this island has been stalking our camp.

I think we should capture it and see how it can help us.

Set the freezing trap within these ruins to lure it out. We'll see just what we are dealing with.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use your Freezing Trap within the Ogre Ruins to lure out the beast stalking the camp.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I admit, I am rather ashamed I did not immediately recognize this beast.

It must be quite resilient if it was able to survive this long on its own!

Here, let me teach you another trick. You'll want to have multiple pets to switch between if you're to be a hunter of any worth.</RewardText>
