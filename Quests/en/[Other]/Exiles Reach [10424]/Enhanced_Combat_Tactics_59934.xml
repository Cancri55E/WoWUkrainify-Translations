  <Description>Won'sa said the quilboar have kidnapped the missing expedition... including my daughter.

The quilboar will kill you if you're not prepared. They're much smarter and deadlier than murlocs.

I won't see you die by their hands. We're going to spar one last time.

When we are done, you will cleave a path straight through the quilboar!</Description>
