  <Title>Re-sizing the Situation</Title>
  <Description>I call this gadget "the Re-Sizer." It's what I used to unshrink the Choppy Booster Mk. 5.

Look, I'm gonna be honest. I got, at best, a passing understandin' of how this thing works.

That means I'm gonna be pushing a lot of buttons to see what happens.

I'm sure we'll figure out how to upsize one of these boars. Then we'll use it to trample those undead goons!

You hold the Re-Sizer while I fiddle with it. Then just press the button and, uh... hope for the best?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Re-Sizer on $1oa Wandering Boars.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak with Warleader Breka.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>So the giant boar was a fool's errand, and you turned the device into a weapon instead?

Good work. Let's see if you can pull this off.</RewardText>
