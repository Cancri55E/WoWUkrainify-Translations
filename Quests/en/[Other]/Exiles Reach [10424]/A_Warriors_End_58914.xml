  <Title>A Warrior's End</Title>
  <Description>Hey, $n! You're a $c, right? Maybe you can deal with this... situation.

I was scouting the area with Lindie's device and saw a ghost who was offering power to any "true" warriors.

I know you're still new at this, but why don't you try going over there? 

We could use every advantage against these ogres.</Description>
