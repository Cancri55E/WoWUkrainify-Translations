  <Title>The Rescue of Herbert Gloomburst</Title>
  <Description>The harpies plan to sacrifice the expedition's mage, a Forsaken by the name of Herbert Gloomburst.

Our foes seek to use this vile necromancy even on the undead. 

Herbert's ethics are... questionable, but he always strives to serve the Horde. We'll need his magic to stop the ogres.

Let's move.</Description>
