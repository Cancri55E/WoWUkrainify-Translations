  <Title>Hunting the Stalker</Title>
  <Description>Now that you have your trap, there's a problem we need to deal with.

A wild beast has been stalking our camp. It's already stolen some of our food. We have little enough as it is.

You and I will work together. Set your freezing trap and lure out whatever this creature is.

Once it is caught, I will determine if the beast can be tamed... or if it needs to be put down.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use your Freezing Trap within the Ogre Ruins to lure out the beast stalking the camp.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you for the help, $n. I have one last lesson to impart--calling a different companion to your side.

There are plenty of wild beasts on this island. See which ones you can tame.</RewardText>
