  <Title>Who Lurks in the Pit</Title>
  <Description>There's a whole lot of necrotic energy coming from this pit. I'm guessing a ritual is being performed down there. And that means a sacrifice.

Do you hear that? I've got the best hearing around, ever since I got this new ear sewn onto me.

It sounds like there are some more of our soldiers trapped down there. Probably all webbed up.

Won'sa and I will... stay up here and help anyone who gets out.

You should jump in and rescue anyone who is left down there!</Description>
