  <Title>A Priest's End</Title>
  <Description>You're a trained priest, right $n? This might be up your alley.

We've spotted the bodies of other recruits from our expedition.

I'm guessing they washed up on a different part of the island. They didn't make it very far.

When you have a moment, could you say a few prayers over them? Just to help put their spirits at ease.

We'll give them a proper burial once we deal with the ogres.</Description>

  <RewardText>There's no time fer chatting. I'm going tae bless ye with the power to resurrect.

I'd give ye a bit more ceremony, but we got an urgent problem on our hands.

If we don't hurry, the souls of these poor recruits will be consumed by the ogre's necromancy!</RewardText>
