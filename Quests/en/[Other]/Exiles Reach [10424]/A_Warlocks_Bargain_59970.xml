  <Title>A Warlock's Bargain</Title>
  <Description>While scouting the area, I saw an open portal near the bridge up the hill. That does not bode well for any of us.

It seemed like another warlock tried to seal the portal, but failed.

I know you dabble in such... affairs. Perhaps you could put your knowledge to good use and close that portal.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Investigate the first expedition warlock's corpse.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak with your now loyal voidwalker.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Our bargain has been struck.

Call upon me from the Void, and I will answer.

&lt;The voidwalker looks at the goblin's corpse.&gt;

Let us see if you are stronger than those who came before you.</RewardText>
