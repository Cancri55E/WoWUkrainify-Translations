  <Title>A Hunter's Trap</Title>
  <Description>By now, most hunters would have been trained in the art of trapping. Allow me to get you up to speed.

We'll start with a freezing trap. In order to make one, you'll have to forage materials from your surroundings.

Meredy can provide you with a mote of ice. Scavenge the area for the rest of what is required.

And don't delay. You will need that freezing trap to deal with a problem that has cropped up within the camp.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Scavenge parts in the area to create a Freezing Trap.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get the supplies needed? Meredy should have the ice mote, while the other two should be nearby.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>With a little work, this can become a trap you can use. 

Part of being a hunter means making use of what your surroundings provide.</RewardText>
