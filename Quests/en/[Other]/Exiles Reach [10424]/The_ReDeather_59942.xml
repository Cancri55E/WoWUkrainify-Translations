  <Title>The Re-Deather</Title>
  <Description>I got the perfect plan. You're gonna ride the Choppy Booster Mk. 5 and BLAST those walkin' cadavers from the sky!

I hereby dub the Re-Sizer the "Re-Deather." We're gonna show them where the undead belong!

Er, except for OUR undead. They're totally fine.

Anyway, hop on the Choppy Booster Mk. 5 and I'll pilot it.

Once we save Shuja Grimaxe, we'll blast our way to all the other survivors!</Description>
