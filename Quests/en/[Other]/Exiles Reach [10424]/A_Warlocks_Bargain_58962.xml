  <Title>A Warlock's Bargain</Title>
  <Description>While you were mowing down hordes of undead, I was scouting more of the area with Lindie's device.

I saw what looked like a portal out near the bridge, along with the corpse of a warlock we thought was lost in the shipwreck.

Think you can go investigate the area and try to close that portal? We have enough problems on this island as it is.</Description>
