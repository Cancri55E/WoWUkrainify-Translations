  <Title>Dungeon: Darkmaul Citadel</Title>
  <Description>Gor'groth seeks to raise a powerful dragon, Ravnyr, from the dead. 

He's collected enough life essence to attempt to finish the ritual... even if it means Ravnyr will not be at her full strength.

Gor'groth will not stop until he is slain!

You must storm the citadel and slay Gor'groth before he can complete his ritual!

I would charge in beside you, were I not still recovering from his dark magic.</Description>
