  <Title>Ride of the Scientifically Enhanced Boar</Title>
  <Description>We don't know how long the re-sizing will last, so let's get moving.

We're going to ride this giant boar and mow down the army of undead between us and Henry.

The large ones are pulsing with dark magic. If we kill them, I bet it they'll take out any enemies near them.

Hopefully, Henry will know more about whatever the ogres are planning.</Description>

  <RewardText>Thank you, stranger. I thought I was going to be punished for failing to save my friends.

I'm relieved that I was mistaken.</RewardText>
