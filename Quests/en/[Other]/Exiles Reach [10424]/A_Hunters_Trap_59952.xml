  <Title>A Hunter's Trap</Title>
  <Description>If you want to be called a true hunter, you'll need to learn the art of trapping.

Fortunately, I happen to be an expert in it.

First, you will need to gather supplies from the surrounding area so you can fashion a proper freezing trap.

Herbert can supply you with a mote of ice. Scavenge the area for other materials.

You will need the trap to handle another issue that has recently arisen.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Scavenge parts in the area to create a Freezing Trap.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>With a little work, this can become an effective trap.

Part of what makes a real hunter is the resourcefulness to use what your environment provides.</RewardText>
