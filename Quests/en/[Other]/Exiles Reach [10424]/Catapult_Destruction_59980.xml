  <Title>Catapult Destruction</Title>
  <Description>Did you see the catapults lined up on the way over here?

Seems like the ogres are planning to hurl who knows what at our camp. Good thing I came prepared!

Cork gave me some of his explosives as a contingency plan.

I was going to save them for some enemies back in Orgrimmar... but I suppose you should use them here instead.

Blow up the catapults before they fire on our camp!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Blow up $1oa catapults within Darkmaul Citadel.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Good work! You didn't happen to save any of those explosives, did you?

...I didn't think so. Oh well! I have plenty of other ways to blow up my enemies.</RewardText>
