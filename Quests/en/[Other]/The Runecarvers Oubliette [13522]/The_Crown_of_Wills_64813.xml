  <Title>The Crown of Wills</Title>
  <Description>When I created Domination, I did not foresee how much pain it would cause the realms. Not only the Shadowlands, but yours as well.

It is time we take this helm, this symbol of that magic, and reforge it anew. But, not for the same purpose it once had.

Let it represent the strength of will that you and your kind possess, so that it may help us overcome and defeat Zovaal at last.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Reforge the Helm of Domination.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This is a power unlike any I have felt before. We have made something new.

It will be our key to defeating Zovaal.</RewardText>
