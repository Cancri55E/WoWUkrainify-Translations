  <Title>Forge of Domination</Title>
  <Description>We have all of the pieces we need. The broken half of the helm has been augmented with the complexity of the language of the First Ones, and the shards bear our memories. 

Our will to resist Domination.

All that remains is for the Primus to reforge the Helm, then we will be able to draw upon that combined power for ourselves.

I know that it is dangerous, but it is our only hope.</Description>
