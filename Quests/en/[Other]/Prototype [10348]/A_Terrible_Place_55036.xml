  <Title>A Terrible Place</Title>
  <Description>You may have noticed all the disturbances happening around Azeroth. The Old God is rising, and its bad news for all of us.

On occasion, one of these Pillars of Endless Truth will appear. Wonderful name don't you think? I have a knack for naming things. 

Where was I? Oh yes, right, these Pillars grant one access to the very mind of the Old God himself. They will show you a hint of what might yet come, what this world will look like should we fail to defeat him.

Are you willing to see for yourself?</Description>
