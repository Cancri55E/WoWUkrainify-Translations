  <Title>Stemming the Irontide</Title>
  <Description>Unfortunately, we are not the only ones who took notice of opportunities in the Reach. 

Our scouts have sent word of pirate vessels moored offshore. The first longboats have apparently come ashore on our northeastern beaches.

Our history is not theirs to plunder. If you come across these pirates, send them swimming back to their little boats.</Description>
