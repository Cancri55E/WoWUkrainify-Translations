  <Title>An Eclectic Accord</Title>
  <Description>While the storm over the Reach was raging, I gathered allies for our eventual return. I want to ensure they have everything they need, but I can't welcome all of them personally.

Would you be my envoy, $n? Can you make sure they have what they need? We have few supplies to offer and a shortage of assistance. 

The least I can do is offer my gratitude. Please thank them personally on my behalf.</Description>
