  <Title>Welcome to the Darkmoon Races</Title>
  <Description>So this is your first race, eh? Don't worry - it's easier than it looks. Let me break it down for you...

Run through that big  banner there. That starts everything. Then, follow the smaller banners until you see a big, blue Post. Hit that, then return here.

You're scored on your time, so finish as fast as you can! And watch out for those electrified tripwires. They'll slow you down if you run through them. Good luck!</Description>
