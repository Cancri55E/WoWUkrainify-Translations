  <Description>The importance of this expedition can not be understated. I assure you, all who participate will have a place in history... along with me, of course!

If I can make one remarkable discovery, my scholarly legacy will be assured! But what will we find? A copy of Neltharion's signature? One of his personal letters? Can't wait to find something to share with my fans. Also, I'll have more fans!

If you would be so kind as to find me something memorable, I'll offer you suitable remuneration! I can pay!</Description>
