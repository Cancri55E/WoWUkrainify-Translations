  <Title>Bringing the Bass</Title>
  <Description>It's a bit quiet around here, in between the invasions and all.

You're in luck though, Commander! I can fix that, and boost morale among your troops all at the same time.

All you need to do is bring me a few items from around Draenor, and I'll fill your garrison with music. I'll even throw in a few music rolls from my own collection to get you started!

What do you say?</Description>
