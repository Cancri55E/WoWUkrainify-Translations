  <Title>The Great Akazamzarak</Title>
  <Description>There is a goblin who is a master of portals and teleportation by the name of Akazamzarak. His talents have gone mostly unnoticed, however, since he mostly uses them for chicanery.

He is, what you would call, a street performer.

Fortunately for us, he is performing in the streets of Dalaran, grifting coins from the unenlightened masses.

Take this bag of gold. See if you can convince him to change vocations.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place the Sizeable Pouch of Gold in Akazamzarak's tip bucket.</LogDescription>
