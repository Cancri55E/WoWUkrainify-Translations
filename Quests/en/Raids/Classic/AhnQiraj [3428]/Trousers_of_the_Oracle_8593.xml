  <Title>Trousers of the Oracle</Title>
  <Description>You seek to prove your worth to my kind, mortal?  Very well, perhaps we can be of mutual assistance.$B$BThe ancient sandworm, Ouro, is a being of legendary power.  He is rumored to have been created by the Old God himself as a mockery of life.$B$BHis skin is unnatural... thick, nearly impregnable, yet it's flexible and allows him to move with the speed and grace of a much smaller creature.$B$BBring me a sample of his skin along with other minor components and I shall craft you leggings of great power.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Ouro's Intact Hide, 2 Idols of Life, 5 Gold Scarabs and 5 Clay Scarabs to Kandrostrasz inside Ahn'Qiraj. You must also attain Friendly reputation with the Brood of Nozdormu to complete this quest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you bring the components I require, $N?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Yes... the worm's skin will make for an excellent protective layer.  Combined with the strongest parts from the Qiraji we've destroyed on our way here, this should make for a formidable piece of armor.  May it aid you in facing the unspeakable horrors that await inside!</RewardText>
