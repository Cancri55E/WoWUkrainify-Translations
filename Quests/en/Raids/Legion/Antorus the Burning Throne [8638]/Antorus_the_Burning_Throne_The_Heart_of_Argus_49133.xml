  <Title>Antorus, the Burning Throne: The Heart of Argus</Title>
  <Description>Hatuun tells me that after Argus fell, Sargeras ordered a temple of darkness to be built deep within the planet's core. Little is known of it, for only the titan's most devoted acolytes are given sigils that permit entrance.

If we lay claim to these sigils, they could be infused into the Vindicaar. This would allow our forces to stage a direct assault upon the fetid heart of Argus.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 4 Sigils of the Dark Titan from Aggramar in Antorus, the Burning Throne on Normal Difficulty.</LogDescription>
