  <Title>Blood of a Titan</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Before your eyes, a trickle of blood from the fallen titan Argus congeals into a flawless gemstone. Holding it in your palm, you sense an almost unfathomable power emanating from within... along with echoes of pain and sorrow.

It is the last remnant of a battle that should not have been winnable. An impossible achievement. Yet, as with all victories, this one came at tremendous cost.

You realize immediately to whom you must convey this prize.&gt;</Description>
