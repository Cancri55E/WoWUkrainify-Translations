  <Title>Trial of Valor: The Lost Army</Title>
  <Description>While Helya's defeat is your primary objective, I require more of your aid. Helya has gained the ability to steal and corrupt the souls of my Valarjar. Her minions hold these souls, corrupting them. I am certain Helya herself hordes the greatest Valarjar souls to herself. You must recover these lost souls, then return them to me.

Do this and I will reward you with blessed guard from the hall's armory.</Description>
