  <Title>Sigil of the Black Hand</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Goraluk sighs with... relief? ...or perhaps regret?&gt;$B$BOnce I walked these halls with pride, holding my head high as an orc of the Blackrock clan. But this is a wrong path. Our hammers were meant to craft axes, swords... not these machines from the stranger's whispers.$B$BThe Warlord will not be swayed, but by force. If you can retrieve essences from the Foundry's most powerful guardians, I can craft for you a sigil that will permit direct access to Blackhand's Crucible.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 4 Embers of the Mountain, 4 Hearts of Stone, and 4 Shards of Iron from the final bosses of each wing of the Blackrock Foundry on Normal difficulty.</LogDescription>
