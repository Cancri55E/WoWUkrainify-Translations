  <Title>Well of Souls</Title>
  <Description>As you defeat Gul'dan's minions, his hold over this fel citadel weakens, allowing me to teleport you and your allies deeper into the dark halls. If I only I had some Soul Remnants - four of them, let's say - none of this would be necessary, and I could harness that power to send you directly into the upper reaches of the Citadel.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 4 Soul Remnants from Gorefiend in Hellfire Citadel on Mythic difficulty.</LogDescription>
