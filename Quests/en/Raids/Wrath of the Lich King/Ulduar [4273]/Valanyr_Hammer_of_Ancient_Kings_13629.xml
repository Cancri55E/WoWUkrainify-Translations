  <Title>Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings</Title>
  <Description>The Archivum Console has hinted at a possible way to rebind the fragments of Val'anyr:  you must get the fragments inside the physical form of the being known as Yogg-Saron.$B$BIt sounds like a long shot, but for an artifact of such power you think the risk might just be worth it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Throw the Shattered Pieces of Val'anyr into Yogg-Saron's maw while he's casting Deafening Roar and defeat Yogg-Saron and recover the Reforged Hammer of Ancient Kings.$B$BThis can only be completed in Heroic mode and only if at least one Ulduar Watcher is not assisting you.</LogDescription>
