His missive was brief, but it seems that there has been some sort of attack on the Ruby Sanctum beneath the Temple.$B$BPressing business here in Dalaran keeps me from attending to the matter personally, but I have heard word of your exploits in the Lich King's Citadel and you are doubtless up to the task -- perhaps you could assist Krasus in my stead?</Description>
