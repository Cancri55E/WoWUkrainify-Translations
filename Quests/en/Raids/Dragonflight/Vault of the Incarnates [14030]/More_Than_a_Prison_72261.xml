  <Title>More Than a Prison?</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The ancient artifact appears elemental in nature. Lillian Brightmoon in Valdrakken might be able to tell more.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Ancient Vault Artifact to Lillian Brightmoon.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The Incarnates were locked away in the Vault, but aside from that we know very little either about it or its prisoners.

Artifacts like this can shed light on their culture, their history, and... their power. Studying them could improve our odds in defeating the primalists. Bring me more of these I will reward you with supplies.

Oh, and I will pen a note to Caretaker Jakes reminding her of your continued assistance of the Dragonscale Expedition.</RewardText>
