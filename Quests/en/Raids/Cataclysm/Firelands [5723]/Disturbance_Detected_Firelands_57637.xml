  <Title>Disturbance Detected: Firelands</Title>
  <Description>You're early $n, I hadn't even sent for you yet.

Another temporal distubrance has flared up, this time in the Firelands. If Ragnaros hadn't been dealt with when he was, well, you've already seen one way the end time could turn out.

Some intricate time weaving is required to be sure you catch Ragnaros early, but still after whatever is causing the disturbance. Whoever is doing this isn't messing around any more.</Description>
