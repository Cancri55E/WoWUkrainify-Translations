  <Title>Leading Motives</Title>
  <Description>&lt;A small object catches your eye. It glitters with Progenitor magic--ancient, yet... strangely more refined.&gt;

&lt;Soft vibrations and tones are woven into the device in a repeating refrain that almost seems to be trying to... speak?&gt;

&lt;Firim would be very interested in this.&gt;</Description>

  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak to Firim in Exile's Hollow.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>By the First Ones... once again, you bring me the extraordinary. You say you found this when you defeated the Jailer? How curious.

It almost seems as if it's trying to... to communicate somehow. The implications alone are--ah! Forgive me for getting carried away. This will require more than simple research, I'm afraid. 

Please, take this in return. It was one of my first discoveries--I suspect you have more to gain from its mobility than I do. 

Thank you, my friend.</RewardText>
