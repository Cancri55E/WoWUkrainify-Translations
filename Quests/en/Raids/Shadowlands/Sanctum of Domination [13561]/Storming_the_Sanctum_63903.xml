  <Title>Storming the Sanctum</Title>
  <Description>The Jailer has seized the sigils of all four covenants. It is clear he means to escape the Maw and steal the Arbiter's sigil from Oribos.

We cannot allow this to happen.

Atop Torghast sits the Sanctum of Domination, the Jailer's seat of power. The time has come to enter this dark domain.

No doubt Sylvanas Windrunner will command the forces that will attempt to thwart us. We must defeat her... and save Anduin Wrynn from her grasp.

Gather your forces, $n. The Ebon Blade will stand with you.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>The Banshee Queen is key to the Jailer's plans. Find her... and stop her.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Defeat Sylvanas Windrunner in the Sanctum of Domination.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The Jailer has what he wanted... along with Anduin at his side.

Our only victory--if you can call it that--is that we have Sylvanas in custody.

I pray she possesses knowledge that can give us an edge to stop whatever the Jailer is planning next.</RewardText>
