  <Title>Disturbance Detected: Black Temple</Title>
  <Description>$n, right on time, as always.

Good news first, because they're happening at the same time for me anyway. Thanks to the various timewarped objects past and future you discovered, we've figured out how to detect when a new one turns up.  

The bad news is, we know our technique works because something has changed in the Black Temple, and it's wreaking havoc across the timescape! We need you to ensure the fateful raid turns out exactly like it did before, and to remove the source of this disturbance.</Description>
