  <Description>Illidan's attention is now on Kael'thas, thanks to you.  The time has come to make our move.$B$BI've had a vision of an artifact that will aid us in our final struggle - the phylactery of a lich known as Winterchill.  Unfortunately its power was lost forever after his defeat in the Battle of Mount Hyjal.$B$BThere might be a way to retrieve this artifact, however.  Legend speaks of a place in Azeroth guarded by bronze dragons...  a place where past and present meet.  It is there you will find what we seek.</Description>

  <RewardText>My vision... it all becomes clear now.  The powers this artifact has over a soul.... to contain it... to siphon it into itself... I will use those powers to reclaim what belongs to me!  The time has arrived for us to take the fight to Illidan!</RewardText>
