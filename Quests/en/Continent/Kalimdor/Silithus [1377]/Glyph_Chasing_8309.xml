  <Title>Glyph Chasing</Title>
  <Description>After our initial foray into the hives and Mistress Mar'alith's subsequent madness the three hives have been spewing out bugs! The increased activity might be tied into the glyphs covering those strange crystals.$B$BIf I can get rubbings of those crystals and the glyphs on them, we might be able to make sense of this madness.$B$BTake this transcription set  and hit Hive'Regal to the east, $n. That's the last rubbing I need!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Geologist's Transcription Kit to make a Hive'Regal Rubbing from the Hive'Regal Glyphed Crystal.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>If you find some crazy night elf lass in there, be sure to give her a kick in the duff.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I can't make heads or tails of these glyphs. I've never seen anything like it! I hope Frankal's research can shed some light on this mess.</RewardText>
