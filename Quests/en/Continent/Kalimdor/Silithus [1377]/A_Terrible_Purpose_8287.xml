  <Title>A Terrible Purpose</Title>
  <Description>Ok, here we are... a pretty valuable chunk of information, I must say!  I've seen the Cenarion Circle forces arrive at Silithus.  They plan to drive the Twilight's Hammer out, don't they?  This will help.  $B$BTake this parchment to their leader, Commander Mar'alith.  Soon the Twilight's Hammer will be vanquished and I will be outside their grasp for good!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take the Decoded Tablet Parchment to Commander Mar'alith.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What is this you bring to me, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is very interesting information indeed, $n.  This sheds some light on the presence of the Twilight's Hammer in Silithus and will undoubtedly help us in our struggle against them.  Your efforts will be handsomely rewarded, $c.</RewardText>
