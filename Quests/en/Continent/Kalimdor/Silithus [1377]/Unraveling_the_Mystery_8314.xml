  <Title>Unraveling the Mystery</Title>
  <Description>We're on the verge of a breakthrough, $n! The rubbings you recovered have allowed us to recreate the glyphs on this crystalline prism. They are apparently a means for the Qiraji and other unknown entities to communicate various messages to the silithid.$B$BUnfortunately, that is all we could get out of the glyphs. We need to find a way to unlock the messages hidden within the crystals.$B$BTake the glyphed crystal prism to Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold.  She might be able to help.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver the Glyphed Crystal Prism to Geologist Larksbane at the Cenarion Hold in Silithus.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Oh my! What do you have there, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The reason the dwarves could not decipher the glyphs is because there is nothing to decipher. The shifting outer layer of the prism must properly align with the inner crystal's markings in order for the message to be transmitted. Clever...$B$BWhile we should be able to translate this data, we must first unlock the code. There is only one clue on the surface of the prism - assuming the rubbings were transferred correctly - and it looks grim.</RewardText>
