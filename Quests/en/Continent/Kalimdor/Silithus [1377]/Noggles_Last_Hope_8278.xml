  <Title>Noggle's Last Hope</Title>
  <Description>Blasted!  The antidote didn't work.  Noggle must've been stung by one of the stronger creatures in the far south.$B$BI'm going to need you to go there and get me some more samples, $n.  The good news is that since their poison is stronger I won't require as many.  The bad news is that there are more kinds of poisonous creatures crawling around the southern area so you'll have to draw from more sources.</Description>
