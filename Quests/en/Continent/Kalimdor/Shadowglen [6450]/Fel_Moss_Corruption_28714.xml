  <Title>Fel Moss Corruption</Title>
  <Description>You seem to know what you're doing. Perhaps I can task you with something a little more important.$B$BAs you may well know, the corruption in Teldrassil was supposedly wiped away. Yet something lingers. The creatures have not calmed and all manner of problems still plague us.$B$BI need you to deal with the grellkin that have gathered to the west, and while you're there, I want you to search them for fel moss. This will help me determine from where this continuing corruption stems.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 6 Fel Moss from the grellkin to the west of Ilthalaine.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Satisfy my suspicions, $N. Bring to me fel moss from the grellkin.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Your service to the creatures of Shadowglen is worthy of reward, $n.$b$bYou confirmed my fears, however. The grellkin are still tainted by fel moss, despite Teldrassil's blessing. Something sinister remains within the tree. I can only hope that the Gnarlpine tribe of furbolgs are free of the corruption, or we are still in grave danger.$b$bI will look into this further and contact those who might be of aid. Thank you, $c.</RewardText>
