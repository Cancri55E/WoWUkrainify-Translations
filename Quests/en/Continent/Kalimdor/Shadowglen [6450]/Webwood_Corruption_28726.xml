  <Title>Webwood Corruption</Title>
  <Description>I'd hoped to never return to Teldrassil for such grim business. I'd hoped that its corruption had been wiped away completely.  Something foul lingers.$B$BThese spiders suffer much more deeply from the corruption than the other nearby wildlife. They are becoming a danger to your people and a danger to the forest. We must thin their numbers, but more importantly, we need to find the source of the corruption that plagues them.$B$BI will come with you and aid you in this. </Description>
