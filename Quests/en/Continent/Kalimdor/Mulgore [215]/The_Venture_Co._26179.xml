  <Title>The Venture Co.</Title>
  <Description>This explains the buildup of Venture Co. employees and equipment we've seen in Mulgore. Those goblins... their company is expanding too quickly for their own good. It's how they say, show a goblin something, and you can hear the scales in the background.$b$bGreedy little things, they are. Unfortunately for their business enterprise, we tauren cannot allow them to conduct their operations in our lands. Go to their mine northeast of the ravaged caravan and send them a message.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 7 Venture Co. Workers for Morin Cloudstalker at Bloodhoof Village.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I don't think there could be too much misinterpreting or ignoring of that signal, hm? The Venture Co. will know not to take the tauren lightly, or to be so arrogant as to believe we would allow them to steal the natural resources around us without protest.</RewardText>
