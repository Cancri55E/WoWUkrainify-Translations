  <Title>Sharing the Land</Title>
  <Description>$n, there are many conflicts that wound this land. It is my hope that you will not bear witness to as many of them as our elders have. Yet there is one that I would ask you to seek. It will give you some sense of how terrible, if left unchecked, even a small threat can be to the land.$B$BPalemane gnolls have settled to the south of Bloodhoof and in a cave to the west. They disrespect our attempts to communicate with them, and they slay the wildlife of Mulgore unbridled.$B$BWords are no longer the answer.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 15 Palemane Gnolls then return to Ahmo Thunderhorn in Bloodhoof Village.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>$n, it is good you've taken the task seriously. Respect of the land and its creatures is important. Death and life are a circle... a necessity. One cannot exist without the other. Take time to ponder this and do well to never forget it.</RewardText>
