  <Title>Finding Your Way</Title>
  <Description>Orgrimmar's a big city. Way too big to explore on foot. Warlord Grimaxe has arranged for you to receive a mount to help you get around.

She said to speak with Rohaka at the stables... but I can't seem to remember the way there.

Don't worry, $n! All we need to do is ask a guard for directions. If you ever need help finding something, the city guards will show you where to go.

Let's ask a nearby guard for directions to the stable master. Then we can be on our way!</Description>
