  <Title>A Primal Threat</Title>
  <Description>Raszageth has wasted no time building up her Primalist forces.

The Kirin Tor have detected massive storms being unleashed at key points across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms.

The Primalists are unleashing the elements to add to their strength. It seems they plan to cause chaos not only in the Dragon Isles, but in the lands of the Alliance and Horde as well.

Seek out the enemy and study their methods. We have to stop them before it's too late.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather $1oa Motes of Primal Energy from enemies in active primal storm locations throughout Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It is good you thwarted their attack, at least for now.

&lt;Khadgar examines the motes you brought him.&gt;

Hmm, primal elemental energy. I will take this for further study.</RewardText>
