  <Title>Home Is Where the Hearth Is</Title>
  <Description>I don't know about you, but I'm in the mood for some good ol' fashioned recreation!

Why don't we head over to The Wyvern's Tail and cool off with a few pints of Cobo Cola?

While we're there, speak with Innkeeper Nufa to make The Wyvern's Tail your new home. That way, if you ever find yourself stranded without a flight master nearby, you can use your hearthstone to return to the inn.

Not only is it faster than a wyvern, but you'll save yourself some dough in the process!</Description>
