  <Title>Meeting the Orcs</Title>
  <Description>I haven't lost any love for my homeland or its people, as you know. I've fought tooth and nail for Silvermoon to be allowed a place beside Undercity and Orgrimmar at the negotiating table.$B$BThis should silence any opposition. Take this letter to Saurfang in Orgrimmar. As leader of the orcs, he must have a say in accepting the sin'dorei's pledge.$B$BI've added my own seal to the letter as a personal endorsement. Go northwest of the city and board the zeppelin bound for Durotar at the tower.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Lady Sylvanas Windrunner wants you to take the Letter Sealed by Sylvanas to High Overlord Saurfang in Orgrimmar, capital of Durotar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Yes, $C?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Thrall begins to read the letter.&gt;$b$bSo the blood elves finally took care of their little problem. It is no surprise that it took your help as well as that of an entire Forsaken regiment to get the job done.$b$b&lt;The Warchief breaks into laughter.&gt;$b$bI suppose there's no stopping this. In the end we need them just as much as they need us.</RewardText>
