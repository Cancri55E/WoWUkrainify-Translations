  <Title>The Lord Admiral's Lament</Title>
  <Description>The footlocker contains a number of Lord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore's personal effects. Among them is a rolled letter, sealed with sea-green wax and stamped with the Proudmoore crest. The parchment tears easily and requires careful handling and it appears that the ink has been largely washed away by tide and time.

Perhaps someone can restore the letter and reveal its contents.</Description>
