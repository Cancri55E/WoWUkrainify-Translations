  <CompletionText>What is this, goblin? You are not from these parts.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is from Thrall?

&lt;Saurfang rubs his chin in thought.&gt;

I understand the meaning of this clearly.

There are other goblins that are working in Azshara that you could visit and get your bearings. &lt;Saurfang points to Gobber.&gt; We found this one wandering the city and he seems to recognize you. He might want to go with you.

From this day on, you and the Bilgewater Cartel are one with the Horde!</RewardText>
