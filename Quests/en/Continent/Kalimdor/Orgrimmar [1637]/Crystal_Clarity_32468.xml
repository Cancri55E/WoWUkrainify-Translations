  <Description>You know, there is a way we can improve your S.E.L.F.I.E. cam, if you're interested. With the right focusing lens, I could add all kinds of features to that thing.

I've heard that way out on old Yojamba Isle in Stranglethorn Vale, the mother of all basilisks has been seen. Her hide is dotted with gems that'd make the perfect lens, if I could get my hands on them.

She's not going to go down easy, though. You might want to bring some friends along.</Description>
