  <Title>Welcome to Orgrimmar</Title>
  <Description>The warchief will be waiting for our mission report from Exile's Reach. I must deliver it at once.

For now, Cork Fizzlepop will show you around the city. Orgrimmar has much to offer, so explore it as you see fit.

I'll send for you once I've given my report to the warchief.</Description>
