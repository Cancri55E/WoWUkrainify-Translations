  <Title>Traitor's Bait</Title>
  <Description>The Twilight's Hammer agents still lurk within the confines of Orgrimmar. I need someone I trust to collect the final evidence of treachery.

&lt;Eitrigg pulls you aside.&gt;

I suspect that Sauranok the Mystic is involved. I need you to uncover the truth, $n.  The Twilight's Hammer has placed their agents within the ranks of the workers at the airship docks to spread their lies across the land. Speak with them. If you find evidence of Sauranok's guilt then show him what happens to traitors of the Horde.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Question Orgrimmar Skyway Peons around the Zeppelin Towers. Look for any Suspicious Peons. Try to flush out Sauranok the Mystic and kill him.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It is good to see you, $c. How goes the search?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah Sauranok, his visions worked against him. The Twilight's Hammer probably corrupted him.$B$BI must be honest with you, I told him you were looking around the docks. Yes, you were used for bait but you were successful. You are serving the Horde well and deserve a reward for plucking this viper from our home.</RewardText>
