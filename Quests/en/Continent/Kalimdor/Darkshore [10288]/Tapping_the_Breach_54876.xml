  <Title>Tapping the Breach</Title>
  <Description>We had thought the Twilight's Hammer's presence in Darkshore was snuffed out with the defeat of Deathwing. Apparently, we were mistaken.

Remnants of their cult have used the conflict in Darkshore as an opportunity to re-establish their presence here. Darkshore is home to several breaches of elemental power, and it looks like they aim to use these to unleash powerful elementals to devastate the land.

This must not stand.</Description>
