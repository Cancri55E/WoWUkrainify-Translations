  <Description>Some nefarious no-goodnik is tampering with my Buzzboxes!

I've been trying to get the Buzzbox network back online since we were able to drive the Horde out of Darkshore, but I'm getting no reading from boxes 456, 627, 111, and 854!  I'd be willing to bet that some stragglers from the Bilgewater Cartel are to blame!

See if you can get those Buzzboxes back online, will you? We'll need their readings if we ever want to permanently fix the corruption problem here.</Description>
