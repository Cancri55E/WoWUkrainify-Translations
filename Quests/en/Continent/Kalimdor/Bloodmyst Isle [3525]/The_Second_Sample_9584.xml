  <Title>The Second Sample</Title>
  <Description>Now that we have the baseline crystal, we're going to need samples from more dangerous areas of the island to complete the set I'll be sending to the Exodar.$B$BThe next sample must come from the crystals controlled by the blood elves in the Bladewood area to the northwest of Blood Watch. I have heard reports that they alter and harvest the crystals for use in some magical apparatus. See if you can find one that has not yet been incorporated into one of their devices, and mine a sample from it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Get an Altered Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Altered Bloodmyst Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the second crystal sample?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Harbinger Mikolaas examines the crystal shard.&gt;$B$BThis shard is much different from the initial sample.$B$B&lt;Harbinger Mikolaas holds the crystal up to catch the light.&gt;$B$BDo you see how it pulsates like that? That's worrisome. I'll make a note in my report of the alterations the blood elves appear to have made to this crystal. Thank you again for your help, $n.</RewardText>
