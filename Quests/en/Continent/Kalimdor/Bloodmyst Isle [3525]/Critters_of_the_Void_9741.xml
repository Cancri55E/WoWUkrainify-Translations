  <Title>Critters of the Void</Title>
  <Description>Aesom sent my squad out on a reconnaissance mission to search for the sun gate a few days ago. Needless to say, we found it...$B$B&lt;Loryi points at Jorli.&gt;$B$BWhatever those fool elves are transporting through that portal is causing void energy to be released. The area is teaming with void critters. $B$BWe must destroy them before they have a chance to grow into void anomalies. You'll find the source of the creatures southwest of here, near the sun gate. Kill them and report back to Aesom when you're done.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 12 Void Critters and report to Vindicator Aesom at Blood Watch.
</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Void critters grow into void anomalies. Truth be told, we really don't know what these creatures are... the name is more of a classification.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It's a real mess up there, eh? You've done well, $n. I'll send some anchorites out to help Loryi and Jorli.
