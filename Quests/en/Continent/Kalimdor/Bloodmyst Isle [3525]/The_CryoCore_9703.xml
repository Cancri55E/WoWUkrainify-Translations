  <Title>The Cryo-Core</Title>
  <Description>We have others pursuing leads on the sun portals, $n. I need you to focus on the task at hand.$B$BBoros has received new reports of another crash site. What we've since discovered is that the crash site is actually the Exodar's cryo-core. This is a pod holding area that houses pods exactly like the ones we draenei crawled out of in Ammen Vale.$B$BThis area also holds medical supplies. Head to the Cryo-Core, directly west of Blood Watch. Search for supplies and search for survivors.

  <LogDescription>Vindicator Kuros at Blood Watch wants you to recover 12 boxes of Medical Supplies.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Was the information accurate?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Just blood elves? No survivors? This is troubling. I'll need some time to think this through, $n. Perhaps Aesom or Boros have an assignment for you to complete.</RewardText>
