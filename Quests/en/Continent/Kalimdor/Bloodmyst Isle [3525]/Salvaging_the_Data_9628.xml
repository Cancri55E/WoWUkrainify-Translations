  <Title>Salvaging the Data</Title>
  <Description>It's too late to assist the cartographers in completing their mission, but it appears they collected the data Harbinger Mikolaas was expecting.

I'm grateful for your help in locating the team and recovering the crystal.$B$B&lt;The harbinger's fists clench.&gt;$B$BWe've lost too many good men already, and our mission has only just begun.</RewardText>
