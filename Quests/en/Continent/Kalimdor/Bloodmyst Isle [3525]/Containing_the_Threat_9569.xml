  <Title>Containing the Threat</Title>
  <Description>Now that we have made our presence known to the satyr, we must send a message that we will not tolerate the Burning Legion's hounds in these lands.$B$BToo long have the draenei fled in the wake of the Legion and its minions, $n. Wherever they have found us, they have shown no mercy.$B$BWe must not permit the satyr to exploit the Exodar's crash and use the corrupted crystals as weapons. Go north to where their leader resides in Axxarien, destroy him, and recover the corrupted crystals he has been gathering!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 5 Axxarien Shadowstalkers, 5 Axxarien Hellcallers, and Zevrax, then gather 5 Corrupted Crystals and return to Vindicator Aalesia in Blood Watch.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Vindicator Aalesia seems to look through you rather than at you, her mind fixed on dealing with the satyr.&gt;$B$BHave you moved against the satyr leader as I have asked?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Without their leader, and with the recovery of the corrupted crystals underway, we can safely keep the satyr in check. Light knows how many more of these wretched creatures are out there.$B$BHarbinger Mikolaas and I are grateful for the help you've provided in dealing with the satyr before they could become a larger threat. Your work stands as a reminder that vigilance is the key to victory against the Legion and its minions.</RewardText>
