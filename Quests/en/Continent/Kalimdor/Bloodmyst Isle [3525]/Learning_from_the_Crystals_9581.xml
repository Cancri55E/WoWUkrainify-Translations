  <Title>Learning from the Crystals</Title>
  <Description>Welcome to Blood Watch, $c. Seeing to the defenses of the outpost is my primary concern, but I've also been tasked with a variety of other duties by our leaders at the Exodar.$B$BThe problem is that it's hardly safe to send out large amounts of researchers when the island is this dangerous. I need someone to gather a series of crystal samples from various sites on the island.$B$BThe first sample I need must come from the ravager infested ship debris south of the town and across the bridge.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Get an Impact Site Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Impact Site Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to gather the first crystal sample?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This crystal shard will give our researchers a baseline to compare against samples from other parts of the island, since it comes from one of Bloodmyst's less corrupted regions.$B$BI won't be able to send it off until we have a full set of samples, but this is a great start. If you're willing to help gather the other samples, I'll see to it that you're rewarded for your efforts.</RewardText>
