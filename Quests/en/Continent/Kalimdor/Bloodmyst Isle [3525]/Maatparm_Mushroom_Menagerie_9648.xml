  <Title>Maatparm Mushroom Menagerie</Title>
  <Description>Did you know mushroom hunting is far more dangerous than mushroom consumption? Mushroom hunters expose themselves to many unknowns - not including potential wildlife dangers!$B$BWhat would life be without a little danger? I am in need of mushrooms for my collection. Scattered throughout these unexplored wilds you will find four different types: An aquatic stinkhorn, a blood mushroom, a ruinous polyspore, and a fel cone fungus. They are each unique to various regions in Bloodmyst. Bring them to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Maatparm at Blood Watch wants 1 Aquatic Stinkhorn, 1 Blood Mushroom, 1 Ruinous Polyspore, and 1 Fel Cone Fungus.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Remember, the mushrooms I requested are each unique to the different environments of Bloodmyst.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, I did warn you - did I not? Hopefully this payment more than makes up for the mild discomfort that you may have suffered. Return to me when you have gained strength and perhaps I will have another job for you - mushrooms of course!</RewardText>
