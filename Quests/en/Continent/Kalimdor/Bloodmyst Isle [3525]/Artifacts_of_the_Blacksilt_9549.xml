  <Title>Artifacts of the Blacksilt</Title>
  <Description>My observations and writings about the Blacksilt murlocs are quite illuminating, $n, but they are just the beginning. I plan to return to Ironforge with items produced by the Blacksilts' rudimentary crafting skills.$B$BThe problem is that the Blacksilt carry these items with them at all times, and I can't have their blood on my conscience. If you're willing to help me gather the idols carried by Blacksilt seers and crude knives of the Blacksilt warriors and shorestrikers, I won't ask how you came by them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 3 Crude Murloc Idols and 6 Crude Murloc Knives to Clopper Wizbang, who is hiding in a beached turtle shell.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have those samples for me to send back to Ironforge?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Astounding, simply astounding! These are perfect, $n. I can already see them under the glass in the museum in Ironforge. The text for the display is virtually writing itself in my head!$B$BYour help has been invaluable in getting my studies back on track. How do you spell your name? I'll make sure it appears in my report as co-author.$B$BOne of the chaps on the ship gave me this 'treasure map' to cover a gambling debt, but mythology isn't my area of study. Superstitious lot, sailors. </RewardText>
