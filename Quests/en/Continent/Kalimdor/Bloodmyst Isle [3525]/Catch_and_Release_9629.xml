  <Description>The Blacksilt murlocs on the southwestern coast are curious creatures. In some ways, they act barely sentient, yet in others, they show a remarkable degree of organization.$B$BI have a few theories about that, but no real way to test them until recently. I've devised a method that will allow me to track the murlocs I'm interested in without doing any lasting harm or interfering with their natural behavior. If you're willing to help with the marking, I'll gladly pay you for your assistance.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Morae at Blood Watch wants you to 'mark' 6 Blacksilt Scouts using the Murloc Tagger. </LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did the device work? Have you marked the murlocs for my research?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n. I was worried that the marking device might malfunction, but it seems like everything went according to plan.</RewardText>
