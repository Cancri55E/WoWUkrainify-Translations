  <Title>Signs of the Legion</Title>
  <Description>The armor scrap is forged from a deep black metal that seems to absorb light. Although it doesn't appear to be enchanted, there is an unmistakable sense of wrongness about it.$B$BSuch armor is only used by one force - the Burning Legion. The Legion's presence here can only mean that they're intending to mobilize the island's satyr against the draenei.$B$BTake action against the local satyr, then return to Blood Watch and show this armor scrap to Vindicator Aalesia. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 Nazzivus Satyr and 8 Nazzivus Felsworn, then bring Tzerak's Armor Plate to Vindicator Aalesia in Blood Watch.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Yes, $c? What is it you have there?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You've done well in bringing this to me, $n. This is, without a doubt, an armor fragment from a felguard.$B$BThen, it is as I feared. The Nazzivus satyr are renewing their contacts with the Burning Legion. If we don't stop them, the satyrs and their demonic allies will overrun us. I will notify Harbinger Mikolaas right away.</RewardText>
