  <Title>Alien Predators</Title>
  <Description>One thing we've learned in our travels is that extreme care must be taken when introducing wildlife from one world to another. When the Exodar crashed, it was carrying specimens of various Outland species, including an insectoid predator called the ravager.$B$BSome of the specimens were lost, but many others survived and took to the wild. If we don't keep them in check, they will upset the natural balance here on the islands.$b$bYou'll find these ravagers to the west of Kessel's Crossing, near the coast.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Bloodmyst Hatchlings then return to Vorkhan the Elekk Herder at Kessel's Crossing on Bloodmyst Isle.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We must act before the ravager displaces Bloodmyst Isle's native predators. Have you begun culling the ravager population?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n. The ravager population will bear watching for some time to come, but we've made a good start.</RewardText>
