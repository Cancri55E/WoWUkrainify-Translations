  <Title>The Final Sample</Title>
  <Description>There's just one sample remaining before I can send this set of crystals to the Exodar, $n. The final sample must come from the satyr stronghold of Axxarien to the northwest.$B$BI'm not certain what to expect from this crystal sample, but I'm sure there will be some signs of corruption. Take care to mine your shard from the crystal that looks like the ones you took your previous samples from, or else our researchers cannot make a valid comparison.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Get an Axxarian Crystal Sample using the Crystal Mining Pick on the Axxarien Crystal and bring it to Harbinger Mikolaas in Blood Watch.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you returned with the last sample for my set?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Harbinger Mikolaas accepts the last crystal from you.&gt;$B$BThat rounds out the set. All that remains to be done is to box them and send them to the Exodar.$B$B&lt;The harbinger seems glad to be done with the task.&gt;$B$BDon't get me wrong, $n, I'm sure the research is valuable, but we're faced with a number of other pressing problems out here. </RewardText>
