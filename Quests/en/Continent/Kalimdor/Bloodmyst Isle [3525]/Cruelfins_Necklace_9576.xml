  <Title>Cruelfin's Necklace</Title>
  <Description>Examining the crudely constructed pendant, you notice the crystal pulsating softly. Though it emits little light, you can almost feel the crystal radiating a sense of wrongness.$B$BYou're not quite sure what might have possessed Cruelfin to create this pendant, but the find is too important to ignore. You should probably show it to someone at Blood Watch.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Red Crystal Pendant to Morae at Blood Watch.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What is it you have there?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is most curious, $c. I don't believe we've ever seen the murlocs wearing any kind of adornment before.$B$BGiven the corrupting influence that the crystal shards are known to have, the murloc that wore this pendant must have believed it granted him power over his fellows. I wouldn't be surprised if he had rapidly outgrown his fellow murlocs and gained in strength.</RewardText>
