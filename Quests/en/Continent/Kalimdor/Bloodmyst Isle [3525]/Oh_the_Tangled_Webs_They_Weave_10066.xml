  <Title>Oh, the Tangled Webs They Weave</Title>
  <Description>We don't dare abandon our post, or wander too far from Vindicator's Rest, $r. The mutated creatures closest to the Vector Coil have been changed profoundly by energy leaking from the crystals.$B$BThe mutated tanglers appear to have gained a certain degree of sentience. They've learned to create, set, and conceal vicious traps that can ensnare even the most careful warrior.$B$BWe'll never be able to move against the Sunhawks if we're constantly forced to look underfoot. Attack the problem at its source, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 Mutated Tanglers and report to Vindicator Corin at Vindicator's Rest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you managed to clear any of the mutated tanglers?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n. It's going to be much easier to get reinforcements from Blood Watch, or launch strikes against the Sunhawks without having to worry about what the tanglers are up to.</RewardText>
