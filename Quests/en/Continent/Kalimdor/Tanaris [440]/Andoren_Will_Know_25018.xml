  <Title>Andoren Will Know</Title>
  <Description>Listen carefully, $n. I don't know how those ogres got ahold of it, but that thing's a titan artifact. I'm no expert, but just that fact alone makes it probably older than the sand we're standing on.$B$BI also know that things like this are nothing but trouble. I don't want anything to do with it. Take it south, to the Valley of the Watchers, and give it to a blood elf named Andoren Dawnrise there. And don't ask any questions, babe, please.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver the artifact to Andoren Dawnrise at the Valley of the Watchers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Of all the...you found this in an ogre den? Unthinkable. I'm amazed they didn't try to smash it to pieces.$B$BWith any luck, $c, we'll be able to obtain even more fascinating antiquities here...if you're willing to help.</RewardText>
