  <Title>Butcherbot</Title>
  <Description>I make my money around here selling animal parts. I've been perfecting a foolproof method of maximizing profit: The butcherbot!$B$BThese little guys are programmed to harvest every scrap of usable material from the wildlife around here, on a case-by-case basis. He does all the work, and best of all, only I know how to get the goods back out of him.$B$BIf you're interested in making some coin, take one of these guys for a spin. I need some glasshide basilisk parts; you'll find a bunch of them to the south.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Butcherbot to harvest 10 Glasshide Basilisk corpses.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You'll need to fill the little bot's hopper up completely.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Nice going, kid. Didn't lose any fingers? Good, we can get some more work for you then.</RewardText>
