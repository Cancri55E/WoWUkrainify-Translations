  <Title>Find OOX-17/TN!</Title>
  <Description>You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.$B$B"The name's Oglethorpe, and my homing robot has gone missing!  I will reward you for its recovery!  Please take this beacon to the robot.  Excellent, I now have computed the coordinates for you!  It crashed near the Gaping Chasm in Tanaris!"</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the distress beacon to Oglethorpe's homing robot.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You appear to have uncovered the wreckage of... a robotic chicken?  The voice from within the egg crackles to life again:$B$B"Yes, excellent work!  This is indeed my homing robot, though my sensors indicate that it needs a jump start before it can fly back to Booty Bay for repairs.  Go ahead and place the beacon inside the rover.  The beacon will take care of the rest!"</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You place the egg... distress beacon... inside the chicken... homing robot.$B$BHums and whirs are heard from inside the robot as it struggles to stand up.  After the robot comes to life, Oglethorpe's voice is heard once more, but now from inside the robot:$B$B"OOX-17/TN is working at least, but it needs major repairs!  It is much too heavy for you to carry it... but I think I have an idea.  Are you up for watching over it some more?"</RewardText>
