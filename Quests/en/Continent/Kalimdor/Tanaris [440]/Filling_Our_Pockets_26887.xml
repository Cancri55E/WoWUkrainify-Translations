  <Title>Filling Our Pockets</Title>
  <Description>I know we're here to make friends with the Steamwheedle goblins, but those awful Bilgewater goblins are so rude.$B$BWhy, I just saw a bunch of them pulling gold fillings out of the teeth of the Southsea musketeers and strongarms. Do they think they can just take that for themselves?$B$BObviously, the nice thing to do is kill those pirates ourselves, take their fillings, and then give some of them to the Steamwheedle as a thank-you gift! Head on down there and beat those goblins to the punch.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 20 Gold Fillings from Southsea Musketeers or Southsea Strongarms.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you got the fillings?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>More gold! We'll be sure to give some of this to Mister Noggenfogger to smoothly ensure our continued relations.$B$BAnd only a little bit of it will go back to Gnomeregan for experimental weapons development!</RewardText>
