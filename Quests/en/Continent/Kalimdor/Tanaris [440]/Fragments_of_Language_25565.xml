  <Description>We've had our first big find in years here at the Southmoon ruins. My lads have dug up stone tablets, engraved with ancient writings.$B$BThe glyphs on the tablets are like nothing we've ever seen, but I have a hunch we can connect them with titanic scripts found at other digsites. Imagine what a breakthrough like that could mean!$B$B I need you to go to the Southmoon ruins and help us collect the tablets; the other lads can't leave, lest the blood elves take our site!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 5 Ancient Hieroglyphs.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the tablets?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Would you take a look at these...not troll, not qiraji, just pure mystery waiting to be unlocked.$B$BThese aren't going anywhere now that they're safely in our hands. It's time to make our way into the ruins!</RewardText>
