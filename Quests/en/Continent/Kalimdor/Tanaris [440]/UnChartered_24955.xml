  <Title>Un-Chartered</Title>
  <Description>As I may have mentioned, I'm trying to get these Dunemaul ogres to join the Horde..and  work for the Bilgewater Cartel as cheap local labor.$B$BTo pull this off, we've gotta pay lip service to the actual initiation process and all that, or I'm going to catch flak later on. So I've gotten this charter drawn up, and slapped the initiation rites onto our own limited time offer labor stipulation contract.$B$BI've got a disguise for you here, so suit up and get all these signatures filled out.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 10 Charter Signatures from Dunemaul Ogres.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Babe, there's still blank spots on this sheet. Being near ogres isn't rubbing off on your intelligence, I hope.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Wow, nice work! I'm amazed you even got them to hold a pen without eating it.$B$BYou can uh, just throw the suit over there. Away from me. In the fire.</RewardText>
