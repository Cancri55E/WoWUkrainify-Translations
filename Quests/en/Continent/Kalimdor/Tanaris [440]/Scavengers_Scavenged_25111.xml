  <Title>Scavengers Scavenged</Title>
  <Description>Now that I know you're not squeamish, I've got another job for you. Have you seen the red-feathered birds swarming around the bones out there? Those are fire rocs. They'll light you up good if you're not careful.$B$BThey're also pretty darn valuable thanks to their unique anatomy. Most of the hunters loafing around here aren't up to the task of killing fire-spitting buzzards for money... think you can handle it?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Butcherbot to harvest 12 Fire Roc corpses.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Are you done? I don't want fire roc gizzards left sitting in Butcherbot's tank for too long, it's harsh on the machinery.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Alchemists pay through the nose for these things. Sure, maybe I tell some of them they're dragon parts, but that ain't my problem, right?</RewardText>
