  <Title>Terrapination</Title>
  <Description>We need to obtain the object described in this journal, for certain. Extracting it from a chest would be a feasible matter, but the object itself sounds compromised, and unstable. Attempting to forcefully open the chest could be disastrous.$B$BFortunately, we know where the key is...statistically speaking, at least. There's plenty of sea turtles at the east end of this beach. One of them may hold the key.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain a Turtle-Digested Key from a Surf Glider.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hopefully your spree of turtle destruction left it intact.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, gosh, this day just keeps getting better and better! I may actually smile.$B$BWhen you're not looking. You've seen enough of that already.</RewardText>
