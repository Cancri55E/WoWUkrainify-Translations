  <Title>Define "Crazy"</Title>
  <Description>We received reports that a goblin shipwreck occured on this beach some time ago, with the survivors left to fend for themselves. We expected there to be a modicum of survivors, perhaps some even suitable for interrogation.$B$BWhat we found was a crew of Bilgewater goblins who have all become insane, delusional, and maniacally violent...to further degrees than is normally observed, rather.$B$BIn short, they are useless and dangerous. Gnomeregan will be best served by cutting down as many as we can.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Crazed Survivors.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Your reports of their behavior are truly disturbing...but also slightly amusing.$B$BIf only that Dreadshredder wench had escaped on these vessels instead...</RewardText>
