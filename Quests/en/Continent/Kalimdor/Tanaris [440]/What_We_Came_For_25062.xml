  <Title>What We Came For</Title>
  <Description>Gnomeregan previously learned that the Bilgewater goblins of the Horde survived a crash on an uncharted island near Kalimdor before arriving in Durotar. We initially came here to investigate what techniques and technology could possibly allow a hopeless pack of imbeciles to survive such harsh conditions.$B$BWhile the goblins are at a loss, we still need to find out exactly what happened here. Search the beach for wreckage and belongings and bring anything that appears significant back to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search Bilgewater Footlockers for evidence.</LogDescription>
