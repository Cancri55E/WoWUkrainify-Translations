  <Title>Rocket Rescue</Title>
  <Description>When the water came in, Steamwheedle Port to the east was flooded, and a lot of poor goblins are still stuck there! Now those mean pirates are shooting at any boat that leaves the docks here.$B$BBut they won't expect us to fly! There's a hot air balloon by the docks. We can use that, fly over to rescue the goblins, and take care of the pirates, too. Mr. Noggenfogger will be so pleased!$B$BGo to the docks and hop in the balloon and I'll be right behind you, okay? I've got to get some rockets...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver Liferockets to 5 Steamwheedle Survivors and use bombs to kill 40 Southsea Blockaders.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That was great! It looks like most of the goblins we helped made it back here and didn't blow up. We really showed that goblin girl!$B$BHere's a special reward for you, $gmister:miss;.</RewardText>
