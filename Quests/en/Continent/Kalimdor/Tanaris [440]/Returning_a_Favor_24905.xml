I hadn't seen her in months, but she barely gave me the time of day, just wanted me to tell you she had more business lined up.$B$BShe said she was headed over to the Dunemaul Compound to set up shop, something about ogres. Since you're done here, might as well head over...I wouldn't keep a goblin like her waiting.</Description>
