  <Title>Dead Man's Chest</Title>
  <Description>Look, babe, you should be able to see what's happening here pretty easily. There's pirates, there's goblins, the goblins are fighting the pirates. There's some sad little gnomes trying to fight the pirates too.$B$BI'll make it nice and simple for you: we need to kill a lot of pirates. Go do that, 'kay? We don't want the gnomes killing more than us, after all.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 15 Southsea Freebooters of any kind.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Look, if you think the bare minimum is enough, then ok. But some people choose to kill more pirates and I encourage that, ok?$B$BAnd by "ok", I mean "go kill more and stop wasting my time".</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I'm pleased to report that our brand recognition in this area has skyrocketed now that you've killed most of the people who didn't want us here.</RewardText>
