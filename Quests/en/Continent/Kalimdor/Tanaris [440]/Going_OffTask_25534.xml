  <Title>Going Off-Task</Title>
  <Description>As you may have seen, the ship docked to the north has its cannons blazing. While it's pretty fun watching the gnomes run face-first into a hail of iron, my bruisers keep doing it too, and it's absolutely killing my overhead expenses.$B$BI'd like you to try and dance through the cannonfire, get on that ship, and kill the taskmaster leading the cannoneers. The rest of the crew is probably a bunch of spineless prats; once he's down, we should be good.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill the Southsea Taskmaster.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What's wrong? Scared of a few cannonballs?</CompletionText>
