  <Title>Chicken of the Desert</Title>
  <Description>I've got an idea, but we're going to need bait.$B$BThe other day I saw a rabid blisterpaw hyena wander too close to the edge of the chasm, and one of the silithid comes diving out of nowhere. Nearly swallowed it whole! Horrible sight.$B$BSo we're gonna need hyena meat, obviously. Go gather some, make sure it's fresh, and bring it back here. There should be plenty just north of the camp.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 6 pieces of Hyena Meat.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>This is fresh, right? They won't go after anything that's been withering in the sun.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Man, this stuff looks delicious. I'm half tempted to just fry some up myself.$B$BNo! We've gotta focus on gettin' out of here.$B$BMaybe just one piece...</RewardText>
