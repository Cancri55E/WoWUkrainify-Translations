  <Title>To The Ground!</Title>
  <Description>I've conducted a thorough appraisal of the real estate here and, unfortunately, its market value is just far too low to be of any use. We're going to have to renovate.$B$BLuckily for you, I've learned a few things about arson. Hopefully you have too! You're going to be throwing these perfectly safe bottles of flaming rum at those filthy ramshackle huts over there.$B$BTry not to stand downwind.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Set fire to the Northwest Shack, the Southeast Shack, and the Northeast Shack.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What part of "to the ground" don't you understand, $c?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Wonderful job. Have you ever thought about becoming a full-time arsonist? I know a few people, it's a nice gig.$B$BWell, we'll chit-chat about that one later. More to do here!</RewardText>
