  <Title>A Few Good Goblins</Title>
  <Description>We haven't just been camped here singin' songs with gnomes and playing with dangerous machinery, you know. My men have been trying to clear this hive out for a week now! Problem is, we've taken so many losses by now that the bugs have the advantage.$B$BLucky for us, the bugs either don't like to eat goblins, or they like us so much they save us as treats, because nearly all my men are still cocooned up out there. I need you to go save 'em.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Save 8 Captured Goblin Bughunters from Hazzali Cocoons.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>This camp is still feelin' pretty lonely. Mind savin' a few more?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thanks for the help, this was really killin' things here. Once you start losing men, you start losing manpower. And morale. And weapons. And the magazines you loaned to that one guy.$B$BYou know how it is.</RewardText>
