  <Description>At the Southmoon ruins, just east of here, we've made some finds. My colleagues have found stone shards, engraved with ancient writings, newly exposed by the shifting sands.$B$BThe writings are in no known tongue, though they bear resemblance to markings we've seen on other ruins of the titans. Deciphering them could reveal many more secrets.$B$BUnfortunately, my colleagues are also busy defending the tablets from the Alliance. I need you to go to the Southmoon ruins and retrieve the tablets yourself.</Description>
