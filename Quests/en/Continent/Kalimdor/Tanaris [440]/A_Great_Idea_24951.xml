  <Title>A Great Idea</Title>
  <Description>Now that we've got a good pile of fresh chunks, we just tie it to this rope...and now you're ready to go catch me a silithid.$B$BWhat? Don't give me that look, it's perfectly safe. Well, mostly safe. Okay, you might die painfully. But it'll be easy! Just throw this meat out there, wait for a bug to pounce on it, and then drag 'em back here by the rope!$B$BGo after one of the swarmers. I haven't seen the other ones go for hyenas before, and you should find plenty of swarmers around the edge of the pit.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Bootlegger Bug Bait to capture a Hazzali Swarmer.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I don't see any bug with you, pal.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Look at the size of it! It's glorious. This ugly sucker's gonna help us bring down the whole hive.</RewardText>
