  <Title>All Cheered Out</Title>
  <Description>Well gosh, we've cleaned up quite a bit here!$B$B&lt;Kelsey clears her throat.&gt;$B$BListen, $n, I'm looking forward to finally vacating this killbox so I can get away from these goblins and drop the cheer-act. If you'd like to continue to advance the interests of Gnomeregan, and by extension the Alliance, in the area, head south to Bootlegger Outpost.$B$BTalk to Zeke Bootscuff there, and remember that any work for the Steamwheedle will help us shut the Bilgewater out of Tanaris for good.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Talk to Zeke Bootscuff at Bootlegger Outpost.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You know, I'm usually not impressed when I see a $r, but I've heard about what you've been doin' for the Steamwheedle. You're alright, kid.</RewardText>
