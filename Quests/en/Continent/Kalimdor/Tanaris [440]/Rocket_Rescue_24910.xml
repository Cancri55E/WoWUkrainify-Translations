  <Title>Rocket Rescue</Title>
  <Description>Alright, $n. We've done enough small jobs around here; it's time to seal the deal.$B$BThe ruins of Steamwheedle Port are still full of hapless Steamwheedle goblins, waiting to be rescued. Every single one of them is a potential future customer. They're firing on every boat that leaves port...so I say we take to the skies!$B$BThere's a hot air balloon just outside of town near the docks, we can use that. Go ahead and hop in, I'll catch up with you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver Life-Rockets to 5 Steamwheedle Survivors and use bombs to kill 40 Southshore Blockaders.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What's with the premature bail-out? We gotta get back out there.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Isn't it nice when you can do a good deed, and see enormous future financial gains from it? It warms my little goblin heart. And my big goblin wallet.$B$BYou did great, kid. Gadgetzan's gonna be ours soon. Here's a little token of my appreciation.</RewardText>
