  <Title>Lootin' Plunder</Title>
  <Description>It's just really so wasteful that all these pirates have golden treasures lying around. Some of this stuff could be used for practical things! Like melting into wire, or intrinsic shielding matrices, or selling to other stupid races that buy gold just to keep it around.$B$BAnd speaking of other stupid races, I bet those greedy goblins are going to be taking all of it. We can't let that happen! Go collect that treasure for Gnomeregan!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 pieces of Pirate Loot.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I hope you don't think you're hiding any for yourself, silly! These goggles can see right through your bags.$B$BAnd your armor.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Fantastic! Gosh, this will make enough wire for an entire army.$B$BLucky us!</RewardText>
