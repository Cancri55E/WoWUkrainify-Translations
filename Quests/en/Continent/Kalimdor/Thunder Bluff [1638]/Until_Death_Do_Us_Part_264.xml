  <Title>Until Death Do Us Part</Title>
  <Description>Filthy scum! Leaves me for his damn crusade. Because "the Light is the most important thing we have against the threats the undead pose."$B$BWell, what about his children?! What about ME?! Night after night I sat patiently waiting for him... always second to his blasted duty!$B$BWell, witness what "justice" brings you, $n! He's dead and I'm bearing the very thing he was trying to stop!$B$BTake this piece of junk and put it on his tomb at the Sepulcher. I want nothing to do with it anymore... or him!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place Clarice's Pendant on Yuriv's Tomb in Silverpine.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The stone is cold to the touch, but has obviously been abused. Trash litters the area; nicks and gashes decorate the relief atop the coffin; and the foliage around the grave has started to grow over the site.$b$bNo one cares for whoever is buried here, especially not any victims of the plague.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You place the worthless pendant on the grave, and the gemstone within the setting seems to dull noticeably.$b$bAs you stand to leave, you look down at the pendant; it lies lifelessly over the hands of the relief sculpted into the top of the coffin. Your thoughts are interrupted by a stiff, cool breeze passing over the Sepulcher. For a moment everything around you is silent.</RewardText>
