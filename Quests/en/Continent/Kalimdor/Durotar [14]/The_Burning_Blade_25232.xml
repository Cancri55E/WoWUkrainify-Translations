  <Title>The Burning Blade</Title>
  <Description>I've been sent to investigate the presence of more Burning Blade agents here in Durotar.  To the northeast, you'll find a cave where the organization trains their new recruits.  I'm interested in what exactly they are teaching these neophytes.$b$bI only tell you this because you seem to be looking for work.  If you're interested in a little coin, sack the cave and return with their spellscrolls.$b$bThe cave is somewhat hidden: exit Razor Hill from the east, and follow the canyon's eastern ridge.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 6 Burning Blade Spellscrolls from members of the Burning Blade in Dustwind Cave.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The scrolls, $n, the scrolls!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is quite interesting.  These rites aren't all that different from the spells which are taught to Horde warlocks.  This merits further investigation!</RewardText>
