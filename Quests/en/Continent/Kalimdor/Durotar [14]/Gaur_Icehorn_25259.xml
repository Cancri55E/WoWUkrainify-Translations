  <Title>Gaur Icehorn</Title>
  <Description>I wouldn't normally keep a taunka as a captive, due to their close relationship with the Horde... but this one is a traitor, and a criminal to boot.  Exiled by his own tribe, he canoed down to Azshara and was found stealing supplies from Valormok.  He would have been put to the axe had I not been standing by, wallet in hand.$b$bGaur is my winningest gladiator, $c.  I'll bet you a fist full of silver that you can't beat him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat Gaur Icehorn in combat.</LogDescription>
