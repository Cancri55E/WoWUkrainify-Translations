  <Title>Ignoring the Warnings</Title>
  <Description>Ignore the shaman, soldier.  Certain powers-that-be within the Horde demand that I keep him with me, but I assure you, that Thrall-loving farseer truly sees no farther than the borders of this hut.$b$bElementals war against one another to the west of here.  I normally wouldn't mind, but I need that land clear to secure a broader shipping route to and from the Barrens.  The elementals are normally quite strong, but they are weakened by their attacks against one another.  Use this knowledge to destroy them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy 12 Warring Elementals.  You may slay either Furious Earthguards or Teeming Waterguards.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Elementals?  Pfuh!  No match for the power of the Horde.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>See?  The shaman's tales are nothing but that... a youngling's bedtime stories.  The new Horde takes what it wants, and doesn't waste time with such frivolity.$b$bIf you get a chance, I recommend you tell Shin... and those like him... not to waste any more of your time.</RewardText>
