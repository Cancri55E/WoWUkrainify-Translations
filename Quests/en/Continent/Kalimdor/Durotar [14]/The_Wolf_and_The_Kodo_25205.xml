  <Title>The Wolf and The Kodo</Title>
  <Description>My "associate" here has some plans for you that I don't agree with.  His actions are hasty, uncontrolled, and irresponsible, and you may end up paying for them with your life.$b$bBefore you work with Gor, first listen to the tale that I have to tell.  It's a moralistic story - a fable - but I believe its lesson will prove valuable.  Speak to me when you are ready.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Hear the moral of Shin Stonepillar's story.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Pay close attention to the meaning behind my words, child.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The moral of the story: hasty, lazy actions have ruinous results.  We mustn't take shortcuts... we must work for our rewards.  I've been trying to tell this story to the "Enforcer", but I fear his Hellscream-worshipping skull is a little bit too thick.</RewardText>
