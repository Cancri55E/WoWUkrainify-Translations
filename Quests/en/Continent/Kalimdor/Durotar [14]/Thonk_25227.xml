  <Title>Thonk</Title>
  <Description>$g Oh, sweetie, I just remembered!: Sorry if I've been mean to you.  Sometimes I get a little jealous when other women come into town, as I'm a little insecure about my appearance.;$b$bMy VERY good friend Thonk works in the guard tower on that cliff, just to the northwest of Razor Hill.  He said something about a river overflowing, lots of work to be done, and so on.  I wasn't really paying attention... I was staring into those deep brown eyes of his.$b$b$gWhat, we can't see other people?: Thanks.;</Description>
