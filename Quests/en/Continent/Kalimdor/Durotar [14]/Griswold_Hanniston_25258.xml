  <Title>Griswold Hanniston</Title>
  <Description>Griswold, chained up over there on the cliffs, is my newest gladiator.  We found him just south of here, sniffing around with Northwatch soldiers.  I had my men nab him up, and now he works for me.$b$bHe looks tough enough, but he hasn't really been battle-tested yet.  Go pick a fight with him so I can see if he's worth keeping around.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat Griswold Hanniston in combat.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How did you do?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I'm at a crossroads now, $n... you defeated him easily in combat, but then again, I did get him for free, and he's pretty cheap to feed.  Maybe we'll keep him around for a bit.</RewardText>
