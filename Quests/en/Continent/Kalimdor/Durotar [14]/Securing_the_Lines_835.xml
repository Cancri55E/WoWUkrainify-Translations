  <Title>Securing the Lines</Title>
  <Description>Gazlowe told me once, "Rezlak. There's one thing you need to know in life, and that's if you want something done well, do it yourself."$b$bI can't deal with losing all our caravans, so I'm just going to take matters into my own hands. Harpies plague our supply routes.  If we kill the harpies, the caravans are safe.$b$bOf course, there was one other thing that Gazlowe taught me, and that's "You can get anything done for a price." You in, $n?  Good... I recommend starting in the canyon to the east.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 12 Durotar Harpies.  Any type of harpy will suffice.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You wouldn't think it from a guy like my boss Gazlowe, but he always seemed to know the score. "Don't be afraid to take that big step," he said.$b$bHarpies won't stop bothering us and the caravans won't stop being attacked unless we do something about it, eh?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I think I can breathe easy now, knowing that the harpies won't be bothering our supply caravans anymore. And not one moment too soon, either. I hear I'm being sent some fun little toys with the next shipment!$b$bYou're pretty good at what you do, $n, you ought to track down my boss in Ratchet. I'll bet he could find some work for you.$b$bOh, and don't worry, I wouldn't forget to pay you for the service you provided me.</RewardText>
