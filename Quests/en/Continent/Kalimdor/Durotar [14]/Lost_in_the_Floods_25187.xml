  <Title>Lost in the Floods</Title>
  <Description>The recent cataclysmic events have done more than wash a few boats onto our shore, $c.  The Southfury River has overflowed, and Durotar's entire western basin is now flooded.$b$bThere are still people out there.  I've been searching for a while, but haven't been able to find anything.  Would you mind using my telescope and taking a look for yourself?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Thonk's Spyglass to search for survivors in Southfury Watershed.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What have you seen?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I see... so the trick is that you need to put the LITTLE end of the spyglass up to your eye.  I'll remember that piece of information.</RewardText>
