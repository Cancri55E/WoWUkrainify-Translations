  <Title>Meat Alternatives</Title>
  <Description>In the wild it is actually fairly common for insects to eat others of their species. I wonder if this rings true for the aqir as well.

Could you bring back some meat from the aqir or mantid? We'll see if that's more palatable for our friend here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa pieces of Insectoid Meat from Aqir, Mantid, or other insects in Uldum or the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.</LogDescription>
