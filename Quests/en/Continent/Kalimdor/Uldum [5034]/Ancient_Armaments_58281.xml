  <Title>Ancient Armaments</Title>
  <Description>Fighting a war on several fronts has taken its toll on our supplies. Our blacksmiths cannot repair and replace our soldiers' armor quickly enough, which is leaving us ill-equipped to face so many foes.

Though the Amathet's armor is ancient, it is titan-forged and formidable. If we were able to salvage any, it could prove very useful to our defensive efforts.

Can you help?</Description>
