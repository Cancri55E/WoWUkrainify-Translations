  <Description>Is it just me or does our little friend look lonely? It would make sense that aqir are social creatures, coming from a hive and all. It must be difficult for him not being around any of his kind.

You know, maybe you could find some friends for him. Nothing big and scary, of course, but perhaps some of the smaller scarabs could be safe enough to keep him company.

What do you think?</Description>
