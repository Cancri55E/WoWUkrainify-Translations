  <Title>The Littlest Defender</Title>
  <Description>The Baruk mogu are known for animating ancient statues to serve as defenders of their territory. They are a resilient foe, and much can be learned from battling an enemy with such rigid defenses.

Fortunately, it seems like one of their Stoneshapers mistakenly animated a small idol. It has been discarded as useless to the mogu who made it, but it could prove a valuable training opportunity for our hatchling.

Find this miniature defender in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.</Description>
