  <Description>Scouts have returned recently, nearly on the verge of death, with reports that I find... disconcerting.

Neferset have been spotted wandering the streets of their city to the south.

This would normally be no cause for alarm, except the Neferset were completely wiped out.

I must ask you to investigate further... and if by some foul magic these reports turn out to be true, you must do whatever you can to contain this threat!</Description>
