  <Description>From what we know about the Amathet, they must've been locked away in their tombs for thousands of years. Just think of what we could learn from them!

Of course, that would be a lot easier if they weren't trying to kill us. 

If you happen upon any caches of Amathet relics in your travels, let me know. I'd love to see what sort of mysteries they contain!</Description>
