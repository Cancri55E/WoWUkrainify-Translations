  <Description>You know who would probably know a lot about how to properly incubate this egg? The mantid!

Of course, they're too busy trying to kill us to share their expertise, but there might be another way to benefit from their knowledge!

Perhaps we could repurpose one of their incubation chambers. That could help speed up this process, I'm sure!

If you could find and mark one for me, I could airlift it out of there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Mark an Amber Incubator for H'partho to airlift in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.</LogDescription>
