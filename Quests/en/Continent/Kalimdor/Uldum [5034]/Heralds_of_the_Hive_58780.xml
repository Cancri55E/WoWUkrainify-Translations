  <Title>Heralds of the Hive</Title>
  <Description>The aqir that have assaulted our camp seem to mainly consist of their shock troops. However, our scouts who dare venture behind their lines have spotted a different kind of creature -- tall and thin, wielding dangerous void magic.

My instinct tells me that these creatures are the leaders behind this invasion. They should be seen as targets of opportunity, and cut down wherever they're met.

Are you up to the task?</Description>
