  <Title>Ruinator Xok'nixx</Title>
  <Description>Ar'kali and a group of our warriors are engaged with a most behemothic creature in the heart of the ruins.

She can hold her own against nearly any foe, but I fear it is only a matter of time before this monster is able to wear them down.

Although the creature is occupied for now, if our warriors fall, the ruins will be lost to us.

Please, make haste, with your help they can surely fell this titanic foe.</Description>
