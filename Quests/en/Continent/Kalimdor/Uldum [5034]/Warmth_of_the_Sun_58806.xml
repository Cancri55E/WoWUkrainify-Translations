  <Title>Warmth of the Sun</Title>
  <Description>The desert nights in Uldum can get awfully cold. I fear for our little egg's ability to withstand these temperatures.

These Amathet to the East seem to have mastered the harnessing of the sun's energy. If we could borrow some of their expertise, we could use it to keep the egg nice and cozy.

Keep your eyes open for something we can use.</Description>
