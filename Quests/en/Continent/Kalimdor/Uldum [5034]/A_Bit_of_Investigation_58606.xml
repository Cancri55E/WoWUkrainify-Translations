  <Title>A Bit of Investigation</Title>
  <Description>$p, this may be the discovery of a lifetime!

I cannot yet say with absolute certainty, but I have a suspicion that these insects are known as the aqir.

The League has few intact records, but the last mention of these creatures describes a great war waged between the C'Thraxxi, aqir, and early troll civilizations.

We had assumed they were driven to extinction, but they may have simply been... rebuilding.

Could you please collect some samples for me to examine?</Description>
