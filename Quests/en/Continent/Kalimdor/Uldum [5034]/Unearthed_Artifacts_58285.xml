  <Title>Unearthed Artifacts</Title>
  <Description>Ever since the Amathet came out of their tombs, they've been busy unearthing titan relics from the surrounding areas. 

I'm not sure what they intend to do with them or if they're just hoarding it so we can't have them. Sufficed to say the Explorer's League would love to study some of what they found!

Of course, we can't get anywhere close to them without the Amathet trying to stick an axe in us, but that's not a problem for you, is it?
