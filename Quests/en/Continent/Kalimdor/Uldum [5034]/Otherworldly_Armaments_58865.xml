  <Title>Otherworldly Armaments</Title>
  <Description>To craft a saddle for your beast, I'll need some special materials. Mainly, it will require metals much lighter than what we have available.

I have noticed that the Black Empire cultists carry with them weapons made from otherworldly materials, which are impossibly light and strong. 

If you could retrieve some of their weapons for me, I may be able to melt down this metal and shape it into a saddle for the aqir.</Description>
