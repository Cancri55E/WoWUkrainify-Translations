  <Title>Wastewander Coins</Title>
  <Description>It may be too late for some of our fallen brothers and sisters, but it is not too late to give solace to their families.

Every Wastewander carries with them a unique coin, signifying their status as a member of our group.

If you find any of these coins, please bring them to me and I will make sure they are properly returned to their next of kin.</Description>
