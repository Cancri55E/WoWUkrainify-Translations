  <Title>Anchors of the Black Empire</Title>
  <Description>This invasion struck us without warning, with structures reminiscent of the Black Empire materializing out of nothing, pouring out the forces of the Old Gods. We have no idea how they came to be or where they came from.

However, whenever a new structure appears, it is preceded by malefic obelisks. We believe these obelisks act as anchors to usher in more of the Old Gods' forces.

If we truly wish to stem the tide of this invasion, we must destroy the obelisks.</Description>
