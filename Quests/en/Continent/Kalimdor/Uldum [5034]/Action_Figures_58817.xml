  <Title>Action Figures</Title>
  <Description>It occurs to me that our larva's current living situation is quite dull. We should try to find something to keep him entertained.

After all, a happy larva is a healthy larva!

I think the Amathet keep figures for worship of their gods. I'm sure they could also double as toys for our little friend here. See if you can find some!</Description>
