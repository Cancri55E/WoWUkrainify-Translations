  <Title>Burn the Bodies</Title>
  <Description>The bugs seem to be indiscriminately laying eggs all over the nearby corpses.

They are using them as food to spawn more of those horrible things. Disgusting!

We can mourn the dead later, but if any more bugs are allowed to hatch we may not live long enough to do so.

Burn the bodies and destroy those eggs!</Description>
