  <Title>A Shocking Technique</Title>
  <Description>I have heard tales that the mogu use lightning to speed up the growth of their cloud serpents. I wonder if the same principle could be used for our aqir friend?

There's only one way to find out! Go to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms and see if you can get the parts together so we can create our own lightning rods. 

If they work the same as they do for the cloud serpents, it should speed up the hatching process significantly.</Description>
