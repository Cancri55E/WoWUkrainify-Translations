  <Title>Wounded Wastewanderers</Title>
  <Description>Ahh, my friend, have you returned to render additional aid?

As you can see, we are still locked in battle with these creatures, with no end to their numbers in sight.

This is a war of attrition and we find ourselves at a clear disadvantage as injuries continue to mount.

Please, assist any of our wounded that you find within the ruins.</Description>
