  <Title>Order Among Chaos</Title>
  <Description>It has been a long time since the tol'vir have squared off against the forces of an Old God, so our tactical knowledge of their forces is limited.

However, one tenet of combat always holds true -- striking down those that issue the orders will weaken the foe much greater than the rank and file. 

I have observed that the larger faceless minions act as commanders of the Old Gods' forces. Silence them, and perhaps we can sow a different kind of chaos in their ranks.</Description>
