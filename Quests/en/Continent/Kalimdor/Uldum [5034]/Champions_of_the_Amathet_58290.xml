  <Title>Champions of the Amathet</Title>
  <Description>The soldiers of Ramkahen are hearty and reliable. 

I would stand them up against any footman of the Amathet, but some of their higher-caste fighters are too much for even our toughest to handle.

I don't think they'd be a problem for you, though. It would be a boon to our defense efforts if you could handle them while my soldiers engage the rank and file.</Description>
