  <Title>Close to Tears</Title>
  <Description>Our warriors have observed foul manifestations coming forth from numerous void tears within the surrounding jungle. 

They have been but mere weaklings, clearly intended to test our defenses before the real forces arrive.

If we do not deal with this threat now, however, it will only be a matter of time until we are overrun by their fodder.

Find a way to close those portals!</Description>
