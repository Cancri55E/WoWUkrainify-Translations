  <Title>A Rallying Cry</Title>
  <Description>Our lands have been infested by the minions of the Old Gods. They strike at every front, even assailing the very minds of our soldiers.

Our forces cannot handle this for long. We must strike a decisive blow to try to salvage some of their morale.

Find the biggest, slimiest, tentacle-faced monstrosities that you can and bring them down. My men will rally to your example.</Description>
