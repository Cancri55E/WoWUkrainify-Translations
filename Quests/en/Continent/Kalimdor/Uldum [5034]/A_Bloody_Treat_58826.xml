  <Title>A Bloody Treat</Title>
  <Description>I have heard that a clan of the mogu called the Dokani have mastered the harnessing of life force into a substance they call "anima."

If this stuff is indeed life condensed into a liquid form, then it could have spectacular properties when applied to our aqir larva.

Go see if you can bring back some of this anima in a form that we can use. We'll see if our little friend here likes it!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Vials of Purified Anima from Dokani mogu in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.</LogDescription>
