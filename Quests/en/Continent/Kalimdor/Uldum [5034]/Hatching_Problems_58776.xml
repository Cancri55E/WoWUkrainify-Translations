  <Description>The aqir are multiplying faster than we can put them down. If this pace continues, we will be outnumbered before long.

The only way to slow down their assault is to attack their hives directly and destroy their eggs, but we have been unsuccessful in doing so.

That's why I wish to conscript your services.

Will you help?</Description>
