  <Title>Eyes on the Amathet</Title>
  <Description>On behalf of the Explorer's League, I'd like tae thank ye for helping establish the Uldum Accord and buying us some cooperation from Ramkahen.

In the interest of better understanding our foes, Ramkahen has allowed the exploring of the Amathet tombs. Unfortunately, though, their forces are spread too thin to provide protection.

I was hopin' ye could help out with that. 

Think ye could spare some time tae see what they're all about? We can start with an aerial look.</Description>
