  <Title>Uncommon Core</Title>
  <Description>Our scouts have reported that the Amathet are constructing new titanic watchers. 

We had long thought this art was lost to the sands of time. It would appear we were mistaken.

I needn't tell you what a boon it would be to have the aid of watcher constructs in our battles for Uldum. We must unlock the secrets of their construction!

The power of a titanic watcher lies in its core. I ask that you bring one to me, so that our artificers might divine its construction.</Description>
