  <Title>The Element of Supplies</Title>
  <Description>You'll notice that we're slightly ill prepared for battle.$B$BThe tol'vir tribes had never seen any sort of major confrontation for thousands of years.$B$BAll the combat protocols that the titans programmed into our ancestors are still there, though.  Some are part of our instincts, some get passed on as tradition.$B$BBut none of this can compensate for lack of supplies.  We need weapons.  We need armor.$B$BThe best armor is lined with the skin of the riverbed crocolisks nearby.  Help us gather some.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 20 Hardened Crocolisk Hides.</LogDescription>
