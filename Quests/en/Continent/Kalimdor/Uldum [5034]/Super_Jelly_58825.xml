  <Title>Super Jelly</Title>
  <Description>My friends in the Golden Lotus have been telling me some interesting things about the new mantid swarm. Apparently they have developed a concentrated royal jelly that accelerates the growth of newly hatched mantid. 

If this jelly works on mantid, logic would suggest it would work on aqir as well!

See if you can find a sufficient sample of this jelly to help with our larva's growth.</Description>
