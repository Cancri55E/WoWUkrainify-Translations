  <Description>I'd like to see if we can get some more of these flyers in the air to drive back the aqir, but it's nearly impossible to get back to the Obelisk of the Sun with all these bugs in the air.

I think we're going to have to thin them out on the ground before we can hope to gain aerial superiority.

Can I count on you to lend a hand?</Description>
