  <Title>Writs of the Sun King</Title>
  <Description>Very little is known about the Sun King that leads the Amathet. Our observations suggest that those closest to him are the "Suntouched," a unique caste of solar magic practitioners.

I would like very much to learn more about this Sun King but, unlike some members of the Explorer's League, I'm not willing to risk the lives of my researchers to do so. 

You seem to be able to hold your own, though. If you happen upon any records about the Sun King, I'd gladly take them off your hands.</Description>
