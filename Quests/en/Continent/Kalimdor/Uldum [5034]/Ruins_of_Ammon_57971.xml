  <Title>Ruins of Ammon</Title>
  <Description>These things seem to be everywhere and all at once!

Either this was an organized attack, or there are far more of them than we can even comprehend.

$p, I need you to travel to the Ruins of Ammon and find out what the situation is like over there.

If they need help, please try to lend a hand!</Description>
