  <Title>Obelisk of the Sun</Title>
  <Description>I have one more thing I must ask of you, my friend. Completion of this task is critical to our survival here.

Our comrade, Zahra, has taken it upon herself to climb the plateau just east of us to secure one of the old bombers left up there.

So far, our attempts to get word back to Arik have failed. 

However, if you can help her get one of those planes working, we might just have a chance.

Hopefully they can send aid before we are overrun...</Description>
