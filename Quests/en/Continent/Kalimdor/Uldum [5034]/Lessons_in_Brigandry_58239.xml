  <Title>Lessons in Brigandry</Title>
  <Description>The Wastewanders have spent many generations as brigands, whether on land or sea. Though we have decided to hang up that life for a chance at a more peaceful existence, we have not forgotten the lessons we've learned in those days.

One such lesson I feel is particularly relevant now -- when faced with a superior opponent, it often helps to use their weapons against them.

Find their hidden caches and take whatever you can carry. You may just find something that can turn the tide of this battle.</Description>
