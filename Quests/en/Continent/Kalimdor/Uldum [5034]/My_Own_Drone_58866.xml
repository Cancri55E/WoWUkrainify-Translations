  <Description>The saddle is complete. I can't say I enjoyed working with that corrupted metal, but in the end I can easily say this is the finest saddle I have ever crafted.

I know it looks... aggressive, but I assure you that your aqir will find it quite comfortable.

I hope it serves you well.</Description>
