  <Description>Reports from my scouts mention various idols and monuments that the Amathet use to channel their solar magic. 

I don't know exactly what they're up to, but we should take away any possible advantage they have. So, I want you to go over there, and break anything that looks remotely magical.

Just don't tell the Explorer's League. I'll never hear the end of it.</Description>
