  <Title>All Gassed Up</Title>
  <Description>So, I was checkin' all these planes... and you are never gonna believe this, but none of them have any fuel in the tanks!

Saw a few canisters scattered around nearby, surely some a' them have some gas left.

Was gonna collect 'em myself, but these damned bugs came outta nowhere and started swarmin' the place.

Too many here now to deal with on my own, think you'd be able to lend a hand?</Description>
