  <Title>Tend the Wounded</Title>
  <Description>My friend, as you can see here, we are besieged by these terrible creatures.

Many of our comrades have fallen prey to the monsters, but fortunately, we have enough warriors here to keep the threat at bay... for now.

If you are able to assist us, please, tend to our wounded and help clear a path for them to escape the ruins.</Description>
