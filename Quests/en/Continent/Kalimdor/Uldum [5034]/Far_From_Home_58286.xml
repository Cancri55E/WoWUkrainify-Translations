  <Title>Far From Home</Title>
  <Description>The Amathet's conquest of eastern Uldum was sudden, and we were unable to reach some of our farthest settlements in time. 

Fortunately, many of the tol'vir who lived in the conquered territories were not killed, instead being put to work under the Amathet's whip. 

We must take any opportunity we can to free them and return them to their homes.</Description>
