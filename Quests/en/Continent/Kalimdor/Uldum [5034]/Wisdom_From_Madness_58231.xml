  <Title>Wisdom From Madness</Title>
  <Description>In my visions I hear... voices...

Their words are nonsense, but over time patterns arise. I believe there is something important behind what these voices say, but I have yet to decipher a word.

We will need to learn from the source. Find any writings you can among the cultists who travel with these dark creatures. Their ramblings may be the key to understanding the message beneath this madness.</Description>
