  <Title>Word from Orsis</Title>
  <Description>As you can see, $n, we have our hands full here dealing with these disgusting bugs.

Our caravans from the south have stopped arriving and we have received disturbing news from the few who've made it back recently.

I've sent a patrol toward Orsis to investigate; they are past due for a report back.

Can I ask you to check in on them for me?</Description>
