  <Title>Wrapping Up</Title>
  <Description>One oddity I have observed about this egg is that it lacks the protective webbing commonly found throughout the aqir hives. 

I believe this webbing has protective qualities, and could be beneficial to our egg if we can acquire some.

While you're out fighting the insects, see if you can't bring back some of their webbing so we can make a proper cocoon for our growing egg.</Description>
