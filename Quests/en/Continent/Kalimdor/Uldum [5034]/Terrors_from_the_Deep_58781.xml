  <Title>Terrors from the Deep</Title>
  <Description>The Aqir threaten the livelihood of the Wastewanders with each passing day, but I have heard of greater terrors that have been unearthed with them.

Our fighters are able, but I fear what might happen if one of these ancient terrors falls upon us. 

I know that you have experience putting down great foes. I would like to ask you to do the same for us. 

After all, we can hardly help protect the forge if we've been decimated by some long-buried monster.</Description>
