  <Title>Wastewander Hosts</Title>
  <Description>The bugs have been laying eggs in the corpses of our soldiers, it's absolutely terrifying!

Some of them are rising from the ground as putrid, bloated, hideous monstrosities.

We have to stop them before they continue to bolster their ranks with our fallen.

It's not a pleasant task... but I have to ask you to help me destroy them. Completely.

Grab some bombs behind me, if you'd like.</Description>
