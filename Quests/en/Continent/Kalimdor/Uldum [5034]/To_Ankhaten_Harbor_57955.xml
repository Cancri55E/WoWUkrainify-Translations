  <Title>To Ankhaten Harbor</Title>
  <Description>I fear that I don't yet have the strength to ride out into the sands and face those monsters again.

Ride to the south and find Tracker Samara in the excavation camp formerly known as Schnottz's Landing.

Tell her to halt any caravans that plan to pass this way, lest others are ambushed and met with the same grisly fate.

We must get the word out across Uldum before our forces are further divided!</Description>
