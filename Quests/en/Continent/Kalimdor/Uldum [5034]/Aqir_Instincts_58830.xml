  <Title>Aqir Instincts</Title>
  <Description>In observing the aqir battling the Wastewanders, I have seen the newly hatched immediately join the aqiri assault. It would seem the need for combat is born into these creatures.

We should exercise this in our new hatchling, under your supervision of course. Take him out with you and show him how to fight our enemies. 

He may not be able to fight for long, so don't call him until you're ready for training.

With luck, he will come to see us as part of his hive.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use H'partho's Whistle to summon your Aqir Hatchling and battle enemies in Uldum or Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Fighting tougher and rarer enemies will help your hatchling grow faster.</LogDescription>
