  <Title>Getting Ahead</Title>
  <Description>Morale's been down at the camp lately. Funny how getting chewed on by some bugs can spoil the mood of a place.

I've got an idea to perk the troops back up, though. We need a trophy!

See if you can get me the head of one of those big tanky-looking ones so we can put it on display to show these bugs that we mean business! Just try to make sure it's not too mangled, okay?</Description>
