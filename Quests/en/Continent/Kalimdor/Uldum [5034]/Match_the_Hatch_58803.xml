  <Title>Match the Hatch</Title>
  <Description>Don't fret, I'm sure no ill will become of hatching this creature. After all, the aqir can't be born evil, can they?

Of course, we have no idea how to take care of such an egg. I will need you to do some investigating.

Head back to the aqir hives and see if you can find any other, similar eggs. If we can observe how they're being treated, we might be able to apply those learnings here.</Description>
