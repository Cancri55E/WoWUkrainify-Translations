  <LogDescription>Call in Airborne Priests at the bodies of 8 Wounded Soldiers on the Shattered Strand.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It's a solid business model - Bedlam thought this one out pretty well.  We hire 3 times as many people as we intend to pay, and depend on the rest to lose their money to resurrection fees.$B$BSome of them even come back owing US money. Hah!</CompletionText>
