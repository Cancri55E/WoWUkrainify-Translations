  <Title>Gunk in the Trunk</Title>
  <Description>Those ancient ruins have survived ten thousand years of wind and weather, so I brought out my biggest and bestest bulldozer to flatten 'em. I call her "Margene."$B$BBut my dozer's been letting me down lately, $n. The moment I drove her into those haunted woods, her engine seized up with a spine-chilling howl. Now my engineers tell me something's clogging her valves. Go over there and inspect Margene's engine compartment, and bring me back a sample of whatever gunk has her stalled.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Inspect Clubnik's Dozer and collect a sample of the Ectosplatter that's gumming up the engine.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Margene is one heck of a machine, isn't she?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Busted ball bearings! Look at this stuff - ugh, SMELL this stuff - my poor, poor dozer!$B$B$n, I consider myself a goop expert and this here goop ain't natural. It's supernatural. This is ghost goop. We're going to need more than a mechanic...</RewardText>
