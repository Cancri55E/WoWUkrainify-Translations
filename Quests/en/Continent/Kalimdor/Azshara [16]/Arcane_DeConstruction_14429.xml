  <Title>Arcane De-Construction</Title>
  <Description>Arcane constructs are creatures spawned of pure mana and intellect. In the right hands, a construct allows its user to quickly assimilate vast riches of arcane knowledge. But they're dangerous, $n. So intelligent! So powerful! So very vulnerable to external tampering...$B$BLet's teach these amateurs a lesson and use their own magic against them. Slay Apprentices and collect their runestones for me. Contact me via the lower scrying stone when you're done.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Apprentice Investigators and Apprentice Illuminators to collect 10 Attuned Runestones.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Andorel's image is blurry and indistinct. He squints at you and taps against the glass of the scrying stone.&gt;$B$B$n, is that you? The resolution on this stone is terrible. What kind of hardware are they using?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good work getting those runestones. To be honest, I only needed one, but the thought of so many night elves slain for such useless baubles fills me with a dark, giddy joy.$B$BPlease hold one of those runes up to the scrying stone to let me see. Hmmm. As I suspected, an amateur effort at best.</RewardText>
