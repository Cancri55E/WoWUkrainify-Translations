  <Title>Rigged to Blow</Title>
  <Description>This tower was out of cannon range, so I thought we'd blow it up the old-fashioned way - in person. We set all the main charges but the guards fought us back before we could arm the detonators.$B$B$n! Get up there and arm the three detonators we placed around the base of the tower. Those things are wired into a pack of thermals I set up along the spine... It'll be some show!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Arm the three Explosive Charges located around the base of the southern-most tower at Talrendis Point.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get 'em? Did you get all three?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Sweet. Let's torch this banana stand!</RewardText>
