  <Title>Befriending Giants</Title>
  <Description>A cursory study of the azsharite you brought me reveals that it's not biological in nature, nor is it naturally formed. There's another creature in Azshara with similar properties: the cliff giants that lumber around these cliffs.$B$BOne of the giants seems willing to help our research along. Take the meat you collected to Gormungan, the giant standing just west of here. Befriend him, then grill him - find out if he knows the secret of azsharite!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Talk to Gormungan outside of the Southern Rocketway Terminus and discover the secret of azsharite.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What did you discover? You look pale, $c!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Speak slower - what are you saying? Am I hearing you right? Those formations of azsharite are actually where the giants have - oh my. Groady!! Let's not tell Dr. Grapplehammer, he's made this stuff his life's work.$B$BWell, at least now we know where azsharite comes from, and why it's so rare. We've got to figure out a way to speed up, uh, "production!" </RewardText>
