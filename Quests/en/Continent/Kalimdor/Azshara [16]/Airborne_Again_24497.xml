  <Title>Airborne Again</Title>
  <Description>We just got word from Valormok that we can't send anymore windriders that way unless we want them shot down by Talrendis snipers. We can't give up Valormok if we want a secure route to Ashenvale, so we're going in another way.$B$BThe airborne priests have graciously offered to drop some people in for us from above sniper range. Head up to the military area and secure a ride on one of their planes. They'll get you there in one piece, and hopefully once you're there, you can resecure our windrider lines.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Secure a ride to Valormok with the Airborne Priests in the eastern portion of Bilgewater Harbor.</LogDescription>
