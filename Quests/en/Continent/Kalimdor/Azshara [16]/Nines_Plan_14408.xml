  <Title>Nine's Plan</Title>
  <Description>My benefactors used their diminutive intellect to construct an interplanetary transport. As designed, this so-called "Rocket" is a death trap. But I suspect a simple re-engineering of the fuel catalyst semifold would render a stable mixture, providing a breathable oxygen byproduct. To implement such changes, I require the original engineering plans.$B$BLocate the Laboratory Archives and ring the doorbell to gain entry. The plans will be held by the lab director himself, presuming he still lives.
</Description>
  <LogDescription>Acquire the Secret Rocket Plans from the Laboratory Archives building at the eastern end of the Secret Lab. Ring the door buzzer outside and kill the lab director when he emerges.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I suspect the archives are close, $n. Locate those plans!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The raptor snatches the paperwork in her prehensile claws and holds the schematics up to her face, clucking her pointed teeth dismissively.&gt;$B$BThese are like the scrawling of children. Common sense precludes the routing of control hydraulics so near to the secondary stage burners! Still, this is salvageable.$B$BDo you know how to refactor fuel matrixes for pressure variations at a fixed acceleration? No? Very well, perhaps you can do something else for me while I reconfigure the rocket...</RewardText>
