  <Title>Ice Cold</Title>
  <Description>I've got the perfect solution to our drake problem. My very own Cryomatic 16.$B$BI originally developed it to freeze my workers during transport and between shifts so that I wouldn't have to feed and entertain them, but there were... complications. It should be perfect for dropping these drakes out of the sky though!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Cryomatic 16 to freeze and kill 8 Sable Drakes.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I wonder if there's any market for frozen, shattered drake parts. Maybe with a bit of marketing, I could pitch it as a new delicacy?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>What? So you didn't bring any of the drake pieces back? Disappointing.$B$BI knew I should have made you sign a contract before I sent you out...</RewardText>
