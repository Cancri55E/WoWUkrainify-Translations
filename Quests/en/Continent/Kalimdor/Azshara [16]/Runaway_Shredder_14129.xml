  <Title>Runaway Shredder!</Title>
  <Description>I've been trying to impress our new Horde allies with our legendary goblin efficiency, but in hindsight automating the shredders was a bad idea. Now they're mindless killing machines, rampaging over the countryside. Don't get me wrong - that kind of thing has its place - but for the time being I need a brave $c to help me get these things under control.$B$BIt's easy. Automated shredders, like all machines, must first be beaten into submission. Afterwards, seize the controls and I'll radio you instructions.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Attack one of the Runaway Shredders near the rear gates of Orgrimmar and hop inside once it's been significantly damaged.</LogDescription>
