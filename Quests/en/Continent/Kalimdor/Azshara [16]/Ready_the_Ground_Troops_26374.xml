  <Title>Ready the Ground Troops</Title>
  <Description>It was a bad idea to muster the troops in this festering goblin metropolis. Every vice that coin can buy is within arm's reach. Our mighty veterans are running rampant, blowing years of Northrend back-pay in a city-wide debacle.$B$BCan you make a sweep through the city and gather up any stragglers that have gone AWOL?$B$BMy axebite warriors are unmatched on the battlefield, but I won't have them disgrace their uniforms while on shore leave.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search Bilgewater Harbor and convince 12 AWOL Grunts to report for duty.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you found my missing troops?$B$BBe sure to search every filthy back-alley. If there's trouble, they'll find it.</CompletionText>
