  <Title>Beating the Market</Title>
  <Description>&lt;It's not hard to see why the Foebreaker is behind schedule. Every other day, a foreman comes in and changes the blueprints.&gt;$B$B&lt;Most troubling are the recent alterations. The workers have been ordered to remove rivets to save on costs!&gt;$B$B&lt;You'd better track down one of the Bilgewater foremen responsible for this and make an example out of him, before any Horde lives are lost in a faulty ship.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Track down a Bilgewater Foreman somewhere in Bilgewater Harbor and knock him around a little. </LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So they were trying to skimp on production costs? Unacceptable!$B$BI'm glad you knocked some sense into them. If that foreman makes good on his word, our fleet will be ship-shape in time for the invasion.</RewardText>
