  <Title>Fade to Black</Title>
  <Description>Now we put an end to all this madness. We need to rout the black dragonflight from Azshara entirely before they can return with any communication for their master.$B$BI still don't know what they have up their sleeve for capturing us, so I'd like to ask this one last thing of you - go into sable ridge and kill their leaders, Twilight Lord Katrana and Malicion.$B$BIf things get hairy, I will come help. I just don't want to risk falling into whatever trap they set for Azuregos.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Kill Twilight Lord Katrana and Malicion in Sable Ridge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I will be glad to be done with these wretches.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You truly amaze me, mortal. It's rare to meet someone so dedicated and resourceful.$B$BAzuregos and I are likely to depart Azshara and remain discrete for a while. I do hope that we meet again someday though. Perhaps to put an end to Deathwing himself.$B$BFarewell, $n. Stay safe.</RewardText>
