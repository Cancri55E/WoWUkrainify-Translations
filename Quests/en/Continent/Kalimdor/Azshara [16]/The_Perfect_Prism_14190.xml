  <Title>The Perfect Prism</Title>
  <Description>There's got to be a way to reverse the basilisks' stonification. Those irritating night elf saboteurs who have been lurking around my mine must know something we don't. They seem to be immune to the gaze of the beast!$B$BI want you to find out their secret, $n. Pick off a few of the Talrendis saboteurs skulking about in the rear of the strip mine and get a sample of whatever charm or ding-dong they're wearing to give them immunity. Radio me from the main forge building once you're successful.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Acquire a Crystal Pendant from a Talrendis Saboteur in the Mountainfoot Strip Mine.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Strange goblin speakers hiss and crackle.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Zignibble's voice squawks over the speakers.&gt;$B$BIs that you, $n? Still alive? You aren't trashing my explosive stockpiles are you?$B$BHmmm... you say you found a clear crystal pendant. That makes sense. A perfect prism would refract the gaze of the basilisk. Maybe we can use this to our advantage. Time to drop some science!</RewardText>
