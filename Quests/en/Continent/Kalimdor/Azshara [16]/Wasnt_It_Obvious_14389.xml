  <Title>Wasn't It Obvious?</Title>
  <Description>Azuregos! Yes, of course. Troubled old dragon, but lovely heart. I don't think all the years of vagabonds assaulting him have done him much good. He's a mite strange these days.$B$BNot long ago, when returning yet again to our local Spirit Healer, Anara, I couldn't help but notice that her and Azuregos seemed to be hitting it off. I imagine he's still keeping her company.$B$BThe portal behind me is probably the quickest way to reach her. It might sting a little though.</Description>
  <AreaDescription>Find Anara, and hopefully, Azuregos.</AreaDescription>
