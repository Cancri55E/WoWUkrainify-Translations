  <Title>Profitability Scouting</Title>
  <Description>Things seem to be quieting down a bit. Gallywix will probably keep forking out cash to keep us posted here, but I have a feeling we might be able to milk a bit more out of the deal.$B$BNaga and Sea Giants aren't normally friends, so the naga must be controlling them somehow. Take this stealth field generator, get in those ruins, and let me know if you find something that looks really pricey.</Description>
  <AreaDescription>Heart of Arkkoroc identified</AreaDescription>
  <LogDescription>Use the stealth field generator to infiltrate the Ruins of Eldarath and identify the Heart of Arkkoroc.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Our stealth field generator has the same acronym as our rocket launcher. Probably poor planning on our part.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hahah! Sweet deal. I'll get the ball rolling on this. All I need now is to find a buyer and get the go-ahead from Uncle Bedlam.$B$BHere are your wages for your work here. Excellent work, soldier.</RewardText>
