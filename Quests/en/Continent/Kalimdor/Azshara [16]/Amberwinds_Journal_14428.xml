  <Title>Amberwind's Journal</Title>
  <Description>If my sources are trustworthy, Lorekeeper Amberwind is overseeing the Alliance investigation of the ruins to the east. I have not yet probed the extent of her abilities: I'm hoping you can give me a full report by engaging her in combat and destroying her.$B$BWith a title like 'Lorekeeper,' I'm guessing Amberwind will have a journal on her that'll tell us exactly what those night elves are up to. Fetch that journal for me. No need to run back; use their own scrying stones to contact me remotely.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>Hopefully she carries the information we need.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Slay Lorekeeper Amberwind at the Darnassian Base Camp and retrieve her journal.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Andorel's distorted face appears within the scrying stone.&gt;$B$B$n, have you made contact? What can you tell me?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Amberwind was making use of an Arcane Construct? Hah! How delightfully inexperienced. It's like watching children play with firearms.$B$BLet's take a look at that journal, $n. Hold it up to the scrying stone... keep it still ...$B$B&lt;A green beam of light scans across the text of the book as you hold it against the orb.&gt;</RewardText>
