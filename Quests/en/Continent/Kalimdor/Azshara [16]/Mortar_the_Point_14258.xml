  <Title>Mortar the Point</Title>
  <Description>The Naga started making a move on the peninsula here after we finished building this rocketway terminal. But there's no problem in this world that can't be solved with gratuitous firepower! That's what my daddy used to say. Before the accident.$B$BI'm running short on supplies, though. Do me a favor and collect the mortar shells I left stockpiled in the Secret Lab just west of here. Keep me supplied and I'll let you call in the artillery strikes! </Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 5 Goblin Mortar Shells from the Secret Lab complex in Azshara.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I hope you have more ammo for me. I've got nothing to shoot off over here but my mouth!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Sweet! Beautiful! Brilliant! Who loves you?$B$BWith my mortars re-supplied, I can help you as you assault the Naga east of here. Use these markers to call in an artillery strike anywhere on the cliffs, and I'll splatter the whole area with fiery hurt. Oh delicious, merciless, random destruction! I hope you're well-armored...</RewardText>
