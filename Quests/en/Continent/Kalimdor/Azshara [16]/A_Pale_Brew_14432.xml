  <Title>A Pale Brew</Title>
  <Description>It looks like our Alliance foes have been making headway with their Blackmaw talks by conducting negotiations in the furbolg tongue. If we're to sabotage the treaty, we're going to have to do the same.$B$BIt's not as hard as it sounds, $n. The Blackmaw make a potent herbal tea, the fumes of which will place one in a trance-like state where you'll start speaking in tongues. The Blackmaw tongue, specifically. Go to Blackmaw Hold southwest of here and get me some samples of that briaroot brew!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather up 10 samples of Briaroot Brew from outside Blackmaw Hold.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How goes the hunt? I sampled that briaroot stuff myself once, but it was too bitter, even for an old gravel-eater like myself.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah good, that's plenty. We'll boil this stuff up and you can bask in the fumes for a while - you'll be speaking like a furbolg in no time. Our plan is beginning to take shape...</RewardText>
