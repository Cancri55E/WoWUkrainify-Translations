  <Title>The Blackmaw Scar</Title>
  <Description>The Blackmaw furbolg that live in this area have broken rank with their Timbermaw brethren as we began to aggressively settle Azshara. They've gone wild, $c, and harass our forces at every turn. Worse, we have seen them engaging the night elves from Talrendis on friendly terms. We cannot allow the two to ally!$B$BJust southwest of here you will find a great scar across the earth where my scouts report night elven activity. Slay them and gather any intelligence you find. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 8 Talrendis Biologists and gather up Blackmaw Intelligence from one of the bodies.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The Blackmaw are ferocious. Were they ever to organize, they would prove to be an immense disruption to our work here.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I see... This definitely looks like a working draft of some sort of treaty. That's a worst-case scenario for us, $n: Night elves coordinating attacks with entrenched furbolg allies.$B$BMy initial instinct - a full-out frontal assault - would only drive them into the arms of the Alliance. We will have to take a different approach...</RewardText>
