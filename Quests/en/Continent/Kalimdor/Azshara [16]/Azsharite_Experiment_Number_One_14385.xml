  <Title>Azsharite Experiment Number One</Title>
  <Description>Well, I can think of one surefire way to send a giant running to the bathroom, but you're not going to like it. What we need is a ... massive ... laxative. Oh hey! Would you believe the gnomes have something of the sort? That can't be a coincidence. I wonder what they're trying to push through over there?$B$BOur intelligence reports that the laxative was delivered to Gadgetspring's tower, down on the shoreline south of the Secret Lab. Retrieve that laxative and feed it to Gormungan!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Grab a giant-sized laxative from the gnomish tower in the Ruined Reaches. Try to feed the laxative to Gormungan the giant.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Once you have the laxative, try to feed it to Gormungan. And maybe give him a magazine or something. Do it for science!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>So it was a no-go? Literally? Well, Grapplehammer won't take no for an answer. We'll have to try something else.$B$BMaybe I'll have my interns smuggle this laxative into the night elf encampment. That'll be good for a laugh, at least.</RewardText>
