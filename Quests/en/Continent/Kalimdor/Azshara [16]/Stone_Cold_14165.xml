  <Title>Stone Cold</Title>
  <Description>Workers act like it's their job to complain. If it isn't the backbreaking labor, the long hours, or the low pay, it's being turned to stone by basilisks. It's always something!$B$BBut I'm thinking maybe this whole workers-to-stone business could be a big moneymaker for me. What if those guys are now high-quality stone? My whiny employees could be worth more to me as luxury building materials than a source of labor! Grab a stonified mountainfoot miner and haul him or her back to me. </Description>
  <AreaDescription>Stonified Miner Delivered</AreaDescription>
  <LogDescription>Collect a stonified Mountainfoot Miner from the Mountainfoot Strip Mine and bring him or her back to Horzak Zignibble at the Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Get to the strip mine, $n, and get me a sample of one of my former workers!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well well, let's take a look at what we got here...$B$B&lt;Horzak examines the shattered remains of the poor petrified miner.&gt;$B$BBah! Crumbly! Useless. Wouldn't even make a good countertop. My miners may be mediocre workers, but they make lousy bricks.$B$B&lt;Sigh&gt;. Well, I suppose we should re-fleshify these guys so I can get some return on my investment.</RewardText>
