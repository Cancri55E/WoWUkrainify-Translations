  <Title>Farewell, Minnow</Title>
  <Description>Thank you, little one.$B$BSometimes it's easy to get lost in the throes of love and lose sight of things, even as a dragon. I plan to rededicate myself entirely to making sure Kalec never steps up to take Malygos' place. It's the most noble cause I can think of.$B$BYou should head back to the harbor. I believe someone's waiting for you there.$B$BTry not to get squashed or eaten by anything.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Sorata Firespinner in Bilgewater Harbor.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Hey there... again.$B$BLook, I gave you my hat. It was a gift. I thought you'd make some use of it. More specifically though, I thought you'd get it the heck away from me.$B$BCan you imagine my surprise when Xylem comes by himself to give it back to me? "Want to be more like my other apprentices, Sorata? Give your hat another try."  Not one of my proudest moments.$B$BSo what... you just tossed it aside for him to find? No. I don't think so. You're going to take this hat and you're going to like it. Really.</RewardText>
