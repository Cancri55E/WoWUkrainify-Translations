  <Title>Azsharite Experiment Number Two</Title>
  <Description>Okay, new plan. We'll SCARE it out of 'em! In my experience most large creatures are terrified of tiny ones - like rats. Hmm. This place is crawling with rats, but how do we coax them over to the giant?$B$BHey! You don't mind having your cellular matrix broken down and reassembled do you? It's only painful while it's happening. I can shrink you down to rat-sized and you can ride one of these brutes over there like a horse. It's so crazy it's got to work! Speak with me when you're ready for shrinkage...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Assistant Greely to be shrunken down to rat-size. Mount a Rocketway Rat and use it to terrify Gormungan the giant.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hey $n, you look shaken up. Did you scare the giant into going to the bathroom? Or yourself?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>So scaring him didn't work, either? Double-nertz! I'll have to break the news to Grapplehammer: Azsharite's going to remain the rarest substance on the planet. We'll have to use it sparingly.</RewardText>
