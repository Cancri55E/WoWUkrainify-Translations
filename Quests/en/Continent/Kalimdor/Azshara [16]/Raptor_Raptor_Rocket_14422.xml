  <Title>Raptor Raptor Rocket</Title>
  <Description>Shortly after my intellect was augmented, I bred with Subject Four in order to create a unique race of cognitively superior raptors. Subsequently, Subject Four neither called nor wrote: I have determined to disembowel him upon our next encounter.$B$BNonetheless, there are enough raptor children imprisoned in this lab to provide adequate genetic stock for repopulating my race. Please release them from their cages and carry them to the rocket.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Release five Experimental Raptors from their cages in the Secret Lab and deliver them to the rocket beside Subject Nine.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>My beautiful children may attempt to bite you upon release, but at their stage of physical development, it is unlikely that their attacks will be fatal.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Wonderful! Exemplary work, $n! As you have no doubt surmised, my objective with regard to this rocket is to utilize it as a sort of astral cradle, an ark if you will, allowing my newly-forged race to slip the surly bonds of this ravaged planet and colonize a world to our own liking. You have been instrumental to our cause. Please accept this currency as I will be minting my own monetary units upon arrival. Farewell, $n!</RewardText>
