  <Title>The Trial of Fire</Title>
  <Description>The Trial of Fire... oooh... sounds intimidating, doesn't it? No? Hm. Well I kind of thought so. Firsts are first, you touch the fire crystal and the portal to the trial opens.$B$BTo beat this trial, you have to hop around in the fire runes without getting hit by the fire. If you stay unflamed long enough, you win!$B$BThere are little signs to help you - fire hopping to its new rune, fizzles when a rune goes cold. You can figure that stuff out if you want. Or just guess! That's what most people do.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Complete the Trial of Fire by standing in the fire runes without getting hit by flame for 10 consecutive bursts.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Um, no. You're not done. Get back in there and get toasty!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Woo! Good for you! That trial really put a fire under your bottom.</RewardText>
