  <Title>Ticker Required</Title>
  <Description>Our best demo-man, Ticker, is on assignment with the Gob Squad. He's got WAY more than enough explosives for all the runestones in the ruins.$B$BAll you have to do is get him there and keep him covered - he'll handle the rest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Ticker into the ruins and cover him as he sets up bombs at 3 of the Spitelash Runestones.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Ticker's a man after my own heart. Couldn't be prouder.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The hope is that that cuts off a major source of their magic. The truth is, we don't really have a clue. Who can pass up an opportunity to blow some stuff up though.</RewardText>
