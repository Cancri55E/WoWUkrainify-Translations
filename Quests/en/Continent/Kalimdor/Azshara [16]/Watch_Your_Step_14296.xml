  <Title>Watch Your Step</Title>
  <Description>This is somewhat simple and somewhat not simple. All the way up there are Energy Conduits. Rather like this one right here one might say! Indeed, I do say.$B$BNow for you. You must use my jump pads to ascend the pinnacle, and you must touch all of the conduits you see along the way. When you get to me at the top, you should be all juicy with energy, because really that's the only way to be.$B$BAnd be sure to keep moving or you're likely to be sent for quite a trip!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Receive 6 Energized charges from the Energy Conduits as you ascend to the top of the Arcane Pinnacle.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>No no no, you've got it all wrong. You were supposed to gather Energy from the Conduits before you came up here, remember?$B$BOne more time, with style!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It is in this moment that most of my apprentices wonder if there was a logical purpose to storing the energy for my portal in those conduits so that it has to be collected in such a fashion.$B$BOf course there's a purpose! I wish to study your behavior... your strategies, your mistakes, your frustrations, your triumphs. Those are the entire point of these trials.$B$BNow, more. More trials! Doesn't that sound exciting?! Of course it does.</RewardText>
