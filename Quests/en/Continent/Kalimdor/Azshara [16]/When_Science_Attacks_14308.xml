  <Title>When Science Attacks</Title>
  <Description>Did you see the explosions on the way in? The Secret Lab is engulfed in flames! Again! If we don't stamp out those flames we're going to hit critical temperatacity and resonate into a meltdown cascade.$B$BHere, I'm entrusting you with a canister of experimental hypercooled pressurized liquigel: The most volatile fire retardant known to science! (Keep that canister away from open flame.) Put out the fires and hose down my interns, then contact me via the squawkbox in central control.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Fireliminator X-21 to extinguish 8 fires and to rescue 6 Research Interns from the inferno at the Secret Lab.$B$BSee Assistant Greely at the Southern Rocketway Terminus if you lose your Fireliminator.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Greely's squeaky voice peels through a set of speakers.&gt;$B$BRocketway to Secret Lab! Rocketway to Secret Lab! Come in, Secret Lab...</CompletionText>
