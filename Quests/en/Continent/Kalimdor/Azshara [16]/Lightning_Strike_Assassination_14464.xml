  <Title>Lightning Strike Assassination</Title>
  <Description>The base of the tower is patrolled by the Captain's elite guards. So here's what we're going to do: we're going to grapple straight up to the top, slice-and-dice the VIPs, and bail out using my portable low-altitude parachute. I'll rig the tower to explode behind us. You be sure to grab Captain Grunwald's head for Chawg. Got it?$B$BDo NOT accept this mission unless you are prepared for UNMITIGATED BADASSERY. Is that clear? </Description>

  <CompletionText>I trust you've got good news, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I'm impressed by the cleverness of our new goblin allies, but I'm even more impressed by you, $n. Look at the gaze of terror frozen onto the Captain's face! He never saw your attack coming. Imagine the fear this will cause in Northwatch when they see what happened to one of their precious officers in night elf lands.$B$BWell done, $c. Our assault proceeds... </RewardText>
