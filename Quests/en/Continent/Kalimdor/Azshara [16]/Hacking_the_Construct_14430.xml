  <Title>Hacking the Construct</Title>
  <Description>Now we will hack their arcane construct and use it to wreak havoc. Have you done this type of magic before, $n? No? Hah! That makes my plan all the more delicious. Nearby you should see a formidable arcane construct they've summoned. Thanks to the runestones you gathered, we know how to communicate with it. Talk to the construct and say "Al'teth la c'tolgar." Got that? Repeat it? Close enough. Report back to me and let me know what happens! </Description>

  <RewardText>Haha! Hah - HA! Night elf "mages" fleeing their own arcane creation. Your actions have made my month, $n. That's why we blood elves don't use arcane constructs anymore - they've been outlawed for, oh, 1500 years. It's amusing to me to watch our foes repeat the mistakes of the past. "Mages." Indeed. </RewardText>
