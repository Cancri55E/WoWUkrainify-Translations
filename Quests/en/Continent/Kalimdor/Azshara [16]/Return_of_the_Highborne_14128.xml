  <Title>Return of the Highborne?</Title>
  <Description>Our blood elven allies have been examining the ruins marked on this map, and can likely understand this mysterious script. Seek out the one called Malynea Skyreaver. She conducts her research from the Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange just north of here - it's part of the new goblin transit system that snakes across this land. Quickly, now!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver the Scout's Orders to Malynea Skyreaver at the Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I trust this interruption is in regards to something important?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>What? Give that here, this instant! Ag'tor is correct, these are arcane runes. They're scouting out magical sites? Experimenting with the arcane arts? This is a marked departure from thousands of years of night elven history.$B$BHmph! The idea that they will achieve any competence in this field - even those who once counted themselves among the highborne - is absurd.$B$B&lt;Malynea puts aside the scroll dismissively, but her face is furrowed with concern.&gt;</RewardText>
