  <Title>Do the Right Thing</Title>
  <Description>You have come upon a horrific scene. Someone or something has buried all of the humans up to their necks in a manner consistent with planting. The ghouls, which are seemingly tending the field of human seedlings, periodically jump to the nearest human and devour its head!$B$BYou can end this right here and now. Take this shovel and "save" the humans.$B$BDo the right thing.</Description>
  <LogDescription>"Save" 15 Human Seedlings.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Undoubtedly you did the right thing. Hopefully the humans that you saved will show similar mercy to you should the time of your planting ever come.$B$BThis is all assuming you rescued the humans and didn't splatter their brains all over the dirt - of course.$B$BKeep the shovel as a reminder of the horrors of the Sludge Fields and the depravity of mortals.</RewardText>
