  <Title>Can You Smell What the Lok'tar is Cooking?</Title>
  <Description>Shortly before you arrived an orc flew in upon a frost wyrm and demanded that I direct him to where the 'newbies were hanging out.' Uncertain as to the vernacular, I told him to fulfill his duty as a member of the Horde and deal with the worgen threat of the area. He grumbled something about 'what the lok'tar was cooking' and headed south to the docks.$B$BOrdinarily I wouldn't care about whether or not an orc went missing, but I am genuinely curious about what the lok'tar might be cooking. Find out.</Description>
