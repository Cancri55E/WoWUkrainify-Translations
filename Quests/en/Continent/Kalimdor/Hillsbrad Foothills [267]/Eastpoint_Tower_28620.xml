  <Title>Eastpoint Tower</Title>
  <Description>Our outpost in the southeast is having some problems. I don't have any details other than... well, let me just read from the latest letter:$B$B"The orcs have grown petulant. Send help or I will have them beaten with reeds."$B$BThat's it. It was sent from our chief psylosopher, Nils Beerot. Yea, I have no idea what that means either. Could you please head to Eastpoint Tower and find out what he needs? I can't take any more of these cryptic letters!$B$BJust head south and then follow the road east.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Nils Beerot at Eastpoint Tower in Hillsbrad Foothills.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That imbecile finally sent help, did he? These two orcs are a lost cause. They are stricken with something that I have termed "Durnholde Syndrome." They were both locked up for so long that they grew an affinity for their captors. Now they sit upon my couch with their big, iron balls and cry.$B$BHopefully you will prove to be more useful.</RewardText>
