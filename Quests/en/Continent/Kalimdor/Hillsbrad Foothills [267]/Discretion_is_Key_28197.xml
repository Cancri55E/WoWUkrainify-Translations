  <Title>Discretion is Key</Title>
  <Description>We must destroy all of the evidence, $n! Did I say evidence? I meant crazed undead! Anyway, discretion is key. We must not let the rampaging undead make it out of the Sludge Fields and no one outside of this institution must know about what happened here!$B$BDirectly southeast of here in what used to be the old mushroom farm you'll find a reanimated fiend known as Citizen Wilkes and his cohort, Clerk Horrace Whitesteed. They have been causing huge problems for my guards. Find them and kill them!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Citizen Wilkes and Clerk Horrace Whitesteed.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Kill the beasts! We can't have a rampaging geist and skeleton wandering the countryside!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done! Wilkes was hanged after we discovered that he was ingesting mass quantities of mushrooms and other highly toxic substances. After he died he awoke, reborn as an undead geist. Many of my guards fell to Wilkes before he ran off into hiding. Fearing something like this might happen again, we incinerated the Clerk until only bones were left!$B$BWhy would they willingly ingest toxic substances? I have no idea! This is a farm, $g sir:miss;, nothing more!</RewardText>
