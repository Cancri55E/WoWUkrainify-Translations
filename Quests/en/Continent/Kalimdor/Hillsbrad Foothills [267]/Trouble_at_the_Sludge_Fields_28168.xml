  <Title>Trouble at the Sludge Fields</Title>
  <Description>Warden Stillwater, over at the Sludge Fields, north of here, has sent out a distress signal. The missive wasn't clear, but from what I could make of the letter there's a riot happening at the Sludge Fields and most of the guards have been killed. The warden has warned that any would-be-heroes approach from the back entry, located on the western side of the Sludge Fields.$B$BHe's also asked for discretion. He doesn't want news of this little *ahem* uprising to surface.</Description>
