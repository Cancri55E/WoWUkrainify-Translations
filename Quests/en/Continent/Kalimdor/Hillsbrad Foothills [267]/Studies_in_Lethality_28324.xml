  <Title>Studies in Lethality</Title>
  <Description>We used a fairly potent strain of blight against the humans of Southshore. As you can see, it worked. The trouble with blight use, though, is that blight tends to stick around after it's served its purpose.$B$BWhat I need from you is to take this testing kit and get out into the field to get a lethality count from the blight slimes that we've released into the area. Use the lethality analyzer on the blight slimes sweeping the slime pools. Come back to me when you have some solid data.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover 250 Blight Samples.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We need Southshore move in ready!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Oh my. 250? This thing doesn't go past 250. How are you still standing? You should be a puddle of goo by now. Sylvanas will be most displeased with this information. There might be some things we can do to reduce the lethality levels of the area by a few decades, but that still leaves us out by about a hundred or so years.</RewardText>
