  <Title>Humbert's Personal Problems</Title>
  <Description>So this is pretty embarrassing. Where to begin?$B$BWell, you see, Melisara sent me to investigate the yeti menace in the nearby caves, west of here. It was getting late and my armor was weighing heavily on me. I took my gear off and decided to take a stroll. Yes, I, erm, went for a walk. Anyway, when I returned I discovered that my gear had been stolen! It was the yetis. I'm sure of it. They took my pants, sword and helm and ran off into their cave. Get them back for me and I will reward you.</Description>
