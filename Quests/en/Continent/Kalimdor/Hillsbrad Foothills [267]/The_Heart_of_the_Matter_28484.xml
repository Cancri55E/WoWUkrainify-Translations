  <Title>The Heart of the Matter</Title>
  <Description>The magus has been idle for far too long and an idle magus often leads to poorly thought out schemes. This time I am charged with collecting various beast organs in order to power some type of control rod. I am far too frail to go out hunting beasts - especially yetis!$B$BPerhaps if I were to offer you a reward of some kind you would do it? All I need is for you to head west to the yeti caves and kill yetis. Rip their still beating hearts from their chests and bring them back here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 12 Beating Yeti Hearts.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Bring me yeti hearts, $n.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I... um... well... turns out he doesn't need the hearts anymore. Sorry about that! Hope it wasn't too inconvenient! A deal's a deal though, so here is your reward. You can go ahead and keep the yeti hearts. I hear they hold excellent nutritional value - if you're into eating.</RewardText>
