  <Title>Do it for Twinkles</Title>
  <Description>Warden Stillwater sent me out into the field to investigate the outbreak. When I arrived, Twinkles and I were charged by the lumbering monstrosity known as Verringtan. I was knocked off of Twinkles and immediately ran for my life. Twinkles, though, stayed behind and fought the beast off. Alas, she was defeated and then summarily planted in the soil as if she were some type of glorious star pony seedling.$B$BShe gave her life to defend me. Vengeance must be mine! If for nothing else, do it for Twinkles!</Description>
