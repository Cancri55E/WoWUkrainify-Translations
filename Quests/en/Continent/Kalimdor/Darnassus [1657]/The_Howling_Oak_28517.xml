  <Title>The Howling Oak</Title>
  <Description>So this is it... our new home. I'm not sure if I'll ever feel like I truly have a home again.$B$BWe mustn't be unappreciative of what the night elves have offered us though. Their race is not one to throw out idle welcomes to just anyone. It is a true testament to faith and generosity that they've taken us in.$B$BGwen and Greymane are in the city proper, at the Howling Oak. You should stop by. Take the portal beneath the tree north of us, then seek out the Howling Oak in the northern portion of the city.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Genn Greymane at the Howling Oak in Darnassus.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This oak was grown through the aid of the druids from a seed taken back on Gilneas. It stands for all that we've endured, and all that we've accomplished.$B$BMay it serve to remind us that our curse is also our blessing.</RewardText>
