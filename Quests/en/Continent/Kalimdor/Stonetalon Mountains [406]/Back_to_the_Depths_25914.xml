  <Title>Back to the Depths!</Title>
  <Description>Tendrils are bursting forth from the earth and terrorizing Stonetalon Peak. My sentinels are hardly making a dent in their numbers.$B$BI suspect that there is a force at the heart of Stonetalon Peak that controls the tendrils. Perhaps if we can put a stop to that force, the tendrils will return to the depths from whence they came!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Harbinger Aph'lass and 10 Invading Tentacles.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'm afraid that the death of Harbinger Aph'lass has not ceased the tendril attacks. You've done all that you can, $n, and for that I thank you.
