  <Description>I've been waiting on parts for these guns for days! I sent one of my best blastgineers and two dozen miners into the Deep Reaches five days ago for the parts. After not hearing from anybody for three days I began to get a little worried. The Overlord sent two of his best orcs in to see what was going on. We've received no reports since then...$B$BHead into the Deep Reaches, directly below this fortress, and find out what's going on! I need parts!</Description>
