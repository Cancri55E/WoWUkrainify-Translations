  <Title>Between a Rock and a Hard Place</Title>
  <Description>Dontrag can explain it better than me. Basically, we're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Can't do anything down here due to all of the things that can kill us and can't go back to the base due to all of the things that can kill us - you know?$B$BPerhaps if we worked together we might be able to get this mess sorted out. How about you get started by clearing out some of these elementals that have apparently killed everything in the mine, ok?</Description>
