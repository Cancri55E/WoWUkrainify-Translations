  <Title>The Deep Reaches</Title>
  <Description>The purpose of this base was to establish a foothold in Stonetalon for Theramore and to open up a supply line to the night elves. The Horde, unfortunately, has given us one hell of a fight. Hellscream's armies are mighty and unrelenting. I haven't seen this type of ferocity from the Horde since the second war.$B$BNow it would appear that the mine the Explorers' League dug out is being used by the Horde to "backdoor" us. We need to seal that thing off!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Steeltoe McGee at the Deep Reaches in Stonetalon Mountains.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Seal it off? That's gonna take some work, friend.</RewardText>
