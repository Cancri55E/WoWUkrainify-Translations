  <Title>Don't Look Them in the Eyes</Title>
  <Description>Keep your head down, $n. No need to draw unwanted attention.$B$BLooks like the orcs are piling that balloon up with some type of ore from the mine. Get in there and take the ore from the orcs. Bring me back whatever you manage to grab and I'll ship it off to the professor for examination.$B$BBefore you go, a word of advice: you can avoid the Krom'gar pretty easily in there as (1) they're dumb as dirt and (2) they can't see anything if they're carrying ore. Of course, you need to kill them to get their ore.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Azure Iron Ore samples.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Get me those ore samples!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Not too much trouble, I hope. With these samples we should be able to figure out what they plan to do with the ore and the big bomb.</RewardText>
