  <Title>Shuttin Her Down</Title>
  <Description>To bring this mine down you're gonna need to blow up her support beams. I can provide you with the explosives you'll need, but you're gonna have to trudge through Krom'gar assassins to get to all of the beams.$B$BThe good news, if any exists, is that we always mark our support beams with a big 'X.' Look for the markers and plant this dynamite near 'em. Once you've planted all the dynamite come on back up here and I'll activate the explosives.$B$BKaboom!</Description>
