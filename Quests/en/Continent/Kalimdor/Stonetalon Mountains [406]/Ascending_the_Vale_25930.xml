  <Title>Ascending the Vale</Title>
  <Description>I am told that before the great upheaval the Charred Vale was a valley, closed off to the sea. One has merely to look to the south to see that the Charred Vale is no longer a valley and in fact has become an area of great volcanic activity.$B$BSalsbury here has configured a device that will allow us to ascend the volcano. Use it to get to the top and assess the goings on.$B$BI will keep in touch with this Gnomecorder device, which Salsbury has so kindly gifted upon me.</Description>
