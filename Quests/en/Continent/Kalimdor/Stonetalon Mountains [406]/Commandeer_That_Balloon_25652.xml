Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to RUN FOR MY LIFE!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ride the Krom'gar Hot Air Balloon and attempt to stop it from destroying Windshear Hold.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Amazing story, $g lad:lass;. I'd have never believed you had I not seen it with my own eyes. You did enough damage to that balloon to make those fiends pull back! Alas, the threat is far from over. We have only delayed the attack. There is much work to do if we are to stop the Horde from destroying Stonetalon!</RewardText>
