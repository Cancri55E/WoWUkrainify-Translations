  <Title>A Special Kind of Job</Title>
  <Description>You've done an admirable job down here, $n. Force Commander Valen has taken notice and requested that you see him immediately. He's got a special mission lined up for you - one that'll hopefully put a cold stop on the Horde's incursion into Stonetalon.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Report to Force Commander Valen at Northwatch Expedition Base Camp in Stonetalon Mountains.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I knew that you'd be a special snowflake when I first set my eyes upon you, $n. So special, in fact, that I'd trust no one else here with what I'm about to ask of you.</RewardText>
