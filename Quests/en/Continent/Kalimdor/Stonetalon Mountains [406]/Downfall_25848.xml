Camp Aparaje was burned to the ground and all Grimtotem in the area incinerated.$B$BNow the Horde have four of their most fearsome generals commanding the battle for Greatwood Vale, including the mag'har, General Glubgok.$B$BYou must travel to the ruins of Camp Aparaje, south of here, and kill the generals. We stop the Horde NOW! Return to me with their mark!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill the Horde generals at Camp Aparaje and recover the Insignia of the Horde General.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Are the generals dead?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Grundig crushes the insignia in his massive fist.&gt;$B$BYes, ally, you have done it! It will take Hellscream weeks to recover from this blow. Southern Stonetalon belongs to the Grimtotem... and the Alliance, of course.</RewardText>
