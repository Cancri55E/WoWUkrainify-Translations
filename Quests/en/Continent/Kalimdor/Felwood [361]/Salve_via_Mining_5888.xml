  <Title>Salve via Mining</Title>
  <Description />
  <CompletionText>If you possess a Cenarion beacon while mining in Felwood, you will be able to see tainted vitriol that corrupts a vein of raw metal.  I know how to purify that vitriol and turn it into a reagent that goes into making Cenarion plant salve.  You will then use that salve on plants you find in the wild that need saving.$B$BIf you have collected any tainted vitriol, I'll give you some Cenarion plant salve I have already prepared.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Very well then, here's some Cenarion plant salve. If you find more vitriol when you mine in Felwood, remember to hold on to it for me! The more of it you find, the more salve I will be able to make.</RewardText>
