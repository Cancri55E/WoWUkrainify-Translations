  <Title>Squirrely Clean</Title>
  <Description>The larger animals are often too far corrupted to save, but you'd be surprised how hardy the little ones are.$B$BTake the squirrels, for example. After washing in corrupted water, they can spread illness far from the original source, but it's slow to affect the squirrels themselves. In fact, a simple washing will result in a clean squirrel and a safer forest!$B$BHere, take this bottle of cleaning mixture. Grab and scrub any squirrel you see in the woods to the south... they'll be thankful for it!</Description>
