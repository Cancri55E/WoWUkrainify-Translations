  <Title>Turn It Off! Turn It Off!</Title>
  <Description>It was those darn worgen! They blew right past me into the cavern.$B$BThey must've messed with the Master Control Pump! If that thing is left on too long, every pipe runnin' under our feet is gonna blow. You think the leaks now are bad? Just wait!$B$BListen, if you can reach the Master Control Pump all the way in the back of the cavern, you can shut it off and save us all!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Shut off the Master Control Pump at the bottom of Irontree Cavern.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You turn the largest handle you can find on the Master Control Pump, and the rattling noises in the nearby pipes stop.$B$BThis gives you a few moments to hear the sound of flames outside before a familiar voice cuts in through a tinny, crackling speaker.</RewardText>
