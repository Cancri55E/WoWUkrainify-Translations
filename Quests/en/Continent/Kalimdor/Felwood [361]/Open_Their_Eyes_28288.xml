  <Title>Open Their Eyes</Title>
  <Description>Before you go...$B$BI've taken advantage of my "alone time" with Impsy here to learn some interesting facts about imps. Specifically, he ended up telling me the one thing that all imps fear most. Something they're absolutely terrified of.$B$BI thought that sounded useful as well as interesting, so I've done some basic conjuring. This prism will project an image of... well, of what Impsy described.$B$BShadowlurk Ridge is still swarming with imps. Why don't you go test their reaction for me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Delaris's Prism to terrify 20 Jadefire Imps.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Having fun?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I see... their eyes are open$B$B&lt;Delaris smiles with bemusement.&gt;$B$BMaybe I'll keep Impsy around after all. He's got a lot to teach me...</RewardText>
