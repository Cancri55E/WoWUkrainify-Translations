  <Title>Weeding the Lawn</Title>
  <Description>In a place like this, even something as simple as growing flowers and pulling weeds can require some heroic effort.$B$BThe orchid lashers that grow on all sides of the grove are a sign of healing. But they're not flawless; some of them do succumb to demonic corruption now and then.$B$BI've found the best way to check is to just pull them up. If they're normal, they'll wander around a bit and reroot themselves. If they aren't... well, you'd better be ready for a fight!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Pull up 7 Whisperwind Lashers to check them for corruption.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Checking the lashers will really help me here.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It's hard work, but it's so rewarding when you see them growing up big and strong.$B$BWhen they're not covered with demonic thorns, that is!</RewardText>
