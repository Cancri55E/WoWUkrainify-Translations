  <Title>Salve via Gathering</Title>
  <Description />
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Maybess Riverbreeze in Felwood.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <CompletionText>A Cenarion beacon allows a seasoned herbalist to spot insidious fel creep - a malfeasant product of Felwood's corruption. My work here has taught me the knowledge of purifying fel creep into a cleansing reagent... used in what we now refer to as Cenarion plant salve.$b$bWhen you gather herbs in Felwood, you should encounter the fel creep so long as you have the beacon. In exchange for what you bring to me, I will give you pre-made Cenarion plant salve.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent work $n - every bit of this, once we purify it, will help us take back Felwood. Here, take some doses of Cenarion plant salve and head into the forest. The reclaiming of the land from the corruption waits for no $r!</RewardText>
