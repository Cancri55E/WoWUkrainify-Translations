  <Title>Wisps of the Woods</Title>
  <Description>I have toiled long here with the Denmother to spread the teachings of Cenarius and the ways of the wild. She has gained much of my trust, and in return, I have been allowed to introduce the spirits of the forest to her students. The company of wisps is a great honor, as well as a useful blessing.$B$BBut now the goblins descend on us, and seek to steal the wisps for nefarious use. Please, prevent this blasphemy!$B$BCall the wisps back here from the western woods with this blessed branch, and keep them safe.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Swiftwind Switch to collect 5 Talonbranch Wisps.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $n. Now the Horde will not be able to defile these poor spirits to aid their brutish ways.</RewardText>
