  <Title>Salve via Disenchanting</Title>
  <Description />
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Arathandris Silversky in Felwood.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <CompletionText>The power of a disenchanted magical item is felt by the essence it creates. I've devised a way to turn raw essence used by enchanters into a suitable reagent for creating Cenarion plant salve. You don't need a Cenarion beacon for this; any suitably disenchanted item that yields lesser nether essences will work.$b$bI just need a single lesser nether essence; in exchange, I will give you Cenarion plant salves. The essence is extremely potent - a little definitely goes a long way!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Here are some Cenarion plant salves - I only need one lesser nether essence for this, $n. Essence is by far the most potent item I can make use of to turn swords into plowshares, as it were. If you need more salve, then find me here!</RewardText>
