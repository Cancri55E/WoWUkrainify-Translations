  <Title>It's Time to Oil Up</Title>
  <Description>Three things come out of Irontree Clearing: lumber, oil, and exhausted workers. The first two are pretty much the cause of the third, but I like to be efficient about things where I can.$B$BI've got our shredders working triple unpaid overtime, and there's really nowhere in the schedule for them to get maintenance.$B$BUse this grappling hook to nab some of the extra oil cans floating around camp and use them to oil up the shredders, would you?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Darla's Grapple to collect Irontree Oil Cans and use them to oil 7 Irontree Shredders.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>So why are you sticking around here wasting my time?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Efficiency in the workforce! Wonderful.$B$BMaybe I should check on the goblins inside those shredders later.</RewardText>
