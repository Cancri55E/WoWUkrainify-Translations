  <Title>Touch the Untouchable</Title>
  <Description>I've added a drop of my very own essence to the ooze. Look for a glowing sigil to the west, at the edge of Shadowlurk Ridge. Stand on it, concentrate, and pour this stuff all over yourself. It should be enough to shift you into the nether and let you see what's REALLY there.$B$BYou won't be alone... the satyr's treasure is being guarded by the biggest voidstalker they could summon. Defeat him, and the treasure is yours.$B$BAnd come back in one piece, or this crazy broad's gonna fry me!</Description>

  <LogDescription>Use the Phaseblood Potion at the Sigil of Tichondrius to shift into the nether, and search for the Claw of Tichondrius.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Can you hear me in there, $n? Do you have the claw?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The Claw of Tichondrius...$B$BYou hold a piece of the very demon that led the Legion to these woods, $n. Better for it to be in our hands than with the satyr.$B$BHold still. I'm going to pull you back to our plane and make sure you and the claw arrive here safely...</RewardText>
