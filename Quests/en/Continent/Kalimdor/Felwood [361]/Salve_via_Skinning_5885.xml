  <Title>Salve via Skinning</Title>
  <Description />
  <CompletionText>A Cenarion beacon will allow a well-trained skinner to spot patches of tainted skin from bounty gathered in Felwood. I convert these seemingly useless patches into a thick paste that serves as a quickening agent for Cenarion plant salve. When you skin your kills here in Felwood, be sure to have a beacon on you!$b$bWhen you collect tainted patches, bring them to me and I will give you some Cenarion plant salves that I have already made.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is exactly what I need. Here - take these plant salves and use them to reclaim Felwood from the corruption. We must persevere, $n!</RewardText>
