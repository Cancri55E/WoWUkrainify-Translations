  <Title>Corrupted Whipper Root</Title>
  <Description />
  <CompletionText>You have found a sickly, corrupted version of what appears to be a whipper root plant. The visible roots of the plant appear tough and leathery, and a slimy film hangs from the plant. It desperately needs some sort of attention if it is to be turned back to normal.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You apply 3 Cenarion Plant Salves to the Whipper Root. It immediately begins to shed its corrupted form, blossoming into a vibrant and healthy plant.</RewardText>
