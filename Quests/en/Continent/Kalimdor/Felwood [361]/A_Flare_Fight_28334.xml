  <Title>A Flare Fight</Title>
  <Description>This operation's stayed pretty discreet so far, but the worgen over in Talonbranch Glade have it out for us. They've been trying everything they can to get us shut down.$B$BSome of the workers have told me they've seen glimpses of worgen lurking around the clearing. Take these oversized megaflares. They're bright enough to show anything that gets anywhere near them.$B$BUse the flares to look for prowling worgen, and make sure they don't leave here alive!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Darla's Box of Megaflares to reveal 8 Talonbranch Prowlers and slay them.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Careful with those flares now, don't want any workplace incidents.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Mangy curs think they can just waltz in here and ruin my finely-tuned operation. Hah!$B$BI told you not to look directly at the flares, right? Oops.</RewardText>
