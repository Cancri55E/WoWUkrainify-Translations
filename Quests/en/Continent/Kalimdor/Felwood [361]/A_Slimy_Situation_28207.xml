  <Description>This poor fellow here barely escaped Bloodvenom Post with his life! If we're going to keep him from turning into a slime creature like all the others, we've got to treat the infection.$B$BMushrooms like to grow near the bright green waters around here, like the pond to the east beneath the falls. Most of them are no good... I need you to collect the bright green glowing ones!$B$BIf I have those, I'll be able to whip up something tasty to help this poor tauren. Don't take too long now!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 7 Emerald Shimmercaps.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Remember, it's the bright green glowing ones!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Most people think the green glow is demonic corruption... but if you've got an eye for shades and hues like me, you can tell it's the energies of the emerald dream! These little guys aren't being corrupted by the waters, they're doing their best to purify it!$B$BNow we'll mash 'em up and make a nice yummy paste for Mr. Tauren to eat and feel all better.</RewardText>
