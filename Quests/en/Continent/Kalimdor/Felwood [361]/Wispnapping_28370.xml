  <Title>Wisp-napping</Title>
  <Description>Can you believe these worgen here have wisps?  The night elves showed them all that druid junk and now they've got their precious little wisps too, giving them all the building material they want without having to harm any precious trees.$B$BIf we had those things, we could pull extra wood out of every tree in our site. Free resources, free profit! That's why I've been working on this containment device.$B$BHead to Talonbranch Glade and use it to steal some wisps. Just point and press the button.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Darla's Wisp Magnet to collect 5 Talonbranch Wisps.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did it work? Are they still in the jar?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Pretty little things, aren't they? I wonder if we can figure out how to make more of them.</RewardText>
