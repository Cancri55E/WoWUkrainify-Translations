  <Title>Deadwood Ritual Totem</Title>
  <Description>You have found one of the Deadwood furbolg's ritual totems.  The totem itself is of non-descript construction, but a palpable sense of despair emanates from it.  If there were any object that might best exemplify the corruption that the Deadwood furbolg suffer under, this item would clearly be it.$B$BOne of the furbolgs inside Timbermaw Hold may have a use for such an item... that is, if you've earned their trust enough for them to speak with you.

  <LogDescription>Take the Deadwood Ritual Totem inside Timbermaw Hold and see if one of the furbolgs there will find a use for the item.  The Timbermaw will not speak with you unless you are of Neutral reputation or greater with them.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Yes $c, what can I assist you with?  You walk among us peacefully, though there is assuredly something amiss.  I sense something... something troubling...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This totem... I recognize it as one of the Deadwood's, but it is thick with the stench of decay.  Whatever foulness has turned our brethren against us is surely present in this object.$B$BYou were wise to bring this to us, $n.  Perhaps through study and ritual, we can uncover what it is that pollutes the minds of our brethren.  Thank you, friend - please accept these offerings in exchange for your find.</RewardText>
