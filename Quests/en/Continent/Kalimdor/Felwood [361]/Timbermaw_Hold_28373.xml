  <Title>Timbermaw Hold</Title>
  <Description>Okay, I know this is a longshot, but I figure it never hurts to ask.$B$BWhile I deal with the fallout of all the ridiculous nonsense that just went on here, I need you to go speak to some bears. The Timbermaw furbolg control the forests to the northeast, and they're not too fond of us.$B$BI just need someone to give them the idea the Horde isn't all that bad. Head northeast up the road to Timbermaw Hold--don't go into Felpaw Village--and ask the furbolg outside if they have any favors they'd like done.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Nafien at Timbermaw Hold in Felwood. Timbermaw Hold is to the east, past Felpaw Village.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We furbolg are not foolish, $n. We will not yield Timbermaw Hold to any askers.$B$BHowever, we are also in dire need of assistance. If you help us, we will grant you our favor and allow you passage.</RewardText>
