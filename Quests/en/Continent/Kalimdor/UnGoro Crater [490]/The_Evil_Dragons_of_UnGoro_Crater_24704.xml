  <Title>The Evil Dragons of Un'Goro Crater</Title>
  <Description>This crater is filled with a malignant breed of dragon.  Have you seen them?  They wander all about, parading their spiky backs and lizardy faces all around the Crater.$b$bDon't let them fool you, squire, for these dragons are no minions of graceful Alexstrasza.  They are clearly vicious, and direly in need of a hero's blade.$b$bI have decided that I will slay no less than 15 of them.  As my squire, you must come along.  Should we become separated, you may meet me back here at the Hot Springs.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Maximillian of Northshire slay 15 "Dragons".</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I've not yet meted enough justice, squire.  You may complain to me only when 15 of the beasts are slayed.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>...and that makes 15 of them.$b$bJustice had a name today... and that name was Maximillian of Northshire.  For Doloria!</RewardText>
