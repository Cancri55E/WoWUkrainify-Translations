  <Title>Gormashh the Glutinous</Title>
  <Description>Hey, I know!  We've been looking at the wrong tar creatures.$b$bGremix once told me about a larger-than-normal tar creature that he ran into.  It lurks around the tar pit far to the east of here, south of Fungal Rock.  I'll bet that the bigger these creatures get, the stickier they get!  We'll make some money yet, $n!$b$bDon't forget the scraper!</Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>Gormashh</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>If you can help it, try not to touch him while you're slaying him.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Kill Gormashh and obtain the Unbelievably Sticky Tar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I'm counting on you, $n.  I'm invested pretty heavily into this "tar as glue" scheme, and it'd be a shame if you came back empty-handed.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Yes, this tar is just the stuff...$B$BHey, wait a minute, my hands... I can't seem to get them apart...$B$BMaybe this wasn't such a good idea. Oh, but wait! Super sticky tar remover! That's where the real money is!</RewardText>
