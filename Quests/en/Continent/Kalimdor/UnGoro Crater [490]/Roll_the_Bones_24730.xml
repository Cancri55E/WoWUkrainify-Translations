  <Title>Roll the Bones</Title>
  <Description>You'd think that being chief digger for Marshal Expeditions means I like digging.  There might be worse things to do in this world... but none really leap to mind.$B$BWe were supposed to be digging in Terror Run - FANTASTIC name by the way - for dead stegodons and diemetradons.  Well, there are plenty of live ones there too!  Wil and Hol are still all about studying this death trap, so we need those dinosaur bones.  Between you and me though, bringing some from live ones will work out just as well.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 8 Dinosaur Bones.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Think whatever you want of me, but they're not going to care if the bones they get to research are from ancient stegodons and diemetradons or the ones that almost devoured us wholesale when we were trying to set up our camps.  I'll just be happy if we get out of here alive...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent, these should do the trick.  And now, if you'll permit me, in case anyone's listening...$B$BTHANKS FOR DIGGING ALL OF THESE BONES OUT OF THE GROUND FOR US AND NOT HURTING THE NATIVE BEASTS IN ANY WAY.$B$BWhether you really did or didn't, I don't want to know.  Let's keep it that way, shall we?  Here - maybe this will keep your lips shut on the whole thing.  Anything to get out of here alive, I say!</RewardText>
