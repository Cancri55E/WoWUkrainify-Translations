  <Title>Volcanic Activity</Title>
  <Description>Welcome.  I'm Williden Marshal, and my sister and I run this expedition of explorers and scientists.  You have a moment?$b$bI don't like the look of those elementals on that volcano, $c.  We have too much equipment, too many notes... one crazed elemental could streak its way through our camp and do terrible, terrible damage.$b$bShow them that their new neighbors aren't to be trifled with.  And bring back the ash that they leave behind... we might as well do a little science while we're at it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 9 samples of Un'Goro Ash from the fire elementals around the volcano in Un'Goro Crater.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you think the volcano is active?  I wonder why it didn't explode when the cataclysm hit.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I hope that did the trick.  I'll take the ash... this may come in handy sometime down the line.</RewardText>
