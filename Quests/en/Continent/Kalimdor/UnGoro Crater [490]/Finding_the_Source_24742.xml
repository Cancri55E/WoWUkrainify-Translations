  <Title>Finding the Source</Title>
  <Description>I created a thermometer to take readings of the temperatures at the volcano, and I'd like to find the hottest lava flows.  It gives the measurements in degrees Kraklenheit!$B$BHere, take it, and take readings of the temperatures at the ridge whenever you see a hot spot!$b$bHot spots usually take the form of a glowing, rocky pillar jutting out of the ground.  You'll find them around the base of Fire Plume Ridge... one trip around the perimeter will likely suffice.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Krakle in Un'Goro Crater wants you to find the hottest area of Fire Plume Ridge.$B$BWhenever you find a hot spot, use the thermometer to check the temperature. Keep looking until you find the hottest one.</LogDescription>
