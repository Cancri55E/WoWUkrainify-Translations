  <Title>Bouquets of Death</Title>
  <Description>You're already familiar with the first phase of the Bloodpetals' life cycle: the waterborne seed.  The next phase, however, is not so docile: the pack of juveniles.$b$bWhen Bloodpetals hatch, they quickly form gangs and travel together, offsetting their weakness with overwhelming numbers.  These packs of young lashers normally keep to themselves, but upset one of them and you upset them all.$b$bFor our safety and the safety of others, dispose of them.  They roam close by, to the west and north.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 6 packs of Juvenile Lashers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Remember the tale of Archimonde, $c.  The young lashers are much weaker than you, but they can still overrun you with their numbers.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You return victorious.  Good, good... perhaps the crater will now be a bit safer to those who travel through it.</RewardText>
