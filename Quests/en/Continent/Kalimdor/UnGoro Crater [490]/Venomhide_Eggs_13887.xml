  <Title>Venomhide Eggs</Title>
  <Description>Now that you've built up an immunity to venomhide toxin, you can safely handle the animals and their eggs. Venomhides are vicious and must be trained from the moment they hatch.$B$BIf you want to ride one, you'll need an unhatched egg. Scattered throughout the Marshlands are a number of ravasaur nests. Look for the eggs with lighter colored shells -- those are the ones that will hatch venomhides.$B$BIf you bring me several of the eggs, I'll allow you to keep one and raise its hatchling, with my guidance.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 4 Venomhide Ravasaur Eggs to Mor'vek in the southeast part of the Marshlands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find those eggs?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good work. Honestly, I'm amazed you were able to find this many. With each clutch, they seem fewer in number.$B$BI'll let you raise one of the freshly-hatched venomhides. It shouldn't be shy about letting you know what it needs.</RewardText>
