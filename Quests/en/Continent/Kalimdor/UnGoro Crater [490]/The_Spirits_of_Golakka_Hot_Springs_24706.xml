  <Title>The Spirits of Golakka Hot Springs</Title>
  <Description>A moment of seriousness now, $n.  We have an important quest ahead of us.  The treacherous dragons that plague this valley will not cease their mischief until we destroy their repugnant brood mother.  Before we even attempt to complete such a task, we must ask the Light for aid.$b$bI have seen the Light manifest itself nearby, in the form of Spirits floating by the shores of Golakka Hot Springs.  Come, I must speak with them, and ask them for aid.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Stand by as Maximillian of Northshire speaks to 2 Steam Furies.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We have not completed our prayers.  Shall I join you?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Might I ask you a question?  What act have you committed to make the spirits so angry at you?  I'm impressed that you had the patience to sit so still while they pummeled you so violently.$b$bNow we may proceed.  The teeth and scales of Un'Goro's greatest dragon await us.</RewardText>
