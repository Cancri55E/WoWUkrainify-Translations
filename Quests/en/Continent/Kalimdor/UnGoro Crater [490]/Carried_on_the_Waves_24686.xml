  <Title>Carried on the Waves</Title>
  <Description>The Bloodpetals of Un'Goro have a fascinating life cycle.$b$bThese trees in front of us bear seeds that fall down into the river when they mature.  The river's current then takes the seed north of here, where the seed hatches - almost like an egg - and a newborn Bloodpetal emerges.$b$bI require these seeds for my studies.  Take this net, and use it to scoop up the bright orange seeds in the river.  You'll have to hunt them down under the water.</Description>
