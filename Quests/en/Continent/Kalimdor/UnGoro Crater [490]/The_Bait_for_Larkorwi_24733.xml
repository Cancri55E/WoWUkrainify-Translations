  <Title>The Bait for Lar'korwi</Title>
  <Description>This will be the most difficult part because there is some complexity to the plan.  Continue following the river to the north, and look for a bend in the river.  It was here I saw Lar'korwi last.  You will know you are in the right area because of all the bones from massive creatures that once wandered nearby.$b$bTake the meat you recovered and place it there.  Then, rub this mixture I created on the meat.$b$bIf both lures mingled together do not bring Lar'korwi to you, then I know nothing else that will.</Description>
