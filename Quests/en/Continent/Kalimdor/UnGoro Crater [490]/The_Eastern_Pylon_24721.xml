  <Title>The Eastern Pylon</Title>
  <Description>High up in the cliffs above me there is a large crystal pylon.  Who placed it there, I cannot say, nor can I determine any reason that it would be built in such a strange place.$b$bMaybe you can make more of it than I can.  I personally don't care what it does, so you needn't report back to me, but perhaps one of the scholars in Marshal's Stand might be interested in what you discover.</Description>
