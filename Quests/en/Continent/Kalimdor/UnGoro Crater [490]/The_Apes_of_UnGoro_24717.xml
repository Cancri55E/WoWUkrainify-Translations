  <Title>The Apes of Un'Goro</Title>
  <Description>There's plenty of money to be had here in Un'Goro, you just need to know where to look!$b$bApes may be common here in Un'Goro, but they're much rarer up north.  In Everlook, a gorilla hide fetches ten times what you'll get for it down here!$b$bI'm not going to send you all the way up to Winterspring - that'd be irresponsible - but I could use your help actually obtaining some hides.$b$bYou'll find gorillas at Fungal Rock, to the northeast, near a waterfall.  Don't forget to check inside the cave!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 2 Un'Goro Gorilla Pelts, 2 Un'Goro Stomper Pelts, and 2 Un'Goro Thunderer Pelts to Gremix at Mossy Pile.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I never know what style is in vogue, so I'll want a few different colors.  Try to get hides from each different type of gorilla there.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Wow, 2 of each color!  You're certainly an overachiever, $n.  My companions and I could use a $r like you around here.  Ever consider a career in profiteering?</RewardText>
