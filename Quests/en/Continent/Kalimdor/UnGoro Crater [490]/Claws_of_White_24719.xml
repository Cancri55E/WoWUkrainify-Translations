  <Title>Claws of White</Title>
  <Description>Stop, $r.  I could use the help of a $c like you.$b$bRight outside this camp, there are raptors with deadly claws.  I've been using the claws for druid rituals, but it doesn't seem to be working.  However, I did notice that some of those raptors sometimes have white claws, when most have deathly black ones.$b$bThe earth works in strange ways.  Maybe you could fetch me some of the white claws, and I'll try one last time?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 5 White Ravasaur Claws.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you gotten any of the claws yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>My mentor says that sometimes you have to take away from nature before you can give back.  These raptors... I feel that they died for good cause.$b$bThank you, $n.</RewardText>
