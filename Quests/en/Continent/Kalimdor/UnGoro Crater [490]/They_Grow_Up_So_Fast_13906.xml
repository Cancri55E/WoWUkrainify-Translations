  <Title>They Grow Up So Fast</Title>
  <Description>With your expert feeding and care, your venomhide hatchling will grow quickly. As they grow, their hatchling teeth will be replaced by adult teeth. If you keep the teeth shed by your hatchling as it grows, you'll have an easy way to tell when it's mature enough to be trained as a mount.$B$BYour venomhide will let you know what it needs, so pay close attention. When it has shed all of its baby teeth, return to me with your venomhide and the materials for your saddle and I'll do the rest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return 20 Venomhide Baby Teeth,  the Venomhide Hatchling, 20 Runecloth, 20 Rugged Leather, and 80 gold to Mor'vek in the southeastern part of the Marshlands in Un'Goro Crater.</LogDescription>

I've trained your venomhide ravasaur to respond when you blow this whistle.$b$bFew have the dedication to hand-feed and raise a venomhide, but they're well worth the effort.</RewardText>
