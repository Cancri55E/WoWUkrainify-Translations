  <Title>Super Sticky</Title>
  <Description>I'm always looking for a quick way to earn a gold, $n. If you help me with my newest idea, I'll let you in on a little of the profit. How does that sound to you?$B$BI thought so!$B$BWe're going to be making some glue. Head to the tar pits just north of here, and collect me some tar. Not just any tar, now, you'll need to get it from the beasts that live around the tar pits. As a bonus, if you use my tar scraper on their corpses, you'll keep your hands nice and clean.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 samples of Super Sticky Tar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Tara's done it again -- this super sticky glue will be all the rage!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Yeah, this tar is pretty sticky, I guess.  I mean, it's sticky, but it's not "make fistfuls of money" sticky.  I guess I'll have to keep thinking.</RewardText>
