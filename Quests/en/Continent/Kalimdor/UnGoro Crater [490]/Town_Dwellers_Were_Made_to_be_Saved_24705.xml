  <Title>Town Dwellers Were Made to be Saved</Title>
  <Description>I've a feeling that we may find more than dragons here in this crater.  My paladin's instinct tells me that there are townsfolk nearby that require our aid. Those in distress cannot be ignored.$b$bLet us sally forth, Squire $n!  The people of Un'Goro require our aid!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rescue the Dweller by the Shore, the Dweller in the Cliffs, and the Dweller of the North.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Our duty is fulfilled.  Even so, it troubles me that today's damsels were less than gracious... only the fair-haired one by the lake managed to show us any gratitude for our chivalry.  Perhaps tomorrow's damsels will have thankfulness to match their beauty.$b$bNow we must ride.  More adventures await!</RewardText>
