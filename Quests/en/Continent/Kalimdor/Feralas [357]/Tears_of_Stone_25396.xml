  <Description>As you witnessed, the dragon Ysondre has told us that the tears of the land can seal the portal from which this corruption stems.$B$BHer words ring true; in the glade to the west, I have seen the mountain giants distraught. They raged in frustration and wept, and their tears fell upon the stones as shining crystals.$B$BThough the giants weep no more, these stonetears must be what Ysondre referred to. We must gather them.</Description>
