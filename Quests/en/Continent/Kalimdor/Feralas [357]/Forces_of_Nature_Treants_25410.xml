  <Title>Forces of Nature: Treants</Title>
  <Description>Some people think treants are good for little more than fetching drinks in a war. Most of them haven't seen an entire defensive line scattered by what they thought was cover.$B$BAnd have you ever seen a peon try to chop one down and get surprised? I was in tears...$B$BAt any rate, they're immensely valuable allies. You'll find some wandering just outside  the Tower of Estulan and more in forest to the east, just southeast of Dire Maul. Be on the lookout for the Horde!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Tessina's Whistle to rally 6 Wandering Forest Walkers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>They may not look it, but some treants grow to be ancient protectors. We could use a few more of those around here...</RewardText>
