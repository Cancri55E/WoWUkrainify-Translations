  <CompletionText>Welcome back $n - were you able to find some tangible evidence as to the plans of the gnolls?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah, this is exactly what we needed.  While I am not so skilled at ciphering what most of the scrawling on this map is, I've seen enough battle plans in my day to understand what is happening with the gnolls.  It looks like they are currently fighting a two front war.  One is with us... but it seems that their main energy has been against a foe to their south.$B$BThere's more at hand here than meets the eye.  Perhaps it is time to figure out who this other foe they face really is.</RewardText>
