  <Title>Improved Quality</Title>
  <Description>It's funny how things change. The northern yetis used to yield the best hides, but these...there's been a decline in quality, it seems. Maybe something nearby is making them sick.$B$BLuckily, the Feral Scar yetis to the southeast have flourished. I bet their hides are even better than they used to be!$B$BI would reward you handsomely for a stack of ten of their hides; bring them to me here, and we'll finish our business.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Feral Scar Yeti Hides.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>These hides may not be as resilient as thorium, but they're nice and supple.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent, excellent!  These are going to work out incredibly well - I can already tell that they're going to be much harder when properly cured.$B$BThanks again for your help $n.  Here - please take one of my latest creations.</RewardText>
