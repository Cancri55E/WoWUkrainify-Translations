  <Title>Even More Fuel for the Zapping</Title>
  <Description>If I bet against my own better judgment and stay to run an engineering shop along the Forgotten Coast, I will need to deal with these pesky elementals.  Curse the powers of elementalism unchecked, I say!$B$BFortunately for me, and now for you my hopeful agent provocateur, the elementals represent an ideal source of raw power for my Ultra-Shrinker refinement - give them the what-for I say!  When doing this though, be sure to save me the water elemental cores!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Water Elemental Cores from the Sea Elementals and Sea Sprays.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>While I could bore you with the technical details of the utility behind elemental cores, I will instead tempt you to completion of this important task by offering valuable coin and prizes for doing so.  Yon verily, are you finished?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Scrumdillyriffic!  These cores will keep me working for some time.  Add to that the benefit of there now being fewer elementals along the coast, and I might no longer cry myself to sleep at the prospect of having set up shop in perhaps the worst place imaginable!$B$BThank you, $n, for your efforts on my behalf.  While it certainly straps me financially to do this, allow me to show you some gratitude you may understand and appreciate... loot!</RewardText>
