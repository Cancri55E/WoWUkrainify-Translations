  <Description>The mountain giants are our most powerful allies of the forest. They're carved from the land itself.$B$BNot many of our enemies are willing to fight off a walking hillside. It only takes a few of these to turn the tide of a battle completely.$B$BThe mountain giants here have been afflicted by some illness lately, but I've seen a healthy group of them to the southwest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Jesana's Giant Call to rally 5 Mountain Giants.</LogDescription>
