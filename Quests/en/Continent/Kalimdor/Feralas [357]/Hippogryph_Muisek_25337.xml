  <Title>Hippogryph Muisek</Title>
  <Description>The next step is hippogryphs.$B$BAs Master Uzer'i always said, hippogryphs have been loyal companions to the night elves for many years, an' their spirits are loyal and steadfast.$B$BI don't think they'll miss a few, and I don't care if they do. We need the muisek of 10 frayfeather hippogyphs in the wilderness to the south.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Frayfeather Hippogryphs of any type, then use the Muisek Vessel to shrink and capture them.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to capture the hippogryphs?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Master always said "after killing an animal, if we allowed the muisek to escape, it may take the form of an even greater creature." This is dangerous stuff. Thanks for helping me with my studies.</RewardText>
