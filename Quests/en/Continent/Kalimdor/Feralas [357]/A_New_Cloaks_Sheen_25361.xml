  <Title>A New Cloak's Sheen</Title>
  <Description>Well met, $c. I've traveled with my companions down to Feralas on a mission for our Orgrimmar masters.$B$BMy life-mate Korrin finds great pleasure in new clothing, so I aim to make her a new cloak adorned with the gossamer wings of faerie dragons. Would you be able to help me? Sprite darters with the gorgeous wings I want are west of Camp Mojache.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 10 Iridescent Sprite Darter Wings to Krueg Skullsplitter in Camp Mojache.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The sprite darters can be dangerous critters when provoked. Be careful when dealing with them, $c. And be even more careful of any night elves in the area. The pestering fools tend to hold up in the forests also.$B$BWhen you've gotten enough of the wings, let me know, I'll be sure to reward you well!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Wonderful, $c! These will do nicely. There are enough here to make a cloak for Korrin, and possibly even more! Thank you.$B$BI hope the trip wasn't too dangerous? The area of Feralas is not known for being forgiving, but you've obviously done well enough.$B$BThank you again, $c.</RewardText>
