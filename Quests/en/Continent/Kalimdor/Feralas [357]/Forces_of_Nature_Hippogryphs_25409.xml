  <Title>Forces of Nature: Hippogryphs</Title>
  <Description>Hippogryphs are majestic creatures. Some say they were created by Cenarius himself as a gift for the night elves. They're wary of other races, but they're intelligent enough to recognize a friend of a friend.$B$BI need more hippogryphs here so we can begin training some of our newer archers to ride them. Take the whistle again and rally the Frayfeather hippogyphs in the grove just south of the Tower of Estulan.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Tessina's Whistle to rally 10 Frayfeather Hippogryphs.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>A properly trained squadron of hippogryph riders can take on nearly any opposing force. Feathermoon Stronghold will be much safer with these noble beasts on our side.</RewardText>
