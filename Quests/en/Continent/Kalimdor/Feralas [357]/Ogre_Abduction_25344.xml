  <Description>There's no way the Gordunni made these. They're being supplied. Someone is giving them gifts of power, and we need to find out who.$B$BThe upper-class Gordok that guard Dire Maul will know more about this. Orhan is no doubt having you thin their numbers, but I'll need one alive.$B$BTake the orb back. It's similar to a Soulstone, so I've made some...adjustments. Hold it up in front of a weakened Gordok ogre, and once you've captured him, bring it back here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Modified Soulstone to capture a Gordok ogre.</LogDescription>
