  <Title>Forces of Nature: Faerie Dragons</Title>
  <Description>You wouldn't know it from looking at them, but the lovely faerie dragons that inhabit this forest can be truly fearsome if trained properly. They can do amazing things to magical energy...absorb it, redirect it, even nullify it entirely.$B$BThey're nearly harmless alone, but in large numbers, they can have a stunning effect on a battle. You can find some in the fields to the northwest, but be careful, the Horde is nearby.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Jesana's Faerie Dragon Call to rally 10 Sprite Dragons or Sprite Darters.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Aren't they adorable? The babies are even cuter.</RewardText>
