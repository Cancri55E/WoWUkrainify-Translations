  <Title>Forces of Nature: Wisps</Title>
  <Description>The Sentinels make up the bulk of our forces here, but a well-rounded night elf army requires more than just night elves. The creatures of this forest, our ancestral home, have protected us for centuries. We simply need to rally them.$B$BTake this whistle. Our allies know this sound, and you'll be using it to recall them.$B$BBefore you start gathering creatures, I'd like you to recall a few of our wisps, just for practice. You can find them just outside the fortress, among the trees.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Tessina's Whistle to recall 3 Feathermoon Wisps.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Wisps have always lived in harmony with night elves, and we depend on them for many things. These little guys you sent back, for example, will be helping us with some new construction and repairs.$B$BReady for more?</RewardText>
