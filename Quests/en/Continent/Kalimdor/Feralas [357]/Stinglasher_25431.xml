  <Title>Stinglasher</Title>
  <Description>Most of the insects we've seen wandering the hive have been enormous enough, but my scouts reported an especially huge one. It's supposedly a massive wasp, and it seemed to be directing the workers on the surface.$B$BI don't know much about these things, but if they're starting to wander beyond that pit in the ground, we need to put a stop to it. Kill this giant wasp and return to me.</Description>
