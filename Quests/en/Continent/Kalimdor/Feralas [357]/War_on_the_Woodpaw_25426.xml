  <Title>War on the Woodpaw</Title>
  <Description>The first of Shandris's direct orders is to deal with the Woodpaw gnolls here. They've been spreading too far, too fast, and are becoming a threat to both the forest and our war effort.$B$BThey know we're here. After we took this camp, we've been leading covert strikes against them. It's time to make a major blow; bring back ten of their manes, and we'll be ready for the next phase.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Woodpaw Gnoll Manes.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The manes aren't just for trophies. If there's to be slaughter, we may as well not let it be a total waste.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent work, $n. I didn't think those gnolls would give you much trouble.</RewardText>
