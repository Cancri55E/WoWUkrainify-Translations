  <Title>The Mark of Quality</Title>
  <Description>My philosophy on leatherworking is that the work must be the best quality possible - no compromises. Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter is trying to sell you ocean-front property in Dun Morogh!$B$BIn my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have run across thick yeti hides. The Yeti are native to Feralas, with many found in Rage Scar Hold to the northeast. I want some, and I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.  If that sounds fair, then we're in business.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Thick Yeti Hides.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>A stack of ten thick yeti hides will net you a choice of one of my crafted items.  Because I care about quality, I am able to ensure you'll get a good item!$B$B</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Did you stop and examine the texture of these hides?  Properly treated, these hides could very well be stronger than iron.  Not many people know about these hides, and that in combination with the vast treating solutions I know will allow me to potentially make items with a true mark of quality... thanks to you, of course!$B$BAnd now, please choose from what I am able to offer you for your service!</RewardText>
