  <Title>War on the Woodpaw</Title>
  <Description>The gnolls... they are more than a nuisance.  They are a constant threat to the existence of this very camp!  It is irrelevant whether they are indigenous to Feralas or not; if we do not strengthen our resolve against them, we will find ourselves driven out of the entire region.$B$BThe gnoll attacks against the camp have become more fevered as of late.  We need your aid in thinning their numbers; bring to me ten of their manes, and I will reward you handsomely for your effort.$B$BGo!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 10 Woodpaw Gnoll Manes to Hadoken Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We drive them back, and yet they still attack!  Someone or something must be driving them into a frenzy... oh, you have returned, eh $n?  Do you have the manes I require for the bounty to be met?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is proof of a good start, $n.  Your skills as a soldier are to be commended.$B$BYou are not the only one I ask that task of.  Many before you have fought them, and in times past, our efforts have kept them at bay.  Recently though, their attempts to push northward into our area of influence have increased dramatically.  Their attacks have also become more savage... almost as if they were desperate.$B$BI have a plan though, $n, that might settle things once and for all against them...</RewardText>
