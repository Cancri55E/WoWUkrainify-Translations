  <Title>Zukk'ash Infestation</Title>
  <Description>With the gnolls out of the way, we're ready to take care of other foes. Our scouts have discovered what appears to be a hive nearby, extending deep beneath the ground.$B$BThe insects of the hive are large and ferocious, and most likely pose an even greater threat than the gnolls. I want you to proceed to the hive with caution. Cut down a good portion of the bugs and bring back their carapaces for further study.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 20 Zukk'ash Carapaces.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How goes the hunt, $n?  Are you here to report your success?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These are silithid after all...I wasn't sure, having never seen one in person. Gilneas had its problems, but at least we didn't have these monstrosities running around!</RewardText>
