I have driven back the gnolls time after time from our camp, and it is only our chieftain's mercy that prevents them from being wiped out entirely.$B$BOver the years, it has fallen into a dance of strength and dominance. When their numbers surge and they threaten the camp, the alphas, the strongest gnolls, must be slain.$B$BThis will drive them back into the forest, and leave us is peace until they forget their lessons.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 5 Woodpaw Alphas.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The alphas can be found at their own camps, with the lesser gnolls surrounding the outskirts.</CompletionText>

Take this small reward as compensation for your efforts, $n.$B$BWith their numbers thinned and their leaders slain, the gnolls will think twice about storming the camp.  This doesn't conclude the issue at hand, however...$B$BThere must be some reason why the gnolls have been whipped into such a frenzied state.
