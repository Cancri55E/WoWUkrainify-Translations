  <Title>The Mark of Quality</Title>
  <Description>I take pride in my leather work, and I feel it shows; quality should never be compromised.  Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter would also have you believe that the earth does not keep secrets!$B$BIn my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have discovered thick yeti hides.  Yetis are native to Feralas, often found north of here in Rage Scar Hold.  I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.  If that is agreeable to you, then we are set!</Description>

  <RewardText>Ah, excellent!  These hides, when given a special treatment, are as resilient as iron I tell you!  It will take many tries in order to get the right mix down for the tanning, but I am confident they will bring my mark of quality to the next level.$B$BAs for you, $n... your assistance has proven invaluable to me.
