  <Title>Alpha Strike</Title>
  <Description>Never underestimate a threat. These gnolls may seem like simple brutes, but there's animal cunning even among them.$B$BThe gnolls run as a pack, and every pack has Alphas: The biggest, strongest, and most ruthless members that claw their way to dominance. They're the ones giving orders, so they're the ones we're going to slay now.$B$BThey reside mostly around the Woodpaw Den, pushing the others around. Get out there and push harder.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 5 Woodpaw Alphas.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Perfect. Any gnolls left will be simple prey, lost in the woods.$B$BHeh...here, soldier, take your reward before I get distracted. We've got other threats to deal with.</RewardText>
