  <Title>Zukk'ash Infestation</Title>
  <Description>From what scouting we have managed to muster, we believe that the foe south of the gnolls is an insect-like race.  Frankly, it is irrelevant whether or not they're sentient.  If they are driving the gnolls to frenzy against us, then they are as big of a threat - if not more - than the gnolls.$B$BDive deep into where these Zukk'ash insects dwell; it is known as the Writhing Deep.  Thin their numbers and report back to me what you find, bringing back their carapaces as evidence of your handiwork.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 20 Zukk'ash Carapaces to Hadoken Swiftstrider at Camp Mojache, Feralas.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How goes the hunt, $n?  Are you here to report your success?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $c.  Though the extensiveness of the Zukk'ash presence will not be thwarted with anything less than a full-scale invasion, you have bought us some time so we can devise a proper strategy.$B$BI will be sure to have these carapaces analyzed; we'll need to learn everything about them before we deal with what has unfortunately turned into a much larger issue than we had anticipated.</RewardText>
