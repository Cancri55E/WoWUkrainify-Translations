  <Title>Raptor Captor</Title>
  <Description>The patch of swamp to the northeast is home to a particularly nasty breed of raptors. We've lost more than one unwary soldier to them, but I think we can turn them against our Grimtotem neighbors.$B$BTake this rope and use it to capture Bloodfen raptors or Bloodfen screechers that you've subdued. I wouldn't try to capture one of the beasts until you've weakened them quite a bit in combat. It's going to be quite a struggle.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Sturdy Rope to capture 6 Bloodfen Raptors or Bloodfen Screechers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you capture those raptors?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You look a little scratched up, but nothing major. You're certainly in a lot better shape than the Grimtotems will be when our new raptor friends get done with them.</RewardText>
