  <Title>Discrediting the Deserters</Title>
  <Description>I've altered the leaflets you captured from the deserters' mercenary friends at the docks. Now, anyone who reads them will get an entirely different view of the deserters and their aims.$B$BIf we distribute these to enough of the guards, the deserters will be too embarrassed to ever reestablish their presence within our walls.$B$B&lt;Calia hands you a stack of the altered leaflets.&gt;$B$BWhy don't you get started while I plan our next move?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Distribute the Altered Leaflets to 6 Theramore Guards.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I thought I heard laughter coming from the barracks. Did you distribute those leaflets I gave you?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Calia chuckles as you describe the guards' reactions to the propaganda.&gt;$B$BJust as I'd hoped! I think it's safe to say any deserter agents who try to infiltrate Theramore will be laughed right out of town!</RewardText>
