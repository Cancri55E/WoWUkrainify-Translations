  <Title>Raze Direhorn Post!</Title>
  <Description>There's no scrying necessary to see the trouble my new "neighbors" are creating. And if this is the band that burnt down the Shady Rest Inn, as you claim, there's no reason to tolerate their presence any longer.$B$BTake this torch and raze their camp to the ground! You'll find Direhorn just to the north of my farm, near the road. You can't miss it, really, as the Grimtotems have done a splendid job of announcing their presence with those totems they favor.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Tabetha's Torch to burn the North Tent, East Tent, and the Northeast Tent at Direhorn Post.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you put that torch to good use?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I hope the Grimtotems got the message. Any attempt to return will be met with far worse than a mere torch. My apprentices and I will see to that.</RewardText>
