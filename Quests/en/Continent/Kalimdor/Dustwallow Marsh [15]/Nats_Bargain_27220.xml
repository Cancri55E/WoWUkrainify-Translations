  <Title>Nat's Bargain</Title>
  <Description>So you found a copy of Dastardly Denizens of the Deep, did you? Well, I can tell you from experience, it's all true. I've even seen a few of 'em with my own eyes.$B$BBut you want to know about Tethyr.  I said I'd make you a deal, so here's what I want you to do. I'm working on a new line of baits, but I haven't tested this one yet.$B$BJust take this paste -- yeah, it smells a little foul -- smear it on yourself, and swim into the deep part of Tidefury Cove to the southwest. Let me know how it works!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Smear Pagle's Fish Paste, Extra Strength on yourself, then swim into Tidefury Cove.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Remember, the deal is "don't come back until something bites you."</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Not bad at all, but you know, I think I'd get a bath in as soon as possible, if I was you.$B$BNow, about your sea monster...$B$BHelp yourself to a brew or two in the meantime.</RewardText>
