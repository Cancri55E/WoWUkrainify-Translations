  <Title>Is it Real?</Title>
  <Description>Oh, I'm sure you and Babs had a good laugh over the outlandish descriptions and sketches in the book, but have you stopped to consider there might be some truth to the legends?$B$BIf you listen closely enough, I bet you can still hear sailors talk about Tethyr, the sea creature the book says lives right here! Of course, if you wanted to know for sure, you could always ask old Nat Pagle.$B$BHe's got a small fishing camp on a little island in Tidefury Cove, which is southwest across Dustwallow Bay.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Talk to Nat Pagle at Nat's Landing in Dustwallow Marsh.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So you want to know about sea monsters? Hmm... well, I'll make you a deal, but it's going to involve a lot of alcohol and some embarrassment on your part.</RewardText>
