She's helped us from time to time and helped keep the peace here between the Horde and our forces.$B$BShe used to keep in regular contact, but we haven't received one lately.$B$BCould you check in with her when you have time? Just follow the road beyond North Point Tower, where it turns south and into the Quagmire. You can see her farm from the road.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Tabetha at her farm in the Quagmire.</LogDescription>
