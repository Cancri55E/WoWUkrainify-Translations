  <Title>Raze Direhorn Post!</Title>
  <Description>There's no scrying necessary to see the trouble my new "neighbors" are creating. And if this is the band that burnt down the Shady Rest Inn, as you claim, there's no reason to tolerate their presence any longer.$B$BTake this torch and raze their camp to the ground! You'll find Direhorn just to the north of my farm, near the road. You can't miss it, really, as the Grimtotems have done a splendid job of announcing their presence with those totems they favor.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Tabetha's Torch to burn the North Tent, East Tent, and the Northeast Tent at Direhorn Post.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you put that torch to good use?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The Grimtotems should have no trouble understanding our latest message.$B$BAs for you, your contact at Brackenwall Village will want to know of your success. If I know him, he'll appreciate the taste of vengeance.</RewardText>
