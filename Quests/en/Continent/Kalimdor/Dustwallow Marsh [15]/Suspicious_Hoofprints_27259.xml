  <LogDescription>Report about the suspicious prints at the Shady Rest Inn to Krog in Brackenwall Village.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Hoofprints... It could have been the quilboar, I suppose. Or maybe even the centaur. Their presence in the Barrens is not insignificant, and I would not think it a stretch to commit such an act.$b$bDid I tell you? It wasn't just that the inn was burned down... The owner's woman and pup were killed. Bad business, that.$b$bNonetheless, I will send Kagoro to find where the tracks lead.</RewardText>
