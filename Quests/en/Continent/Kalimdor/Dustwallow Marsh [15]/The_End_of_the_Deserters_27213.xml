  <Title>The End of the Deserters</Title>
  <Description>Now that we've eliminated the deserters from Theramore, it's time to complete this operation. My local contacts have reported that the deserters base their operations in a ship moored on a small island to the southeast of the docks.$B$BArresting their leader, Gavis Greyshield, should cause the others to lose their will to fight. Find him within the ship and convince him to surrender. I wouldn't be surprised if he puts up a bit of a fight for show, but then surrenders when he understands he can't win.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Defeat Gavis Greyshield aboard the ship southeast of Theramore.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Gavis' request isn't as outlandish as it might sound. With the proper handling, Lady Jaina can return the deserters to the fold, but that is her decision, of course.$B$BIt's been a pleasure working with you, $n. Without your help, I doubt the operation would've gone so smoothly. When I make my report in Stormwind, it will name you as the $c who ended the deserter threat.</RewardText>
