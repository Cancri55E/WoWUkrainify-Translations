  <Title>Identifying the Brood</Title>
  <Description>Whilst that craven fool, Mok'Morokk, wallows in power and Tharg wrestles the demons of sorrow and vengeance and vies for leadership of the clan, I seem to be the only one concerned with identifying the source of aggression on our old home.$b$bWhy the puzzled stare, $n? Expecting me to speak like an uncouth ruffian merely because I am an ogre?$b$bNow back to business, bring to me the hearts and tongues from the whelps and hatchlings. I shall trace the root of this evil...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Draz'Zilb in Brackenwall Village would like you to bring him 7 Searing Tongues and 7 Searing Hearts.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>With the hearts and tongues of scorched offspring of the black dragon army, I can decipher what wretched beast introduced her spawn into our home. Perhaps with a greater knowledge of our aggressors, we can seek to destroy them once and for all and reclaim Stonemaul Village from ruin.$b$bOf course, convincing Mok'Morokk to move his lethargic, fat mass out of this muck hole is going to be an epic quest in and of itself...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>'Twas a perilous affair, no doubt, collecting all of these hearts and tongues. I shall delve into the depths of the arcane to trace the origin of the black menace which has descended upon our former home.</RewardText>
