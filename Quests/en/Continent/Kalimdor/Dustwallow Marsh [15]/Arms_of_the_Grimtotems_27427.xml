  <Description>If the equipment you found at the ruins of the inn belonged to a Grimtotem attack party, there's likely to be more just like it within their camp to the northwest.$B$BWe haven't been able to gather much information about Blackhoof Village, but judging from the size of the raiding parties, there's a substantial force based there.$B$BDo whatever you have to to capture some of their equipment so that we can compare it with your findings from the inn.</Description>

  <CompletionText>Did you get those weapons from Blackhoof Village?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Captain Darill inspects the armaments you've brought from Blackhoof Village.&gt;$B$BThere's no doubt about it.
