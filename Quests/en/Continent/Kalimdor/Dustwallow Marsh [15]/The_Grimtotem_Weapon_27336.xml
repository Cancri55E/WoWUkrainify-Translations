  <Title>The Grimtotem Weapon</Title>
  <Description>During the last Grimtotem attack, I was wounded, but not before I managed to capture a curious totem our enemies were using against us.$B$BIt seemed to be emitting raw bolts of energy during the battle, but in all my experiments, I haven't managed to figure out how it works. I'll loan the totem to you if you agree to help me test it.$B$BThe watery areas surrounding the farm are home to pesky mottled drywallow crocolisks and drywallow daggermaws. Try fighting the crocolisks near the totem.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Captured Totem to set it on the ground, and kill 10 Mottled Drywallow Crocolisks or Drywallow Daggermaws near it to test its effects.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you had any luck testing the totem?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The apprentice listens as you describe your experiment.&gt;$B$BA haze and some lightning? That's it? There's got to be more to the totem than just that! The Grimtotems aren't likely to bring something like this to the battlefield unless it has some kind of utility.</RewardText>
