  <Title>Confirming the Suspicion</Title>
  <Description>The Grimtotems may be the most warlike of all the tauren clans, but they're by no means unorganized. If they're the ones who put the torch to the Shady Rest Inn, they'll have had orders from one of their clan elders.$B$BThere's a large Grimtotem settlement called Blackhoof Village to the northwest. They've been using it as a base to attack the tower, but I'll bet that you'll find the orders you're looking for there. Check the village's elders for traces of the orders you seek.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 4 Grimtotem Notes from Grimtotem Elders and combine them into the Grimtotem Battle Plan.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to find any trace of the orders?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Captain Darill glances at the battle plan.&gt;$B$BI'd say it doesn't get any clearer than this. They've taken it upon themselves to fight back against human settlements in the area and I have little doubt Theramore is next on their list.</RewardText>
