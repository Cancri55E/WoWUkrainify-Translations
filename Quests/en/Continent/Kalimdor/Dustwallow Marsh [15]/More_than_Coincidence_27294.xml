  <Title>More than Coincidence</Title>
  <Description>We've gleaned as much as we can from the ruins of the inn. I'm concerned about where the investigation will lead us from here, but we must know the truth.$B$BBetween the hoofprints and the shield with Mosarn's mark, I'm led to believe that the Grimtotems may have been involved. They've recently established a settlement in the swamp, Blackhoof Village to the northeast. Travel to Blackhoof Village and search for more arms of Mosarn's manufacture.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 7 Blackhoof Armaments from Blackhoof Village.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What did your search of Blackhoof Village reveal?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Krog inspects the weapons and armor you've brought from Blackhoof Village.&gt;$B$BThis is unmistakably the work of Mosarn. Questioning him further may draw too much attention, but we have a bit more freedom in dealing with the Grimtotems.</RewardText>
