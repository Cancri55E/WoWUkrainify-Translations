  <Title>Seek Out Tabetha</Title>
  <Description>The arms you captured in Blackhoof Village have not seen any combat beyond mere training exercises, which means the Grimtotems who destroyed the Shady Rest are still at large.$B$BTo the south, in the heart of the Quagmire, lives the witch Tabetha. Though she is a human, she has dealt honorably with us and trained some of our mages.$B$BAsk her for assistance in tracking down the band of Grimtotem responsible for burning the inn. The Alliance must not be allowed to think we were complicit in the attack.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Tabetha at her farm in the Quagmire.</LogDescription>
