  <Title>This Old Lighthouse</Title>
  <Description>The old lighthouse out to the east hasn't worked for some time, but Babs Fizzletorque has gotten it into her head to get it working again.$B$BI don't know how she plans to do it by herself, but she claims that it'll make the movement of ships and goods into the docks smoother, so I can't really object. Drawing duty on the docks is really nothing to complain about when you could be on the front lines, you know?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Babs Fizzletorque at the lighthouse on the island east of Theramore.</LogDescription>
