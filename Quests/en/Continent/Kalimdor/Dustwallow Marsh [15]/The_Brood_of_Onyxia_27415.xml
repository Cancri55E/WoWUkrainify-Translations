  <Title>The Brood of Onyxia</Title>
  <Description>Onyxia's brood has been scattered across the Dragonmurk. It is imperative that no more whelps be permitted to hatch.$b$bMake haste to Wyrmbog in the south of Dustwallow Marsh. Surely, she has made her lair there. Track down the evil dragon's eggs and destroy them.$b$bWe will never reclaim Stonemaul Village if the surrounding area remains a breeding ground.$b$bAs for Mok'Morokk... I have other plans for the sod.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy 5 Eggs of Onyxia.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You must hurry to the Dragonmurk, $n. With Onyxia's eggs riddled around the Wyrmbog, we face overwhelming numbers unless something is done quickly.$b$bDestroy her eggs! Don't let the black dragon plague spread across our homeland!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Splendid! It will be sometime before Onyxia can produce more eggs.$b$bOn behalf of my people, I thank you, $n.$b$bI have asked much of you so far. Perhaps you can do the Stonemaul Clan one last service.$b$bMok'Morokk is not fit to lead us. Tharg would make an excellent leader but is hindered by his injuries and age. Drive Mok'Morokk from this place by force. Only then can we appoint a new leader to return us to our proper home in the south.</RewardText>
