  <Description>Another component of my new recipe is the shelled leg of a giant crab.  And the crabs they have in Dustwallow -- spiny rock crawlers they call them -- will be perfect!$B$BThe shell of the crab leg is a key element of the dish's presentation so I need pristine, unscarred legs.  An adult crab might only have one or two such legs, and I need a lot in order to research my dish.$B$BHead on over to the rocks surrounding Theramore and get me those legs!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 12 Pristine Crawler Legs to Morgan Stern in Theramore.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>My research with the Mudrock tongues is progressing nicely.  I trust your crab hunt goes well?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These are wonderful specimens, $n!  The shells are in perfect condition, and the meat is pink and tender.  The blood of a chef is in your veins, I'm sure of it!</RewardText>
