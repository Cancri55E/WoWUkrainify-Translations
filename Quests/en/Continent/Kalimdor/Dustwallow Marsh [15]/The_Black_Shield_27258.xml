  <Title>The Black Shield</Title>
  <Description>Ah, I remember now! Mosarn is a well-respected blacksmith in Thunder Bluff. I knew I had heard his name somewhere, before.$b$bIn thanks, the Earthen Ring awarded me with a set of armor crafted by Mosarn. Very good work.$b$bPerhaps he can tell you more about the shield he crafted.$b$bIt's not much of a lead, but since we didn't get anything useful out of Reethe, it's all we have.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Show the Blackened Iron Shield to Mosarn in Thunder Bluff.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hello there, $c. Something I can help you with?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Yes, you are certainly correct. This is a shield that I made.$b$bI'm afraid there's not much more I can tell you though, $n. I craft so many different shields and sets of armor, I can't keep track of them all.</RewardText>
