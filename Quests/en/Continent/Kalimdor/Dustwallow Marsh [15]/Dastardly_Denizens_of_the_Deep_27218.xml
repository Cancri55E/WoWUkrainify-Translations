  <Title>Dastardly Denizens of the Deep</Title>
  <Description>You know, it's amazing what you can find in that old lighthouse. After I lit the lamp, I noticed this book in one of the old trunks up there.$B$B&lt;Babs holds up the book and reads the title dramatically.&gt;$B$B"Dastardly Denizens of the Deep!"$B$BWhy, I think I might swoon if I ever saw one of these! I'm sure it's good for a laugh or two, but I simply don't have time for reading right now.$B$BYou know who might enjoy it, though... that fishmonger on the docks, "Dirty" Michael Crowe. He collects old books.</Description>

  <CompletionText>What'll it be today? The snook is quite good.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, now, that was thoughtful o' Babs to send that over. I don't know if you've leafed through it or not, but there's a lot of truth to the tales in that book. Sailors didn't just make it all up, you know.</RewardText>
