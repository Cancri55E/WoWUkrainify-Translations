  <Title>Mudrock Soup and Bugs</Title>
  <Description>I'm working on a dish I call "Mudrock Soup and Bugs."  I still need the major ingredients, and... well, I don't think I'd last long trudging through Dustwallow Marsh!$B$BSo, $n, can you do some hunting for me?  First, I need the tongues of Mudrock turtles.  You can find Mudrocks along the coast, mostly around the bay.$B$BBut I don't want just any tongues!  I hear that the tongues of some Mudrocks are forked...$B$BThey say the forked tongues have a distinct flavor, and I want that flavor in my dish...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 8 Forked Mudrock Tongues to Morgan Stern in Theramore.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get the forked tongues?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These will do fine!  Thank you, $n!$B$BNow I'll try different cooking techniques on these tongues to find the best way to bring out their flavor.$B$BEventually I'll have a dish worthy of serving at the Blue Recluse in Stormwind!</RewardText>
