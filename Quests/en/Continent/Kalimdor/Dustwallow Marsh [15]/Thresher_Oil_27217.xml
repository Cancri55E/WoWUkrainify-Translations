  <Title>Thresher Oil</Title>
  <Description>The old log in the lighthouse indicates that the lamp was fueled with oil from the threshers that live along the coast here.$B$B&lt;Babs wrinkles her nose at the mention of such outdated technology.&gt;$B$BI suppose it's a practical, if inelegant solution. The log says that the oil taken from the youngest murk threshers works the best, and those live right underneath the docks of Theramore.$B$BIf you're up for it, would you help resupply the lighthouse with fuel?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 4 containers of Thresher Oil from Murk Threshers beneath the Theramore docks.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to get any of that thresher oil?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, I have my doubts, but this is the only solution available right now. Once we have it up and running, I'm sure there will be time to look at other ways to fuel the lamp.</RewardText>
