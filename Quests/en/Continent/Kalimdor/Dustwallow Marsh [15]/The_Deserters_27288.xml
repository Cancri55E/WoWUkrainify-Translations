We're not so many in number that we could stand up to those mindless brutes.$b$bHe crossed the line one too many times, so we left him to fend for himself.$b$bNow, I helped you out... So, why don't you help us out and forget you bumped into us?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore about Reethe.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I will send Lieutenant Caldwell to deal with the deserters at Lost Point. In addition, I will instruct him to find Reethe. The marsh is not so big and trackless that he should be unable to find him.</RewardText>
