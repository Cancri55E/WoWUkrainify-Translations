  <Title>The Black Shield</Title>
  <Description>Ah, I almost missed this... The leather strap on the back must have burned off, but it seems like it was made to fit a large person. I'd guess a tauren, actually.$b$bThat's about all I can tell you. Tell Captain Vimes I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Captain Garran Vimes in Theramore.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That's not much information to work on, but we'll have to keep it in mind. Hopefully some of the other pieces of this mystery will fall into place, and paint a more helpful picture of what happened.</RewardText>
