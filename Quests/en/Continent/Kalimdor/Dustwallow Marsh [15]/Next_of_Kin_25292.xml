His family will want to know what became of their youngest warrior.$B$BSeek out Alto Stonespire. He is posted in Dustwallow Marsh. Go northeast, and follow the roads to Brackenwall Village.</Description>

  <CompletionText>Hello, $c. You look to be caked in dust instead of mud. I take it you've ventured here from the Barrens?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Alto clenches the bullet in his palm as you tell your story.&gt;$B$BGann? Dead? I ... I should've known. His temper... his recklessness. I knew someday it would get the better of him.$B$BBut it sounds as though you've already gifted him with vengeance. Thank you, $n!$B$BTurn your attention now to Dustwallow. If the Alliance finishes their cursed road through here, all your victories in the Barrens may have been for nothing. </RewardText>
