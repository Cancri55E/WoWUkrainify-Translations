  <Title>Delivery for Drazzit</Title>
  <Description>Drazzit will expect to hear something from me soon, but I don't think the site is secure enough for me to leave. If you have time, would you be willing to take some of the salvaged cargo down to him at Mudsprocket?$B$BIf you haven't been there yet, it's a small settlement to the southwest of here, beyond the Stonemaul Ruins. You can take the road there from Tabetha's Farm, too. When you get to Mudsprocket, the guy you're looking for is Drazzit Dripvalve.</Description>

  <RewardText>&lt;Drazzit accepts the cargo from you.&gt;$B$BI'm so hungry, I could eat a dragon! Thank goodness Moxie finally got some of that cargo down here. We've been reduced to playing dice against the ogre for whatever he's managed to kill on his hunting trips!</RewardText>
