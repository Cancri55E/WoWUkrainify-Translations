  <Title>Help for Mudsprocket</Title>
  <Description>When that goblin... what's her name... Boxie, Foxy... Moxie, that's it! Anyway, when she came through here on her way to the zeppelin wreck, she said the town of Mudsprocket was having some problems.$B$BThat crashed zeppelin was bringing them fresh supplies. If you follow the road south from here, past the Stonemaul Ruins, you'll eventually come to Mudsprocket.$B$BWhy don't you check in with Drazzit Dripvalve down there and see if there's anything you can do to help?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Drazzit Dripvalve at Mudsprocket.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It's good of Tabetha to send you down here. I'd prevail upon her for some food until the wreckage from the zeppelin is taken care of, but I know she's got none to spare at the moment. If you're feeling adventurous, I've posted a bounty for the death of a particularly nasty raptor.</RewardText>
