  <Title>Traitors Among Us</Title>
  <Description>It's good to meet you, $c. I've come to Theramore to help eliminate the problem of the deserters. Not only have some of the men abandoned their posts, but some have filtered back into the town.$B$BThese deserter agents are spreading lies and propaganda, hoping to convince others to join their ranks.$B$BThey're at virtually every guard post throughout the town and the docks. Find them, expose them, and discredit them. At this point, anything more risks inspiring more sympathy for them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Confront 5 Deserter Agitators in Theramore.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you driven the deserter agents from Theramore?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n. I think we managed to catch them off guard. Their agents probably thought themselves safe within the city walls.$B$BGiven time, the agitators will return and spread their lies again. We'll use the time you've bought to shut out the deserters further.</RewardText>
