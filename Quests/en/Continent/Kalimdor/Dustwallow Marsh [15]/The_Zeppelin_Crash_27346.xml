  <Title>The Zeppelin Crash</Title>
  <Description>Not long ago, a goblin zeppelin crashed to the east. A representative of the Steamwheedle Cartel passed through here a few days ago.$B$BShe was looking for information about the zeppelin's cargo and its pilot, Beezil, but none of us really got a good look at the crash. I doubt she'll be able to clean up after the wreck by herself, much less recover whatever cargo the vessel might have carried.$B$BIf you have time, you may want to check up on her out at Beezil's Wreck, due east of here, near the mountains.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Moxie Steelgrille at Beezil's Wreck.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So those hermit mages sent you? How can I be sure that I can trust you?$B$BI suppose I can use the help. There's not much here a mage would be interested in, anyway.</RewardText>
