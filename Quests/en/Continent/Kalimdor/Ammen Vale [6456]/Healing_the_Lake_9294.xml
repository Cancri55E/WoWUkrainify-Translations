  <Title>Healing the Lake</Title>
  <Description>Thank goodness, I think it'll work!  I have an agent for you to spread at Silverline Lake to the south.  It will neutralize the effects of the irradiated ship's power crystal that fell there.$B$BSwim out and scatter the neutralizing agent near it.  Don't worry, you won't be exposed long enough to become irradiated.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Disperse the Neutralizing Agent at the Irradiated Power Crystal, then return to Botanist Taerix at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The sooner you disperse the agent at the lake, the fewer native creatures that will be mutated by drinking the water, including ourselves!$B$BI'm sorry that we can't do anything to help the poor creatures that have already been infected. If only my lab equipment were intact.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>From what you describe, the neutralizing agent worked! I just wish that I knew how long it will last; we really need to remove that power crystal from the lake entirely.$B$BThank you, $n! I will tell Tedon to try the neutralizing agent on one of the captured beasts at once.</RewardText>
