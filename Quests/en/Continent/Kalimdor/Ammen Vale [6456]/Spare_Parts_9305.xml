  <Title>Spare Parts</Title>
  <Description>We managed to recover a damaged holographic emitter from the crash. If we repair it, we'll have a chance to find other survivors outside of Ammen Vale.$B$BThere were devices from the ship that could be salvaged for spare parts in the area, but the local owlkin carried them off before we could get to them. $B$B$n, you must go south to Nestlewood Thicket and Hills to find the spare parts.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 4 Emitter Spare Parts and then return to Technician Zhanaa at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>When we have those spare parts, I know that we'll get this emitter repaired. With any luck there will be someone else out there left to talk to.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Let me take a look at those.$B$BYes, I think that these will do nicely; good job, $N. The emitter is rather complex so it may take some time to finish the repairs. I'll let you know when it's ready.$b$bIn the meantime, you might see if Vindicator Aldar has anything he could use you for.</RewardText>
