  <Title>Replenishing the Healing Crystals</Title>
  <Description>We are the draenei.  Our ship crashed and, since we have many wounded, our immediate concern is the depleted state of our healing crystals.  We must replenish them quickly!$B$BUnfortunately, the only way to do this at this point is to extract the blood from the local vale moths.  Their blood will make for a suitable substitute.$B$BThe moths can be found in many places around the vale, but mostly in the northwest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Acquire 6 Vials of Moth Blood from the nearby Vale Moths and bring them to Proenitus at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you harvested the necessary moth blood for the healing crystals yet?  With survivors scattered all over the vale, time is of the essence!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Regrettable that those creatures had to die so that we might live - indiscriminate killing is not the draenei way.  However, the blood you gathered will replenish our healing crystals, so their deaths will not be in vain.</RewardText>
