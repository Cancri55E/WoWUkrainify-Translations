  <Title>Inoculation</Title>
  <Description>Zhanaa needs our help to salvage parts from the Exodar.  Taerix prepared an inoculum that can be given to the Nestlewood owlkin that live in the area of a lot of the salvage.$B$BJust get close to the unaffected ones and use the crystal on them.  Unfortunately, you'll have to kill the others.  You'll find the owlkin at Nestlewood Thicket and Nestlewood Hills to the southeast.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Inoculating Crystal on 6 Nestlewood Owlkin. Then return to Vindicator Aldar at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The more we can do to clear up Nestlewood, the faster Zhanaa can get back to work.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>With many of the owlkin now inoculated, we can focus on getting out of here and not have to worry about wiping out the owlkin population in the area.$B$BHere, choose from these.  You've done good work, and you deserve to be rewarded!</RewardText>
