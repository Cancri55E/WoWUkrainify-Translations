  <Title>Volatile Mutations</Title>
  <Description>The irradiated power cores from the Exodar have been wreaking havoc on the environment here. The most obvious effect has been the appearance of the strange creatures that seem to have sprung up near them.$b$bThere may be something we can do to help them, but now, their sheer numbers are becoming too much for us to handle.$b$bI'd like you to go out and cull their numbers somewhat, and perhaps I'll have another idea after giving it some thought.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 Volatile Mutations, then return to Botanist Taerix at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I am working on a solution I think may be effective with the strange creatures. I just need more time.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You're finished? That's good news. Hopefully, we can find a way to avoid the killing of these mutated beasts in the future.$b$bI believe I have formed a plan that might give us an alternative solution to this problem, but I will need your help.</RewardText>
