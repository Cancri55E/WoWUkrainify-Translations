  <Title>Blood Elf Spy</Title>
  <Description>I have a plan. We must kill their leader. Without their master, perhaps they will retreat to regroup. We just need to buy time until the repairs are completed.$b$bThen Vindicator Aldar must know of this. Kill the surveyor, then return and tell him what we've found.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Surveyor Candress and then inform Vindicator Aldar at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Then it is true... a scouting party of blood elves here in Ammen Vale! How did they follow us?$B$BI'll get someone out there immediately to bring Tolaan back.</CompletionText>
