  <Title>What Must Be Done...</Title>
  <Description>The nearby lake has been contaminated by one of the ship's power crystals.  Many of the plants and animals of Ammen Vale have been mutated because of this.$B$BI have a theory on how to heal the lake, but I must have samples from the mutated lashers for analysis.  They can be found to the west in the Ammen Fields.$B$BWill you help me, $c?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 10 Lasher Samples and return them to Botanist Taerix at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I'll need all of the samples in good condition if we're to have a chance of cleansing the lake.$B$BWe don't have much time, $c!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These will do. Thank you, $c!$B$BWhile you were out, I managed to gather some equipment together to make an analysis of the samples.  This should only take a moment.</RewardText>
