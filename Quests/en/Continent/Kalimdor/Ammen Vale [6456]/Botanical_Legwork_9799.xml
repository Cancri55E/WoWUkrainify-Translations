  <Title>Botanical Legwork</Title>
  <Description>The Ammen Fields to the west are the primary breeding ground of the local lasher population. With the corruption of the water table from the nearby lake, Botanist Taerix is worried that the lashers will not be able to repopulate themselves once we've cleansed the lake.$B$BGo to the Ammen Fields and pick some of the corrupted flowers for me so that I might take a look at them and see what can be done. You should be able to identify them by their uncharacteristic red petals.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 3 Corrupted Flowers and return them to Apprentice Vishael at the Crash Site in Ammen Vale.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hello, $c.  Do you have those flowers yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These look like fine specimens.  Thank you for performing the field work.  Once I can find the time to analyze these, I should be able to tell what it will take to restore the fields.</RewardText>
