  <Title>Gnarlpine Corruption</Title>
  <Description>The Gnarlpine tribe's corruption has returned!$b$bThey ambushed me as I left for the Ban'ethil Barrow Den and proceeded to pillage Starbreeze Village. Something in the forest has corrupted Ursal the Mauler, their chieftain, and he is using the evil powers of the fel moss to drive them mad.$b$bI am too wounded to return to Athridas to bring him this grave news.  The task is left to you, young $c.  We can only hope that the deranged Gnarlpines have not made it to Ban'ethil yet!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Athridas Bearmantle in Dolanaar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>By the stars!  This is quite disturbing indeed!$B$BWe've had troubles in the past with the corruption of the furbolgs, but such troubles should be long past since the cleansing of Teldrassil. I fear for all our people if the blessings of the aspects themselves cannot redeem our great tree.</RewardText>
