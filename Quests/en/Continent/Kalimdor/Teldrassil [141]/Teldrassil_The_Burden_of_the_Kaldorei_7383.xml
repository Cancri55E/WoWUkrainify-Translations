  <Title>Teldrassil: The Burden of the Kaldorei</Title>

I will meet you at the crossroads in front of Darnassus when your task is complete.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Fill the Amethyst Phial.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>To be in the presence of the Oracle Tree... it is almost to feel wisdom take form.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Along with the druids, the Oracle Tree has been carefully monitoring the growth of Teldrassil. Our observations have been disheartening, but all is not without hope.$B$BThe tree is indeed recovering since its blessing, but the growth is still somehow stunted... hindered.$B$BWe suspect some portion of the corruption remains within the tree, waiting to be cleansed. We simply need to find it.</RewardText>
