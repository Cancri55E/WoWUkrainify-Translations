  <Title>Dolanaar Delivery</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, young $c.  Can you offer me aid?  I have a package of herbs that I must deliver to the town of Dolanaar.  But I still have business with the druids of Shadowglen and cannot yet leave.$B$BCan you deliver this package for me?  It must be sent to Innkeeper Keldamyr, at the Dolanaar inn.  It lies along the road, to the south.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Dolanaar Delivery to Innkeeper Keldamyr.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How might I be of service to you, young one?  Are you here to rest in the inn?  Do you require a hearthstone?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah yes, the delivery of herbs from Shadowglen.  It is a shame Porthannius could not bring it himself, for we have much to discuss, he and I.  But I am glad to get the herbs nonetheless, and I am glad you came.$B$BWhile you are here, please, rest yourself.  Heroes must keep their strength and spirits high, and must find rest and solace whenever they may.  For to neglect one's peace of body and mind is a sure path to failure.$B$BSo... rest.</RewardText>
