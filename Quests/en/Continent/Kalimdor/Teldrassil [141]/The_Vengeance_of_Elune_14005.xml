  <Title>The Vengeance of Elune</Title>
  <Description>As Teldrassil purges itself of the corruption that has perverted its growth for all of these years, a malevolent growth has formed near the tree's edge, south of here. We have an opportunity to strike out and purge the source of the fel moss that has tainted the gnarlpine, the timberlings, and everything else.$B$BWith the water that you've collected from the moonwells and the renewed strength of Teldrassil herself, I can grant you great power for a short while. Put an end to this corruption, $n.</Description>

  <RewardText>Elune be praised!$B$BEverything I had encountered suggested this corruption to be buried deep within Teldrassil itself... I had worried we might never be able to strike at the source without killing the world tree. I am thankful I was wrong!$B$BMalfurion was the start to this great turn of fortune. Perhaps I will seek him out before I depart to the wilds again.$B$BThank you, $n. Thank you for everything you have done. You are sure to be a great hero someday!</RewardText>
