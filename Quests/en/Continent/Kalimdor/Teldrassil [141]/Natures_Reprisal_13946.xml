  <Title>Nature's Reprisal</Title>
  <Description>I'm glad you were willing to atone for your mistake - it speaks a great deal about your character.$B$BI have another task for you. I have gathered some ireroot seeds. They are somewhat like fel cones, but quite a bit more potent. Nature often responds very negatively to demons, and these ireroot seeds prompt a very concentrated form of that reprisal.$B$BTo our north, in Fel Rock, there are grellkin that are far beyond redemption. Use the ireroot seeds to route them before they become a more serious threat.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use ireroot seeds to kill 12 grellkin in Fel Rock.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you have any success in routing those grellkin for us?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good. I know this probably wasn't very pleasant work, but we greatly appreciate it.$B$BI fear for our dear Teldrassil... it seems it is becoming more corrupt by the day, and our ignorance to the cause is plaguing me greatly.</RewardText>
