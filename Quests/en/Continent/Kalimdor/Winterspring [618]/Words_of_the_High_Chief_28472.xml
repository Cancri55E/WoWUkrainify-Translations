  <Description>The Winterfall are no longer a threat to me, but if you still want to find out what was driving the furbolg to create and consume this strange firewater, I think you should seek out Kelek Skykeeper.$B$BHe's a druid that once worked to help cleanse Felwood with the Emerald Circle, and has since come here to study the nearby ruins.$B$BYou might be able to find him to the east at Lake Kel'theril, where he spends his time recently.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take the Crudely-written Log to Kelek Skykeeper at Lake Kel'theril.</LogDescription>
