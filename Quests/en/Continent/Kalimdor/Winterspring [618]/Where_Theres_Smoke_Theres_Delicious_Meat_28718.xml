  <Title>Where There's Smoke, There's Delicious Meat</Title>
  <Description>Say there, $c... do you like meat?  Even better, do you like money?$b$bI got a second cousin who's making a killing in the frozen meats business.  He's set up a smoking pit up north, and he's looking for help hunting all the dangerous beasties that always tend to taste so good.$b$bCarnivores pay well, friend.  I'm too heavily invested here in this barrow den - what was I thinking? - so I might as well pass the tip on to a helpful $r like yourself.$b$bHis name's Jez.  Head northeast, and look for the smoke!</Description>
