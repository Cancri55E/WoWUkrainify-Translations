  <Title>A Little Gamy</Title>
  <Description>Many find the meat of the Shardtooth bears to be too gamy for their taste. I disagree, though I'm not one to judge the tastes of others.$b$bThe Shardtooth Maulers, however - their brown-furred cousins, to the south - have much more tender flesh, particularly in their paws. And I've heard that the snout is also considered a delicacy.$b$bContinue your hunt, $n. Let's see if you can bag those maulers for ol' Francis.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Kill 15 Shardtooth Maulers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Francis smacks his lips.&gt;$b$bYou've got to try some of this, $n.  These maulers are perfectly tenderized... possibly because of the pummeling you delivered.</RewardText>
