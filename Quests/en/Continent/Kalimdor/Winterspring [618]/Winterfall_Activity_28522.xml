  <Title>Winterfall Activity</Title>
  <Description>The Timbermaw tend to stay to themselves, $n.  While we do allow safe passage to those we trust, we try to avoid other furbolg tribes if at all possible.$B$BThe Winterfall tribe has become increasingly hostile towards us.  They seem to be in a state of rage, completely engulfed by their own fear and hatred of anything they do not understand.$B$BThe Winterfall carry spirit beads, which have clearly failed to protect them against corruption. Bring me 10 of these beads to show you have thinned their ranks.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Spirit Beads from Winterfall furbolg.
</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We very much appreciate what you have done for the Timbermaw, $n.  Your continued efforts will surely earn my tribe's trust and respect.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for what you have done, as saddening as it is.  Accept this as a token of thanks.$B$BI would ask of you to please continue helping us, $n.  We have very few allies on which to call upon, and without your aid, the threats against my tribe would surely be too much for us to handle alone.</RewardText>
