  <Title>Fresh Frostsabers</Title>
  <Description>Doesn't that smell great? My smoked meats get top dollar, and nobody else provides the exotic flavors I've got out here in the hills. And it's efficient; you just do the hunting for a small fee, and my other fine friends drag the beasts back here for skinnin' and smokin'!$B$BI've got the market cornered on Frostsaber meat right now. Absolutely delicious stuff, makes great sausages. Head out and hunt those cats just west of here, and we'll call that a start!</Description>
