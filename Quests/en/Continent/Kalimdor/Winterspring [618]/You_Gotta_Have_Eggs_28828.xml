  <Title>You Gotta Have Eggs</Title>
  <Description>I don't have a very discerning palate, but even I can't stand the taste of those chimaeras that you'll find around here.  Their eggs, however, are a different story.$b$bChimaera eggs are the richest, most buttery eggs you'll find this side of Orgrimmar.  Way better than boring owl eggs, and not as sulfurous as those weird wildkin eggs.$b$bI'll take as many of them as you can gather.  Head northeast, and look for their nests in the snow.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 40 Chillwind Eggs.</LogDescription>
