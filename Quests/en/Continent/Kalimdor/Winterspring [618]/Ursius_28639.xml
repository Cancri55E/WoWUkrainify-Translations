  <Title>Ursius</Title>
  <Description>I've heard it said that you are what you eat. I don't know if I believe that, but if it's true... I'd prefer to eat the strongest creature that I can find.$b$bUrsius is the largest bear in Winterspring. He eats first when his pack of shardtooth brings down a chimaera or an owlbear. He claims the most comfortable cave in the shardtooth-held lands. And he has... considerable influence with the shardtooth females.$b$bHe is my kind of bear.$b$bI want to eat him.$b$bHis cave is near the maulers. Good luck!</Description>
