  <Title>Rubble Trouble</Title>
  <Description>If you want to get a boulder in there, you can use my own patented Boulder-in-a-Box! Normally I'd just sell you one up front, but I'm fresh out of materials.$B$BEarth elementals have been popping up on the peak directly south of town. They're a good source of rubble. If you bring me back a good amount, I'll pay you for the restock, and I'll throw in a Boulder-in-a-Box absolutely free!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 6 Prime Rubble Chunks from Frostshard Rumblers.</LogDescription>
