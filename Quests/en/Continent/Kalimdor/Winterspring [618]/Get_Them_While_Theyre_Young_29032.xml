  <Title>Get Them While They're Young</Title>
  <Description>I can teach you to ride a Winterspring frostsaber, but it takes time and dedication. For this to work, both saber and rider must be highly trained and both must share a bond of deep trust.$B$BThe cubs are only receptive to this training if they're introduced to their riders at a young age. Some of the cubs in the dens surrounding Frostsaber Rock are at the proper age to begin their training. If you help me gather the most promising of those cubs, I'll allow you to begin training with your own cub.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 8 Frostsaber Cubs from the dens around Frostsaber Rock.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We must get the saber cubs while they're still young enough to bond with people. If they get too old, the cats will remain feral forever.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These cubs are just the right age to begin their training. A few of them even have the proper traits to be trained as mounts. As promised, I'll select one of these cubs for you to train. This fellow here seems to have an affinity for you.$B$BI'll train the more common, docile cubs for the market in Darnassus.</RewardText>
