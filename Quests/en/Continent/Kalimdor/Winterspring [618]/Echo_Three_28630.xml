  <Title>Echo Three</Title>
  <Description>A lot of goblins have been going missing out there in Ice Thistle Hills. I was almost one of them!$B$BI had the idea to set up a sensor to tell us when the yeti were getting close to Everlook. Of course, it's not working either. There's yeti all over the hills and I haven't heard a peep from it.$B$BWould you mind checking on it for me? It might still be fixable. Echo Three's set up to the southeast on the edge of Ice Thistle Hills. Don't ask what happened to Echo One and Two.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Echo Three.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Part of this machine is still moving, but on closer inspection it's been severely manhandled. The metal is dented and cracked, and there's huge footprints in the snow all around it.$B$BIn fact, it sounds like something's approaching right now...</RewardText>
