  <Title>The Owlbeasts' Defense</Title>
  <Description>What a shame. Whatever Umbranse has done, he has prevented me from undoing his magic.$b$bHe is wiser than I had anticipated.$b$bI do have a backup plan, however. I have seen owlbeasts enter and leave Mazthoril, even after Umbranse took control. Their ancient druidic magic must be capable of disabling Umbranse's. Luckily, I happen to be somewhat of an expert in their methods.$b$bTravel south, to Dun Mandarr. You will find a chest with a dreamcatcher in it.$b$bThat will be your first step.</Description>
