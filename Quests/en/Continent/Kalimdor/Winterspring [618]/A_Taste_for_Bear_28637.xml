  <Title>A Taste for Bear</Title>
  <Description>Have you ever had the luxury of trying bear meat? I never had the chance to try it in Gilneas, but the bears here are simply exquisite.$B$BThe shardtooth bears that roam just to the south are well-marbled with fat from the cold here. I've been hunting them myself, and it's quite a lark, but I much prefer eating them!$B$BI recommend you try your hand at the hunt. Stick to the white-pelted Shardtooth bears, and the Captain will go to field to bring back any you kill.</Description>

  <RewardText>Simply splendid! I've been watching the Captain bring bear after bear back to camp and I can't wait to see them thrown on the smoker.$B$BPerhaps I'll have a taste of them raw...</RewardText>
