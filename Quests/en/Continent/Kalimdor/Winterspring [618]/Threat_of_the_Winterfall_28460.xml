  <Title>Threat of the Winterfall</Title>
  <Description>I came to Winterspring to investigate the Frostfire Hot Springs. I've noticed that the water seems to have... strange qualities. I haven't yet been able to discover the source, and to tell you the truth, I've had some difficulty lately, due to the Winterfall furbolg.$B$BThey seem to be drawn to the springs, just as I am. They have become extremely protective of the water, and won't let me come near the two larger springs to the north of here.$B$BI'd like to continue my studies, so won't you help me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 15 Winterfall furbolg of any kind near the Frostfire Hot Springs.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I appreciate your help!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thanks so much, $n! Now I can get back to work here.$B$BDid you find anything of interest at the Winterfall camp?</RewardText>
