  <Title>Your Place In The World</Title>
  <Description>Finally, you are of age, $n... of age to battle in the name of the Horde. To conquer for the glory of the Warchief.

Yes...

&lt;Kaltunk looks you over.&gt;

You will do nicely.

No doubt you wish to find a great dragon or demon and strangle it with your bare hands, but perhaps it would be wise to start on something less... dangerous.

&lt;Kaltunk laughs.&gt;

Report to Gornek, he should be able to assign a task better suited to a young $c. You will find him seated at the fire behind me.</Description>

  <RewardText>Another one of Kaltunk's recruits, hmm?

A sorry state of affairs we find ourselves in if this is the best the Horde can produce. No matter. By the time we think you're ready to leave the Valley, you'll be a proud warrior of the Horde.</RewardText>
