  <Title>Back to the Den</Title>
  <Description>Seeing the deed you have done for me steels my heart. I cannot fall so easily! I must endure!

But it remains that I cannot make the trek back to our settlement unassisted. Please, $n, return and tell Gornek of my situation. Perhaps he can help me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the news of Hana'zua's plight to Gornek in the Valley of Trials.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>From your description of the beast, I believe you must be speaking of Sarkoth! It is no wonder that Hana'zua was overtaken by it. Aid will be dispatched to him immediately, trouble yourself no more with Hana'zua's plight.

However, I must say, I am most impressed to hear that you brought Sarkoth to death. It is a feat to be proud of, $n. And that you would fight for a stranger's honor, while other tasks occupied your time, your own honor is heightened.</RewardText>
