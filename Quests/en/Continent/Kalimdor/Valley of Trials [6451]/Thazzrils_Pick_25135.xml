  <Title>Thazz'ril's Pick</Title>
  <Description>$n, you are a dependable $r. Can I count on you for another task?

Some time ago I was surveying the cave to the north for minerals, and I left my favorite pick behind. When I later returned to retrieve it I found the cave was filled with vicious beasts! Will you go into the cave, the Burning Blade Coven, and get my pick?

I left it in a chamber with waterfalls. My pick has a spell on it so you can see it in the dark, so you won't have to worry about finding it... just what's guarding it!</Description>

  <RewardText>Great, you got it! Thanks a lot, $n. This is my favorite pick! Now if my peons ever finish chopping down these trees, maybe we can find a nice cave to mine!</RewardText>
