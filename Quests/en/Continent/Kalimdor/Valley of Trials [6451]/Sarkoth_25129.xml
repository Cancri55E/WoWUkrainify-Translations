  <Title>Sarkoth</Title>
  <Description>$C! I thought I would die out here with none to know of it. While I was hunting the scorpids of the Valley, I came across a particularly vicious-looking one. Hurling myself at it, I managed to inflict a massive blow to its claw before it closed around my leg.

I wasn't ready for its stinger though, and it sliced down and into my chest, cutting into my flesh and letting my blood. Please, you must kill the scorpid for me! My honor must be upheld! I fought it up on the plateau to the south.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Kill Sarkoth and bring his claw back to Hana'zua.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Ahhh... my father always said I would never amount to much, and here, lying beneath a tree as life seeps away, I'm afraid it looks like he was right.

At least I wish to die knowing that my last enemy in life lays dead.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>My blow was not enough to kill him, but looking at the damage I inflicted gives me some small measure of pride. That small measure will be all I have to sustain myself if I die, and in that light, the short list of my life's accomplishments fills me with anger.</RewardText>
