  <Title>Vile Familiars</Title>
  <Description>I trust the Valley of Trials will teach you much, young $c.

I was sent to the Valley to guide you, but I have discovered a growing taint here...

One of the Burning Blade - a foul, demon-worshipping cult - has made camp here in the Valley of Trials. He skulks in a cave to the north, and his vile familiars have spilled from its mouth to cause havoc.

As your first task against the Burning Blade, I bid you, defeat these familiars. Slay many and, if you survive, return to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 Vile Familiars.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>To prove yourself against the Burning Blade, you must first defeat these vile familiars. Return to me when you have done this.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You have done well, $n.

Although the Vile Familiars were merely pets of the darker powers within the Burning Blade, your success against them foretells greater deeds ahead.</RewardText>
