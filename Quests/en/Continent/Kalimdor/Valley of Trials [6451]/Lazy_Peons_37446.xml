  <Title>Lazy Peons</Title>
  <Description>Cursed peons! They work hard gathering lumber from the trees of the valley, but they're always taking naps! I need someone to help keep the peons in line.

You look like the right $r for my task. Here, you take this blackjack and use it on any lazy peons you find sleeping on the job. A good smack will get them right back to work! Return the blackjack when you're done.

Look for them underneath the trees in the valley. Lousy slacking peons...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Foreman's Blackjack on 4 Lazy Peons when they're sleeping.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>No good lazy...

Eh? Do you have my blackjack? Did you catch any peons sleeping on the job?!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good, good. Maybe they'll think twice before slacking next time! Thanks for the help!</RewardText>
