  <Title>Sting of the Scorpid</Title>
  <Description>I must send you back into the fields again, $c. You will find large numbers of scorpids northwest of here. Bring me eight of their tails.

The antidote for their sting is actually made from venom extracted from their stingers. We keep large quantities of antidote for scorpid venom on hand to heal young bloods just like you...

But I'm sure you won't be needing any of that, will you?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 8 Scorpid Worker Tails.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The carapace of a scorpid isn't so thick that the strength of a determined warrior will be deterred. Strike strongly and without doubt, and the scorpids should prove easy prey.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There is an important lesson that you must take away from fighting scorpids. The smallest or largest of opponents can still send you to your doom. In fierce combat, any number of things can prove your downfall.

I have no more to teach you, $n. You have done well, and I will watch your progress with interest.</RewardText>
