  <Title>Cutting Teeth</Title>
  <Description>The first order of business will be to put a little strength in your backbone. I could send you out to the Barrens to hunt kodo, but well, in all honesty, you're more useful to us alive than dead.

I believe you'll be of more use to us slaughtering the boars you'll find in the farms to the north and northeast of here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slaughter 6 Mottled Boars.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I hope you haven't returned to try and convince me that you have completed your task, $n? No, of course not. I would think better of you.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hmm, not bad, $n. But don't let it get to your head...you'll fight tougher than boars in your career.

Nonetheless, you've proven yourself well, and your next trial will be against a considerably more dangerous opponent, so you'll need some extra protection.</RewardText>
