  <Title>Burning Blade Medallion</Title>
  <Description>Through my divinations, I see that an item of power--a medallion--hides deep within the Burning Blade Coven, guarded by beasts and black magic. We must have it.

For too long these demon-worshippers have defiled our homelands. Cleanse the coven of its demonic taint by slaying the fel beasts and their leader. Return with this medallion as proof of your deed.

Go, $n. You will find the coven in a cave to the north.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 5 Felstalkers and obtain the Burning Blade Medallion.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is your task complete, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You retrieved it! Well done!

Your efforts within the Burning Blade Coven are key in rooting out this cult in the Valley of Trials. But I fear they have further aims in our land.

We have not seen the end of them.</RewardText>
