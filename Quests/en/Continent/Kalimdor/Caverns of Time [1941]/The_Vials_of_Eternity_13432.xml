  <Title>The Vials of Eternity</Title>
  <Description>Seven vials were drawn from the Well of Eternity by Illidan.  He poured three into the lake on top of Mount Hyjal and a second Well of Eternity was created.  For years the rest were believed lost.$B$BWith the opening of the Dark Portal, we've come to know that he gave one each to his lieutenants Kael'thas and Vashj.  Retrieve what remains of them; we will need them as foci to open a gateway to any events tied to Mount Hyjal, recent or ancient.  The outcome of the Battle of Mount Hyjal must be preserved.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Soridormi at Caverns of Time wants you to retrieve Vashj's Vial Remnant from Lady Vashj at Coilfang Reservoir and Kael's Vial Remnant from Kael'thas Sunstrider at Tempest Keep.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I've asked the impossible of you, yet I expect you to succeed. Much depends on it.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The power contained even in this small amount of water from the Well of Eternity is incredible.$b$bI can see clearly into every moment in time linked to Hyjal... the creation of the second Well of Eternity, Illidan's imprisonment, the enchantment of the World Tree and... yes! The Battle of Mount Hyjal.$b$bWe must make haste, the timeline is not safe.</RewardText>
