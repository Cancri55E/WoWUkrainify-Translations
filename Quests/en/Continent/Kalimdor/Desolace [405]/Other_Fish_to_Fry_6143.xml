I'll make the effort worth your while; you think you can help me with that?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 7 Slitherblade Myrmidon, 7 Slitherblade Naga, and 5 Slitherblade Sorceresses, and then talk to Drulzegar at Shadowprey in Desolace.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>As sweet as it is hearing the news that the naga have been vanquished, my heart still feels empty. For the rest of my life I will be dedicated to having them all killed.
