  <Title>The Karnitol Shipwreck</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, friend. Have yerself a seat here...$b$bMy first order of business is for the mage Karnitol--a noble of some sort in Stormwind. Seems his ship was attacked by sea giants while off the coast in the northwest of Desolace. He and his servants tried to bring one of his more valuable chests ashore, but when the sea giants attacked in droves, he chose to abandon it and teleport himself and his servants to safety.$B$BHe wants us to find the chest and its contents, and return it to him in Stormwind.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Karnitol's Chest in Desolace.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You notice the chest does not seem to have any water damage.$B$BThe second thing you notice is that the top has been forced open, and whatever magical traps were set to safeguard it have long been triggered--this much is obvious from the burn marks around its edges.</RewardText>
