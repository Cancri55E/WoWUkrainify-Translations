  <Title>Putting Their Heads Together</Title>
  <Description>So it's true....$b$bThe parchment you discovered in Thunder Axe Fortress details a powerful summoning ritual. One stronger than the Burning Blade have ever been known to possess.$b$bClearly, this rite must be stopped at all costs!$b$bPerhaps if this demon were summoned forth prematurely the crisis could be averted.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 100 Bleached Skulls from Thunder Axe Fortress, place them at the Burning Blade Summoning Circle, then kill Nazargen.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You diverted what would have been a serious crisis, $c.$b$bIf that summoning was delayed just a bit longer, the demon would have become far too powerful for our small forces here to contend with.$b$bPlease accept this gift as our thanks for your service.</RewardText>
