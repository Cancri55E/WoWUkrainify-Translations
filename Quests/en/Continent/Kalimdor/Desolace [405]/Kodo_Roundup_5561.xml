  <Title>Kodo Roundup</Title>
  <Description>Bibbly thinks he is the only goblin in Desolace who knows how to make money.  Well, the only caravan brave enough to travel these parts relies on me.  Ever since I learned how to rejuvenate and control aged kodos with my kodo kombobulator, the caravan owner Cork, Rigger, and I entered a partnership.$B$BTake the kombobulator and use it on any ancient or aged kodos; it will jolt the beast into a tamed kodo and force it to follow you.  Once you have a kodo tamed, bring it back to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 3 Tamed Kodos and the Kodo Kombobulator back to Smeed Scrabblescrew at Scrabblescrew's Camp.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The caravan will be here shortly; do you have the newly tamed kodos I was asking for?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Smeed Scrabblescrew begins counting.&gt;$B$BThree, excellent, I ask for three tamed kodos and I get three tamed kodos... I am going to be rich... yes, very rich! I hope to see the look on Bibbly's green face when he hears about my success!</RewardText>
