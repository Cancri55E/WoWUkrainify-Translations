  <Title>Slitherblade Slaughter</Title>
  <Description>Time and again, the naga have proven to be enemies to the balance of nature. I have no qualms with the spilling of their blood.$b$bYour best efforts though, would barely put a dent in their forces here. Where one falls, two seem to rise in their place.$b$bI have a plan, $c. Your objective is not merely to take the lives of the enemy, but to gather components necessary for the next stage of our investigation....</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Slitherblade Bones from Slitherblade Naga, 30 Slitherblade Scales from Slitherblade Sorceresses, and 4 Slitherblade Fins from Slitherblade Warriors.</LogDescription>
