  <Title>King of Centaur Mountain</Title>
  <Description>We were sent here to track movements of the Kolkar centaur, but after a week of watching these dirty animals scamper all around this oasis, I'm itching to give my axe a taste of their necks. What do you say, $c? Want to cause a little havoc with me?$B$BLet's see if we can attract the attention of their strongest warrior, Kurak.</Description>
  <AreaDescription>Cause Some Trouble</AreaDescription>
  <PortraitGiverName>Kurak</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>His presence is an affront to the senses. Even his flies have flies.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Keep Gorgal Angerscar alive as he starts some trouble with the centaur, and help him to slay Kurak.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Well, I suppose that's one way to track down Kurak. What happened up there?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Aw mon, why you have to go settin' Gorgal off like that? Still, I can't argue with results. We'll need to watch these animals closely to see what they do with Kurak outta the way.$B$BMore watchin' and waitin'. Gorgal won't like that. </RewardText>
