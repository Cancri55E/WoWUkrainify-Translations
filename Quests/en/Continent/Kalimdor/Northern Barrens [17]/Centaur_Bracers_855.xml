  <Title>Centaur Bracers</Title>
  <Description>The centaur leadership relies on a core of trusted, disciplined warriors to keep the others in line. If we reduce their numbers, the Kolkar will have no might with which to support their rage. And so, I have a bounty task for you.$B$BAround the Lushwater Oasis to the south, slay Kolkar Marauders and Stormseers to collect their bracers. Return when you have a heap of these trophies and the Horde will reward you well.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Centaur Bracers from Kolkar Marauders and Stormseers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How goes your hunting, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Nicely done. I'm sure you've struck fear into the surviving centaurs, $n. With their greatest warriors slain, they will either stop their advances or lash out at us in a foolhardy strike.$B$BI hope for the latter.</RewardText>
