  <Title>The Stagnant Oasis</Title>
  <Description>Can what's happening to the south happen here? Judging by what you found at the Forgotten Pools, these oases may be the key. Let's perform an experiment.$B$BHere, take these seeds I've collected from the summit here. They are dead and infertile, but carry them down to the Stagnant Oasis just below us. If there is a fissure there, then place the seeds within it... and observe. Report your findings back to Tonga at the Crossroads.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the dried seeds to investigate the fissures in the Stagnant Oasis.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you been to the Stagnant Oasis? Was there a fissure beneath its waters?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Your findings are amazing! Jerrik was wise to send you there. We now know that whatever rests under these oases can create life from nothing! No doubt this is causing the havoc to the south, but my primary concern right now is preserving the balance up here.$B$BWe must study this more...</RewardText>
