  <Title>Verog the Dervish</Title>
  <Description>Verog may be hard to find, but judging by the info you gathered, his mate Wyneth is always in his command tent just west of here. If we kill her, Verog will come running.$B$BRegthar sent us here to scout, but he also said we should seize any opportunity to upset the centaur chain of command if we can. Lure out Verog and kill him!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Wyneth in order to lure out Verog the Dervish, then slay him and grab his head.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find Verog, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You did it! That'll really upset the balance of power down here. Verog left no clear successor, so I expect this crew of brutes will fall on each other like hungry dogs. I'll stay here and keep an eye on what happens next.$B$BVerog answered directly to the Kolkar Chief - killing him is a good start, but there's more work to be done.</RewardText>
