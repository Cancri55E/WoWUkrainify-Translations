  <Title>Ignition</Title>
  <Description>I don't suppose Sputtervalve sent you? I'm in a bind here. I hopped in without realizing that I need a key to unlock the shredder's movement column. One of the other shredder operators asked me if everything was okay, and I panicked! Instead of telling him that I was missing my key, I told him there was some sort of mechanical problem.$b$bWe need to get out of here on the double! Search the upper level of the derrick, Supervisor Lugwizzle should have a key for this shredder.$b$bHelp me out here!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Get the Ignition Key from Supervisor Lugwizzle.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Quick, we need to get out of here before someone gets suspicious!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Yep, this looks like the right key. Let me just make sure I know how to work this thing...$b$bHmm... rotation control... This regulates speed and stability... fine arm movement control. Just look at this! I can't believe the Venture Company could design something this much better than ours. I've got to get this back to the outpost!</RewardText>
