  <Title>Grol'dom's Missing Kodo</Title>
  <Description>Friend, if you are traveling south to Thorn Hill, I was wondering if you could locate one of our missing kodos? Not every caravan has made it up the pass from Far Watch Post. Those Razormane brutes hijacked a pack animal yesterday morning. It may not still be alive, but if it is, we cannot afford to lose more of our livestock.</Description>
