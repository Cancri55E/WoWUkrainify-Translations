  <Description>&lt;Rocco hands you a familiar-looking shotgun.&gt;$B$BI took the liberty of cleaning up Halga's artillery for you. I'm sure I don't need to warn you about the kickback. Just ask me when you're ready to mount up for the Crossroads! Thork is waiting for you there. Be sure not to give him any lip.$B$BDon't stop for nothing, $n, and if someone gets too close, just give 'em a thump with the butt-end of your gun. Do us proud!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Talk to Rocco Whipshank at Grol'dom Farm and escort his caravan all the way to the Crossroads.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Was that you I saw waving a gun around from the back of my last caravan?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It's about time we got some supplies through here. It's bad enough to be severed from Mulgore, but this city would fall apart if we lost our trade with Orgrimmar.</RewardText>
