  <Title>Read the Manual</Title>
  <Description>Back when I was in the Tinker's Union, Boss Copperplug was the best engineer we had. He defected to the Venture Company shortly before I left, and took his greatest techniques with him. He hoarded his secrets, doling out bits and pieces of knowledge to his trusted inner circle.$B$BIf he built the samophlange, then he's probably got the manual. Last I heard, he was operating right here, out of Boulder Lode mine to the northeast. Get the manual from him, and collect the pages from his followers.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Assemble the Samophlange Manual.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find Copperplug?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You found it! Wow, it's over 600 pages, only 30 of which are intentionally left blank.$B$BLet's see. Chapter three: Backsplicing the Reverse Crankshaft Flywheel Pulley? Interesting. Chapter seven: Valve Timing for the High-Pressure Expansion Condenser!? This stuff is great! And I still don't even know what this thing does.$B$BHere, have some of my old tools. Let's fire this thing up one last time!</RewardText>
