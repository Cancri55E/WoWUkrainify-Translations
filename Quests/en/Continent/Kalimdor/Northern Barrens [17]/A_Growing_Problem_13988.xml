I shall have to see this for myself, but I cannot abandon my post.$B$BHere, $n, I will loan you my 'eyes.' My eagle companion here has served me since I was named. Please accompany him to Thunderhead Summit, where Jerrik awaits, and we will investigate.$B$BTo get to the peak, follow the road east out of the Crossroads. Turn south when you reach a large stone scrawled with paintings.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Tonga's Eyes to Thunderhead Summit southwest of Ratchet.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Tonga knows these lands better than any of us, and I believe it physically hurt him to see it torn asunder.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I am glad Tonga was able to witness the overgrowth firsthand - words can't convey the scope of the damage. Did you bring his totem? I will return it to him when I am finished here.</RewardText>
