  <Title>Altered Beings</Title>
  <Description>It will be important to study both plant and animal life impacted by the oases and the unusual energies you've discovered. The Stagnant Oasis below us is home to a species of snapjaw turtles. Recently their population has exploded. Moreover, the once peaceful animals are growing aggressive, as I learned the hard way before trekking up here.$B$B&lt;Jerrik holds up a bandaged finger.&gt;$B$BI suspect they've been altered by the oases. Collect their shells and take them to Tonga at Crossroads for further study. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 6 Altered Snapjaw Shells from Snapjaws in the Stagnant Oasis.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What else have you brought me?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $n. Studying the beasts of an area can tell much about the area itself. We shall see what tale these shells tell, and possibly unravel the mystery of what's happening in the barrens.$B$BPlease accept my gratitude for your aid... and perhaps you can use these coins. I find that I do not need them.</RewardText>
