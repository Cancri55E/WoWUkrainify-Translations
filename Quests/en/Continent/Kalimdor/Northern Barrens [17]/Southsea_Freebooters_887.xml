  <Title>Southsea Freebooters</Title>
  <Description>Gazlowe promised me a promotion if I can help him with Ratchet's pirate issues. The problem is these new buccaneers that sailed in and took over Fray Island, south of here. They're not just after our goods - they've got grudges to settle! The other night they even went after one of our war galleons.$B$BI've got plans in the works to deal with the situation, but Gazlowe wants to see quick results. Head over to Fray Island and start lopping off some heads, will you?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 Southsea Cutthroats or Privateers on Fray Island.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you swash some buckles, $n? Did you Buccan their neers?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Superb! Gazlowe will reward me handsomely for this. And I'll reward you. Less handsomely, of course. A goblin's got to make a living, you know?</RewardText>
