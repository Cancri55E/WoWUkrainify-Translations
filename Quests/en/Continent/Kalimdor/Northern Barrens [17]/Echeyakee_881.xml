  <Title>Echeyakee</Title>
  <Description>Whitemist, or 'Echeyakee' in the tauren tongue, is the king of the savannah cats. He hunts with such stealth, they say he's like a thin, white mist on the earth. He kills so fast his prey have no time for fear or pain.$B$BThe tauren say he is both mercy and death.$B$B$n, I now set you on the path to hunt Echeyakee. His lair is just northwest of here, on the north side of a small mountain, among the bones of giant Kodo.$B$BGo. Blow this horn when you reach his lair. Blow the horn, and he will come.</Description>
