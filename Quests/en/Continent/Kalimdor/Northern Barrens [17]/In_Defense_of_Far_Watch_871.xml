Some just prove to be more of a nuisance than others.$B$BThe Razormane tribe has been attacking our supply caravans that roll through here from Orgrimmar. I have scouts seeking the leader of these raids, but until then, any losses you can inflict on the filthy pig men would aid us.$B$BStart just south of here, where they've been raiding our camps near the river. Seek them out, and slay them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 Razormane Plunderers and 3 Razormane Hunters.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>...Assaulting our stables? The audacity!$B$BThe destruction in southern barrens has pushed the Razormane up here, and they're been stealing our supplies with renewed ferocity.$B$BThe longer it takes to stop these attacks, the harder it will be to keep the people of the Crossroads armed and fed.</CompletionText>
