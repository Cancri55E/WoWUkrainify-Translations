  <Title>Supplies for the Crossroads</Title>
  <Description>Whatever has happened in Southern Barrens is causing some of the quilboar tribes to flee our direction. The displaced Razormane in particular grow desperate, and their attacks grow bolder. I've lost two caravans this week alone!$B$BOur warriors at the Crossroads desperately need those supplies, and I'm not about to let the quilboar grow fat off of their misdeeds. Find the missing supply crates and bring them to me. I'd search the quilboar hovel south of here, along the river.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 5 Crossroads Supply Crates from inside the Razormane cave.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How goes your search for the supplies, $n? I trust the quilboar fall under your strength easily.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Haha! Thank you, $n! This will help us greatly. I'll get these supplies packed up and on their way to the Crossroads immediately. </RewardText>
