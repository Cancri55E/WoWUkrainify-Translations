  <Title>Wenikee Boltbucket</Title>
  <Description>I think I really put my foot into that one - it looks like I might have knocked one of the load-bearing fluxors into the spokes of the deregulator gear. We can fix this, easy. I know an expert on triple-expansion piston drives who would love to get her hands on a samophlange. Take the broken samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket, just south of Mor'shan Rampart, she'll patch 'er right up.$B$BHey, no need to walk - this gives me the perfect opportunity to test my personal people porter device!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Broken and Battered Samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket. Talk to Brak to teleport directly to her.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I'm very busy with my work, $c.  Unless you have something for me, it'd be best if you moved along...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Oh, what's this? A samophlange, you say? What's a samophlange??$B$BAh... but look at the way it moves when you handle it.  And there's the sound of intricate gears inside. Oh my! I want to fix it and see what it does, don't you??</RewardText>
