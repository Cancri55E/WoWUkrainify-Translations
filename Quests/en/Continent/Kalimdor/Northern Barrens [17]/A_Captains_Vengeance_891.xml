He's boarding or sinking any vessel that doesn't heave-to at his whim.$b$bTravel south along the Merchant Coast to his camp. Bring me the medals of the marines and deck hands. Execute his top Lieutenants, Pyre and Buckland. Lay waste to them as they have laid waste to my fleet!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Theramore Medals from Theramore Marines and Deck Hands. Kill Lieutenants Pyre and Buckland.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Fill my hand with medals from their dead and I will know that vengeance has been given to my fallen privateers.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I see you've made the righteous Rear Admiral suffer as I have. Perhaps this blow will weaken the resolve of Northwatch. His supply of fresh recruits seems inexhaustible, but the loss of his top Lieutenants will weaken him for some time.</RewardText>
