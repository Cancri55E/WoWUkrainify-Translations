  <Title>Return to Samophlanger</Title>
  <Description>Well, that didn't work. The structural integrity of the samophlange is at an all-time low. I could add some more dials to try and fix it, but...that might make things even worse.$B$BLook what I discovered when I blocked the release valve and blew the cover off the differential casing, though: the personal stamp of "Boss Copperplug."$B$BTake this back to Sputtervalve and tell him to find this Copperplug genius. When you're done here, just talk to me and I'll send you back using Brak's teleporter.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take the Re-engineered Samophlange Wreckage back to Sputtervalve at Nozzlepot's Outpost. Talk to Wenikee to port directly to him.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is that my samophlange? I don't even recognize it.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Wenikee said what? Copperplug? BOSS Copperplug? Oh no, this might be tricky.</RewardText>
