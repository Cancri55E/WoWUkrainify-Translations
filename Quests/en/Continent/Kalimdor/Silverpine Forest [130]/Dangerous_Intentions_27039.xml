  <Title>Dangerous Intentions</Title>
  <Description>Do you know why Mortuus appends 'nub' to your name, $n? Because he is an incompetent sycophant that has trouble seeing through his oversized helmet. 'NUB' is your classification. You are now part of the NEW UNDERCITY BATALLION.$B$BBut enough with the comedy! I sent Deathstalker Yorick on a shadow operation two days ago.
