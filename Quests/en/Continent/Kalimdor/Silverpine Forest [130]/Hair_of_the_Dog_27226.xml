  <Description>Thank the Warchief that you're here, $n. I've made a critical error with the sea dogs and need your help to rectify the situation.$B$BYou see, I sent them out against the worgen coming from Fenris Isle stone cold sober. They attacked the beasts and promptly got their butts handed to them. Many of them died, but a few still live, barely clinging on to dear life.$B$BTake this barrel of ale to the Decrepit Fields, east of here, and force it down the throats of fallen sea dogs.</Description>
