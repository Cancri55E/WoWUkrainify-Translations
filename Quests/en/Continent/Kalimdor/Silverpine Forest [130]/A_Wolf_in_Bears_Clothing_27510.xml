  <Title>A Wolf in Bear's Clothing</Title>
  <Description>These worgen take us for fools! One would think that only an idiot would mistake one of their druids in bear form as a real bear. Unfortunately, there are many idiots here at the Forsaken Front. We've already lost a few battalions to organized worgen bear attacks. Yes, it's even more idiotic than it sounds.$B$BDirectly east of here, heading towards Hillsbrad, you will find worgen druids roaming the woods, masquerading as bears. Kill them and make our southern supply line safe again.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Inconspicuous Bears.</LogDescription>
