  <Title>Guts and Gore</Title>
  <Description>If we're to get this new blight up and running we'll need clean beast guts. The problem is that clean beast guts are a rare commodity in Silverpine Forest. Most of the beasts here have succumbed to disease and thus only have diseased organs.$B$BDo a sweep of the forested area east of here for worgs and grizzled bears. Kill only the non-diseased variety and rip out their entrails. Bring me all of the clean guts that you can stuff into your backpack!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover 6 "Clean" Beast Guts.</LogDescription>
