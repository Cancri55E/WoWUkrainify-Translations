  <Title>Practical Vengeance</Title>
  <Description>Under ordinary circumstances I am not a vengeful man. In fact, I am somewhat of a pragmatist. You see, practicality is a paradoxical notion to vengeance. Most revenge ploys are highly impractical.$B$BBUT... in this case - since you're already going to the ruins of Dalaran - you might as well kill every Dalaran affiliated human that you see. The reasons that I want them dead range from hatred to anger to betrayal, but I assure you they are all legitimate gripes. Do this for me and I will pay you handsomely.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill any 12 Dalaran humans.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The people of Dalaran must suffer for what they did to me!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I thought for sure that with the death of a dozen of my most hated enemies I would feel a great burden lifted from my shoulders. Sadly, I do not feel a thing. Perhaps I am a psychopath.</RewardText>
