  <Title>Return to Caregiver Chellan</Title>
  <Description>If I remember correctly, Azure Watch's hippogryph master is Zaldaan.  If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my hippogryphs to him.$B$BThat's a good lesson to know: hippogryphs are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote hippogryph master after you've already been there.$B$BSince you arrived on one of Zaldaan's hippogryphs, you can also use that route to return to Azure Watch with the caregiver's supplies.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Stephanos to purchase a hippogryph ride back to Azure Watch. Once you have arrived, deliver Nurguni's Supplies to Caregiver Chellan.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Welcome back, $N. Was Nurguni able to gather everything on the list?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Handing over the box, you tell the caregive that Nurguni is making arrangements to have the larger items delivered by wagon.&gt;$B$BSplendid! Now, I'll finally be able to set up some beds and a first aid station so that we can better treat the wounded and any survivors we encounter.$B$BI can't thank you enough for your help, $N. You have my thanks and that of the Azure Watch's vindicators.</RewardText>
