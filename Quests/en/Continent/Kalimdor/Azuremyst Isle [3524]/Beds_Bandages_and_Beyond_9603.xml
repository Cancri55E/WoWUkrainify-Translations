  <Description>Welcome to Azure Watch, $c. Please excuse the disorder you see around you. It's easy to take simple things for granted, like a fully furnished and stocked inn, until you're forced to build one from nothing.$B$BWe've managed to salvage this pod for a building, but without the proper furnishings and first aid supplies, the inn is little more than a glorified tent. Nurguni at the Exodar has offered to put together a package to help with our most immediate needs, but I need someone to deliver this list to him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take Chellan's List to the hippogryph master Zaldaan at Azure Watch.</LogDescription>
