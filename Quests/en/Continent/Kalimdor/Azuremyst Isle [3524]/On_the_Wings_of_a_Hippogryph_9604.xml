  <Title>On the Wings of a Hippogryph</Title>
  <Description>For a small fee, you can rent one of my hippogryphs to fly you to the Exodar.$B$BTaking the hippogryph is a faster, not to mention safer, alternative for someone carrying an important message. If you'd like to take a ride, speak to me again and I'll make the arrangements.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Purchase a hippogryph ride to the Exodar from Zaldaan. When you land, take Chellan's List to Nurguni in the Seat of the Naaru at the Exodar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Greetings, friend. You look like you've come a long way. How can I help you?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>So you've brought Chellan's list. Excellent! I was hoping to receive this today. Let's see what she needs.$B$B&lt;Nurguni reads over the list and begins placing various items in a box.&gt;$B$BThat's most of what she requested. The pieces for the beds are simply too large to be delivered by hippogryph, but I'll make arrangements to have them sent by wagon.  </RewardText>
