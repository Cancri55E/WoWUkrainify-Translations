  <Title>Nightstalker Clean Up, Isle 2...</Title>
  <Description>I'm not going to make any excuses for what you've found. This is clearly our fault. We had gotten reports of crushed crystal fragments showing up in the river to the east but chose to ignore the implications. Now we can either sit around on this island and cry about the tragedy that has befallen this land or we can do something about it and prevent it from spreading.$B$BIf you've got the stomach for it, I want you to go back into the wilds and kill as many of the infected nightstalkers as you can find.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch has asked that you slay 8 Infected Nightstalker Runts.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We can't risk this contamination spreading. The reports I've heard come from Blood Watch are bad enough. This has to be stopped now!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I just hope it's not too late...</RewardText>
