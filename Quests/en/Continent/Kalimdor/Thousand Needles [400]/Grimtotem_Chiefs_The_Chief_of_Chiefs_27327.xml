  <Title>Grimtotem Chiefs: The Chief of Chiefs</Title>
  <Description>And now the time has come to take out the leader of all of the Darkcloud Pinnacle Grimtotem: Arnak Grimtotem.$B$BIt is said that he's the disgraced nephew of Magatha Grimtotem, the Elder Crone and matriarch of the Grimtotem clan. Supposedly, his indiscretions have left him in a state of disfavor with her.$B$BBut none of that matters right now. All that matters is that we kill him. For good this time.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Slay Arnak Grimtotem.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>For some reason they all think that you've been sent by Magatha Grimtotem. I know it must have something to do with that wind serpent that's been hanging around.$B$BDoesn't matter. Their leader is dead. It's only a matter of time before the tauren of Freewind Post regain their home.$B$BIf I were them, I'd push back a little to teach the Grimtotem a lesson, but they probably won't. They're tauren.</RewardText>
