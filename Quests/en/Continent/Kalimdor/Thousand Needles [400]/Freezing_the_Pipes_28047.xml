  <Title>Freezing the Pipes</Title>
  <Description>It's time to break out the I-Scream Cryocannon!$B$BWe lifted the tech from the frost cannons on the river boats. If it's one thing that we gnomes are good at, it's miniaturization by way of making everything else that much bigger!$B$BI need you to take the cannon down there into the cave and freeze the pipes we setup in the walls. That'll jumpstart them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the I-Scream Cryocannon to freeze the four pipes inside the cave.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>There are four main pipes already setup in the cave. I need you to freeze each of them so that the refrigerant can start flowing.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Do you hear that, $n? That's the sweet hum of the refrigeration kicking in.$B$BWe'll be able to store our inventory down there in no time. Thank you!</RewardText>
