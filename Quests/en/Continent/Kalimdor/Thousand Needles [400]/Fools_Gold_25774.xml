  <Title>Fool's Gold</Title>
  <Description>We definitely DO NOT have the kind of gold that the Horde is offering. $n, we have to do something or we're not going to be able to get those drilling rights!$B$BWait a minute! There was this report from an underwater survey that we did right after the Cataclysm struck. Something about some gold-looking ore that was pushed up from underground. That's it!$B$BHead west to the old stomping grounds of the centaur, Splithoof Crag and Splithoof Hold, and dig some up.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 Needles Pyrite Ore Chunks.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Once you return with enough of that pyrite, we'll give it a once over with a paint brush, pile it all up on a pallet, and send you back up with it to the chieftain.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Genius! Now, where's that gold paint? I know it's around here somewhere.</RewardText>
