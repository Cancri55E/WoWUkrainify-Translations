  <Title>They Took Our Gnomes</Title>
  <Description>The gnome explosives squad we requested from Tinker Town arrived last week. Just in time to face an assault by the Horde. We lost a lot of soldiers that day. Most of the gnome team was taken as well. Now we're neck deep in Horde, Silverwind Refuge has been lost and we're down a dozen gnomes.$B$BI'm begging for your help here, $n. Travel east to Silverwind Refuge and look for any gnome survivors. They were all carted off by a big, merciless orc named Thundrak. Find him and you'll find our gnomes.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rescue Boog the "Gear Whisperer" and Minx from Painmaster Thundrak's Wagon of Unending Agony.
