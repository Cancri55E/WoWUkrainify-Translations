  <Description>As you've been told by now, we are to escort a diplomat from within the besieged lumber camp to safety.$b$bAs it stands, that's simply impossible. The elves have a thousand arrows trained on the camp's exits.$b$bFirst we must create a diversion - something that will take their eyes off of the camp for a time.$b$bMy idea is simple. Take this axe and cut down the trees they've been nurturing in the region.$b$bWhen you're through, light the brazier here to speak with me again.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Krokk wants you to use the Splintertree Axe to cut down the Ashenvale Oaks in Warsong Lumber Camp.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to chop down the enemy's trees, $c?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Nice work, $n.$b$bYou've demoralized the enemy and harvested resources for the Horde.$b$bLet's hope the rest of the mission goes as well.</RewardText>
