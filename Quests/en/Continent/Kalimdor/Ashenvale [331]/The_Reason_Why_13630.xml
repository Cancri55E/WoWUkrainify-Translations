  <Title>The Reason Why</Title>
  <Description>The furbolg have descended from the heights and overrun the Ruins of Ordil'Aran to the north. I believe they did so because they were attracted to what the dead cultists there uncovered:  three moonstones.$B$BLiladris Moonriver will counsel you to deal with the furbolg in a more direct manner, and I will not gainsay her, but I would ask that you go to the ruins and deactivate the moonstones.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deactivate the Blue, Green, and Red Moonstones.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $n.$B$BWith the moonstones of Ordil'Aran deactivated, we should not need to worry about any further incursions of furbolg here.$B$BHowever, my scouts have returned with disturbing news from the furbolg village. There is an imminent danger massing there.$B$BI wonder, might I entice you to carry a warning to Astranaar for me?</RewardText>
