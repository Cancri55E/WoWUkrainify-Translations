  <Title>To The Ramparts!</Title>
  <Description>These woods may be silent but our enemies lurk behind every trunk. I've discovered many an orc with arrows in his back, his weapon still sheathed.$b$bIt is treacherous here, behind the lines, but we could use strong arms and sharp minds down at the Mor'shan Ramparts. Kadrak is preparing an offensive from there - he prefers action to talk. You and he will get along.$b$bSpeak with me when you are ready and I will fly you there. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Kulg Gorespatter at the Ashenvale/Azshara border to be transported to the Mor'shan Ramparts. Report to Kadrak when you arrive.</LogDescription>
