  <Description>I certainly hope that you're here to help, $c. The situation is as dire as it appears. To put it quite simply, we are losing!$B$BMy girls and I are the last line of defense against the Horde, but we're not going to get out of this one without taking the fight to them. Up for a challenge?$B$BI have a small squad of sentinels that I can loan to you. Get them close and I'm certain that their magic arrows can destroy those wreckers and invaders.$B$BSpeak to me again if you need replacements.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use a squad of Maestra's Post Sentinels to destroy 3 Ashenvale Wreckers and slay 10 Horde Invaders.</LogDescription>
