  <Title>Dread Head Redemption</Title>
  <Description>I sense that Durak is more than he seems. Demonic power is dangerous and it is easy to fall to its corruption - even for a trained warlock. 

I do not trust him, $n.

Find this Durak and tell him that the Horde will have nothing to do with him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Durak in Splintertree Mines.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Carry on.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>As I thought, he was a threat after all. Well done, $n</RewardText>
