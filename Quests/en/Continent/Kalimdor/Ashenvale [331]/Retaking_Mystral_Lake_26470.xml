  <Title>Retaking Mystral Lake</Title>
  <Description>We could easily have held Silverwind Refuge from the Horde had they not taken control of our water elemental defenders on Mystral Lake.$B$BOne of their shaman summoned in Tideress, an old and angry water spirit of the forest who befouled our elementals and turned them against us. With the lake and the Horde pressing in on us, we had no choice but to retreat to the spire here.$B$BGo east. Take the lake back so that we will have a chance to retake the refuge some day.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 12 Befouled Water Elementals and Tideress.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n! With the befouled elemental numbers thinned and Tideress put back into the lake, we should be able to launch a counter-offensive on Silverwind Refuge.$B$B&lt;The sentinel frowns a bit, concern washing over her face.&gt;$B$BJust as soon as we're done with defending the spire....</RewardText>
