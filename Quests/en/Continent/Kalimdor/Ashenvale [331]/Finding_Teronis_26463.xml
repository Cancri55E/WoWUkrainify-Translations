Teronis left days ago, just before the Horde attacked.$B$BHe was searching for an item he thought could slow the furbolg attacks on our people--a rod created by a now-dead, evil wizard.$B$BBefore he left, he mentioned a gem for the rod. Unfortunately, we know that the lake has been invaded by some evil force.$B$BPlease, $n, find my friend.
