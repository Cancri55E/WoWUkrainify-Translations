  <Title>Insane Druids</Title>
  <Description>The druids are dead, killed by their leaders who were driven insane by the Horde tainting the Forest Heart! I can feel the corruption even from here and I dare go no further.$B$BWhile I am too well attuned to Ashenvale and the Forest Heart, you... you could descend into the barrow den and do what must be done. I've laid down breadcrumbs for you in there.$B$BThough it tears me apart, I must ask that you put to rest the druids' once great leaders: Taneel Darkwood, Uthil Mooncall, and Mavoris Cloudsbreak.</Description>

  <RewardText>Rest in peace, my friends.$B$B&lt;You can see the sorrow in the druid cat's eyes.&gt;$B$BI felt the anguish of the Dor'danil Barrows lessen, and knew that you had completed your task.$B$BIt was grim work that you did, $n, for the spirits you destroyed were merely victims of the Horde's evil. But with their destruction, let us hope the maddened spirits will finally find peace.</RewardText>
