  <Title>Between a Rock and a Thistlefur</Title>
  <Description>The Thistlefur furbolgs are threatening our expansion!  Thistlefur Village to our west blocks the way between us here and the Splintertree Post.  It's a path that would circumvent the village of Astranaar; without it, we give the Alliance an extra expansion path.$B$B$n, we must not allow... an expansion path gap!$B$BProceed to Thistlefur Village and thin out the furbolgs.  You will be given compensation for this task, but more importantly you will be doing your duty for the Horde!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Karang Amakkar at Hellscream's Watch wants you to take down any 15 Thistlefur furbolg in Thistlefur Village.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you taken the fight to the Thistlefur?  With a clear path between our bases, our chances of claiming the whole of Ashenvale increase dramatically.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done $c, well done!  I will continue to send forces to thin out the furbolg, but I can at least count on a different path that will be free of Alliance entanglements.  The Horde conquest of Ashenvale is now in full swing!$B$BYou've earned your pay this day, hero.  I salute you!</RewardText>
