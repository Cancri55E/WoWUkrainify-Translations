  <Title>The Goblin Braintrust</Title>
  <Description>If we could just stop the damned bombing from the goblins' creations we'd be able to launch a counter-offensive to take back Silverwind Refuge!$B$BIt's been my experience that goblins are either lazy and unproductive, or too productive and end up killing themselves with their own explosives. Unfortunately for us, they're being motivated by the brilliant Chief Bombgineer Sploder.$B$BGet up to the Skunkworks on the west side of the refuge and don't come back until you have the Chief Bombgineer's head!</Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>Chief Bombgineer Sploder</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>Hopefully his head won't explode!</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Obtain Sploder's Head.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you shut that disgusting, wart-ridden goblin up for good?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That's better. Without him, their technicians are sure to fall back to their normal laziness, which should result in fewer bombs and more accidents.</RewardText>
