  <Title>To Raene Wolfrunner</Title>
  <Description>I would ask you to deliver the gem directly to Raene Wolfrunner. Last I heard, she was still in Astranaar to the southeast.$B$BAt least the road between here and there is still relatively safe, so it should be a simple matter of following it there. Of course, if you'd rather, I believe that Sentinel Avana would be willing to loan you one of her nightsabers to swiftly make the trip.$B$BWhatever you choose, good health to you, $n. May our paths cross again soon.</Description>
