Then they came again and we retreated, over and over.$B$BNo more!$B$BThere is a remnant of the Legion to the south and west in the regions known as Felfire Hill, Demon Fall Canyon and Demon Fall Ridge. They are what is leftover from a force that once long ago invaded this world.$B$BGo and destroy as many as you can before it is too late!</Description>
