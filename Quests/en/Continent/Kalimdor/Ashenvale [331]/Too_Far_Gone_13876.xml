  <Title>Too Far Gone</Title>
  <Description>Yes, I speak your tongue, $r.$B$BWe furbolg have been through this kind of corruption before. Not long ago our leader stole the Idol of Remulos. The demon-tainted thing ensorcelled the entire tribe and our redemption was barely delivered by a druid known as Broll Bearmantle.$B$BBut this time, we did not steal. The trolls of Zoram'gar gave us the charms as a sign of friendship. A deadly friendship it would seem.$B$BOur chief, Dal Bloodclaw, is too far gone. Enter the hold and return with his charms.</Description>

  <CompletionText>Well? The future of the Thistlefur rests upon your shoulders, $r.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>What was done had to be done. As our leader, Dal's sickness from the troll charms was destroying us.$B$BIt was better for the health and dignity of the tribe that it was you, outsider. This way there will be no civil war amongst us and we will easily find new leadership... hopefully one that does not have a tendency to so easily trust outsiders. Perhaps I am guilty of this as well?$B$BHere, allow me to repay the debt we owe you before we part ways forever.</RewardText>
