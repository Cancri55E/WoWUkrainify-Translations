  <Title>Je'neu of the Earthen Ring</Title>
  <Description>The Earthen Ring is a shamanistic group dedicated to studying and preserving the elements.  They have forgotten more about crazy old gods, ancient legends and lore than most scholars will ever know.$B$BLucky for you, I know someone in the Earthen Ring here in Ashenvale.  Head over to Zoram'gar Outpost on the coast of the Zoram Strand; show Je'neu Sancrea what you found.  If anyone can figure out that globe's significance, it'd be him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Befouled Water Globe to Je'neu Sancrea in Blackfathom Deeps.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Ah, hello there. I spend a great deal of time studying the water - all the elements really - so much so that sometimes I don't even notice people around me.$b$bIs there something I can help you with?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This globe... it is most disturbing. Many of the more powerful elementals receive their power and energy through such devices. To find one like this nearly intact is one thing - to find it so tainted is another.$b$bI will see that this globe is studied properly by the Earthen Ring. Perhaps we can bring an end to this corruption of the elements. Please - accept this as a fair exchange for bringing this globe to the attention of the Earthen Ring.</RewardText>
