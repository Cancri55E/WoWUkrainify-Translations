  <Title>Recover the Fallen</Title>
  <Description>I and my sentinels have been ordered by Keeper Ordanus to stay here and hold the tower. So far we've been able to repel the Horde, but now they're going around us to directly attack the retreat to the north.$B$BThe keeper sent out his dryads to defend the tree, but they do not seem to be much of a match for the vanguard of the Warsong orcs.$B$BI need you to go out there and recover as many laughing sister corpses as you can. Take them to Halannia inside the tree at the retreat. She will know what to do.</Description>

  <RewardText>Thank you, $c. We have our hands full defending the retreat, but when I can catch my breath, I'll see to it that these sisters are returned to life, the Goddess willing.$B$BYou've demonstrated your prowess... we can use your help.</RewardText>
