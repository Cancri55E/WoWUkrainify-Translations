  <Title>A Not-So-Charmed Life</Title>
  <Description>The furbolg covet that which does not belong to them.$B$B&lt;Hephaestus turns the charm over in his hand and then discards it.&gt;$B$BThere's a property to the carving that slowly corrupts those that aren't trolls. As I understand it, the furbolg have done this sort of thing before. Some never learn.$B$BNo doubt they hoard most of the charms in Thistlefur Hold above their village to the north.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 Troll Charms.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you think that you retrieved all of the troll charms from Thistlefur Hold?$B$BIf any are left behind, the Thistlefur tribe will continue to be influenced by them, and eventually they will attack this place.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Hephaestus nods slowly as he looks you straight in the eye.&gt;$B$BYou've likely saved the Thistlefur from themselves, at least in the short run.  If they can keep from stealing objects of power that don't belong to them, that is.$B$BI understand that the night elves are having problems with the other furbolg tribe to the south. That's something that Raene is going to want to speak to you about.$B$BHowever, there are more immediate concerns that I would ask for your help with.</RewardText>
