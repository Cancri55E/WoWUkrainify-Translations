  <Description>This is terrible, $n! We got harvesters that ain't harvestin'!

We've been busting our rumps chopping down all these trees, but someone keeps tangling up our machines in the vines! I ain't going out there with those night elves stalkin' around.

See if you can get in there and free up my equipment!</Description>
