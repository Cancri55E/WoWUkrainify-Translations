  <Title>Where Hope Dies</Title>
  <Description>We must carry out the Dark Lady's orders before we are overrun by these newly-invigorated elves.

There is one night elf in particular that we seek. You may remember her from our last venture into Darkshore. Lucky for you, she is already dead... so she should prove less troublesome than the living ones you've already encountered.

Signal me when you find her corpse.</Description>
