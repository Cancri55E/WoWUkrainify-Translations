  <Title>Dark Ranger Round-Up</Title>
  <Description>These night elf ambushes have left us undermanned. We need reinforcements if we are to hold Darkshore.

Brynja, one of the Dark Lady's val'kyr, can provide us with those reinforcements. Slay the night elves and command her to raise them into our service. Should any prove unwilling... deal with them.

Did I not make myself clear? Go. The Dark Lady has plans for these dark rangers.</Description>
