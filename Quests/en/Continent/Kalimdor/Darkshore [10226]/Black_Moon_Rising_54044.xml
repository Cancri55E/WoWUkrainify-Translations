  <Title>Black Moon Rising</Title>
  <Description>Darkshore has never been known for being bright and sunny, but something strange has happened here. A black moon hangs over everything.

None of the scouts I sent into the forest have returned. The night elves are up to something. And I need to know what it is.

Their rank-and-file won't have the information we seek. Hunt down their lieutenants and get them to talk by any means necessary.</Description>
