Big walkin' walls of fur, shakin' the ground... We can't see or hear an ambush creepin' up on our backside.$B$BGo scare 'em off from our patrol, here. Killing a few should drive the herd south and out of what's left of me hair.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 4 Landquaker Kodos and 1 Landquaker Bull in Southern Barrens.</LogDescription>
