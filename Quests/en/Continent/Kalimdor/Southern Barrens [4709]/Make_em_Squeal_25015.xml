  <Title>Make 'em Squeal</Title>
  <Description>One of the native species in Kalimdor is the 'quilboar.' Prickly little buggers. Reason enough to hate this continent.$B$BThe raids started shortly after we established our forward camps. Worse, those spiny fiends seem to thrive in this thorny hell of a jungle. I need you to help beat them back so we can re-establish contact with Forward Command.$B$BWhile you're out there, acquire one of those twisted branches their casters seem to be using to manipulate the jungle growth...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill any combination of 8 Bristleback Bladewardens or Deviate Thornweavers, and collect a Bramblestaff from one of the Thornweavers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I should mention, you're probably going to need a machete to hack through this mess.$B$BThis jungle came out of nowhere!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Corporal Teegan nods as you deliver your report, then grasps the Bramblestaff with both hands.&gt;$B$BSo, this is what the quilboar are using against us? Do you think they used these to create this jungle? </RewardText>
