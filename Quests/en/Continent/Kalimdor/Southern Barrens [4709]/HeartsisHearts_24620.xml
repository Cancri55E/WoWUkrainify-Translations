  <Title>Hearts-is-Hearts</Title>
  <Description>These parts - so lovely! Muscle and sinew and fingers and toes ... I am SO hungry right now.$B$BBut work must come first. Once I stitch this pile of parts together I'm going to need a heart strong enough to pump sludge through this rat's nest of veins. I would use my own heart, but it's a shriveled up husk resembling a turnip.$B$BNo, I need some real power. Get me a kodo heart from one of those giant landquaker bulls to the south of the Battlescar.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay a Landquaker Bull south of the Battlescar and collect an Enormous Kodo Heart.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You've gotta have heart, $n. All you really need is heart.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Calder grasps the gigantic heart in both hands, squeezing it and listening to the valves slurp and squish.&gt;$B$B&lt;His pale mask of a face splits open into an enormous, childlike grin.&gt;$B$BIt is so very important to love one's work, wouldn't you agree, $n?$B$B&lt;Calder chucks the heart over his shoulder into a waist-high pile of entrails.&gt;</RewardText>
