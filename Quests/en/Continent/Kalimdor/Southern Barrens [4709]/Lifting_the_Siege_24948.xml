  <Title>Lifting the Siege</Title>
  <Description>We'll never be able to re-secure the fortress walls so long as Rageroar and his goons have access to artillery. I need you to fight your way across that chasm and take out his big guns.$B$BOrcs season their heavy machinery with coal tar, which makes them flammable. Take my torch and burn any catapults you see north of Northwatch.$B$BThen, torch those big blade-throwers in Rageroar's base camp! Those things have killed enough of our men. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Paxton's Torch to burn 3 Rageroar Catapults and 1 Rageroar Blade Thrower.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Burn it all, $C. Burn it to cinders!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good! Without heavy equipment, the Horde will have to pull back to regroup. We've bought ourselves some time to re-secure the fortress. Well done!</RewardText>
