  <RewardText>&lt;Tolliver grasps the helmet reverently with quivering hands.&gt;$B$BRageroar's battleships intercepted our vessel as we fled from Gilneas. We were to be carried here as trophies to the Warchief. As we neared the shore, some of us fought back. Rageroar - he began killing indiscriminately - howling with laughter.

Few of us made it to land.$B$BAfterwards, I learned that he wore my brother's scalp as... as a trophy.$B$B&lt;He closes his eyes.&gt;</RewardText>
