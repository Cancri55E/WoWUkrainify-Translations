  <Description>$n, you've proven yourself on the Fields of Blood. But the Alliance still threatens our tauren friends.$B$BThe siege machinery outside the gates of Mulgore is like a spear aimed at our heart. I want you to go to the gates, south of here, and remove those siege vehicles from play.$B$BHere, use these stickybombs. They're courtesy of our new goblin allies. It looks as though they stuffed explosive powder into ... what looks like ... grease-covered socks. But they'll do.</Description>
