  <Title>Back in the Fight</Title>
  <Description>This fight isn't over, $c. Not by a long shot.$B$BSome of the soldiers in the courtyard still have breath in their lungs. We can save them! I've soaked these rags in an herbal remedy we used to rely on back in Gilneas. The smell is awful but this poultice can practically raise the dead.$B$BUse these bandages on wounded defenders down in the courtyard and we'll see if we can't get them back in the fight.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Herb-Soaked Bandages on 6 Wounded Defenders.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I hope you have enough bandages. My supply of those herbs was cut off when these brutes sacked my beloved Gilneas.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>A steady stream of the walking wounded have come up the hill to see me, $n. I trust that was your work? Well done!</RewardText>
