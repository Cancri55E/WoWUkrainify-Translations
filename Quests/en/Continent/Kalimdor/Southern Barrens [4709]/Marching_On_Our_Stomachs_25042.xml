  <Title>Marching On Our Stomachs</Title>
  <Description>It's true what they say: An army marches on its stomach. And we've been marching a long way.$B$BI'm thinking if we barbecue up a few of those giant lumbering stormsnouts, we'll have enough meat to feed us for weeks.$B$BStormsnouts are big and slow, so they should be easy to kill. Except... Hey you're not carrying any metal on you are you?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 4 Fresh Stormsnout Steaks by killing Stormsnouts in Southern Barrens. </LogDescription>

  <RewardText>&lt;Sam's eyes bug out of his head as you slam the huge slabs of meat before him.&gt;$B$BOh yeah... oh ... YES! I'll have mine raw. I suppose I can grill some up for the others... How would you like yours?</RewardText>
