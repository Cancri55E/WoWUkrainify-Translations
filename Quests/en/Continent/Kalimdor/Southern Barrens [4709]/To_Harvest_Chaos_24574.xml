  <Title>To Harvest Chaos</Title>
  <Description>If I have truly sown chaos, it is time for reaping.$B$BThe lumbering outgrowths of plant life shamble through the imbued stream here, $n. They are a direct manifestation of the unstable forces mutating this area. Slay as many as you can, and we might be able to slow the spread of the overgrowth further.$B$BAnd while you're at it...be on the lookout for parts of them that appear especially corrupted. Bring any such pieces to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 5 Outgrowths and find a Squirming Heart.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Cutting down the outgrowth will merely buy us some time. Have you found any suspicious pieces?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Naralex slowly takes the squirming heart from you, visibly disturbed.&gt;$B$BI've been a fool. The one truth I did not want to accept has been staring me in the face this entire time...this foul thing is proof of that.$B$BYou and I have much work to do.</RewardText>
