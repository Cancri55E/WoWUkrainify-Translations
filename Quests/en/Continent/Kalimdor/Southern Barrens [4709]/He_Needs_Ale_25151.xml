  <Title>He Needs Ale!</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Marley grasps the side of your head with a shaking, bloody hand.&gt;$B$BAle... Must... have ale...$B$BOl' Barkerstout from inside. &lt;He coughs.&gt; That should ... do the trick.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search Bael'dun Keep for a Mug of Ol' Barkerstout and bring it to Marley Twinbraid at the entrance.   </LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Marley's breathing is ragged, coming and going in shuddering gasps.&gt;$B$B&lt;His eyes look at you imploringly.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Marley's eyes sparkle as you rush toward him with the ale. He grasps the mug in both of his shaking hands and upends it, white foam spilling out over his blood-caked beard.&gt;$B$BAh... that's the stuff. Ol' Barkerstout... Thank you, friend.$B$BThat'll make this... a little easier.$B$B&lt;Coughing one final time, he slumps over the shattered control console, the half-empty mug crashing to the ground and spilling its contents into the sand. His eyes glaze over.&gt;$B$B&lt;Marley Twinbraid is dead.&gt;</RewardText>
