  <Title>Futile Resistance</Title>
  <Description>$n, I certainly don't want to deliver my report to Commander Singleton without at least a little bit of good news. We've got to wrestle control of these roads back from these Horde holdouts.$B$BFrom what we can gather, Kona Thunderwalk is the name of the ringleader. He's got a camp just north of here. A Stonetalon native, he knows these roads better than his own hide. If we can wipe him out, resistance from the west might vanish.$B$BFind and kill Kona Thunderwalk, then report to Commander Singleton!</Description>

  <LogDescription>Slay Kona Thunderwalk on the border between Stonetalon and Southern Barrens.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So our supplies aren't getting through? Hmmm. Honor's Stand just gets more and more isolated.$B$BStill, the defeat of Thunderwalk should send a signal to our foes that we mean to stay. Thank you, $n.</RewardText>
