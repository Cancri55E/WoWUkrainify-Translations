Slay the footsoldiers from Honor's Stand and see if we can't send them scurrying back to their walls.$B$BBe sure to take out at least one of their officers patrolling the road. They need to realize that nobody is safe.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 Honor's Stand Footmen and 1 Honor's Stand Officer.</LogDescription>
