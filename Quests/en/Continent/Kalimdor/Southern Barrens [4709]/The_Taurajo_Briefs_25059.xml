  <Title>The Taurajo Briefs</Title>
  <Description>The General is too preoccupied with the looters in Taurajo. Too soft! We ought to be focused on our next move against the Horde.$B$BThere's valuable intelligence that might be compromised if we allow the ruins of Taurajo to continue to burn. While you're running the General's errand, dig around for any maps or notes you can find. I can speak a little of the orcish tongue - I'll be able to make sense of what you find.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search the Ruins of Taurajo for 3 pieces of Taurajo Intelligence.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you searched the ruins yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>What have you dug up for me? Hmm. Interesting. This notice from Orgrimmar indicates a change in Horde leadership is underway - I guess heads are going to roll after what we did to Taurajo.$B$BWhat's this? A death warrant for the General here! This is good to know... Very good to know...</RewardText>
