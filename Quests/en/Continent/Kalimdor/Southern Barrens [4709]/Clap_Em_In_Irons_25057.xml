  <Title>Clap 'Em In Irons</Title>
  <Description>Our policy of conscripting non-violent criminals from the Stormwind Stockades has come back to haunt us, $n. Some of my less-scrupulous soldiers broke ranks after our victory in Taurajo and are looting the remains of the city.$B$BThis is a breakdown in discipline. Worse, the desecration of their homes only spurs the enemy to fight harder when our ultimate goal should be peace.$B$BTake these manacles and bring the Taurajo looters to justice. Speak to them first, but you may need force to subdue them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to the Taurajo Looters in the Taurajo Ruins and place them under arrest. Use the Northwatch Manacles to subdue 5 wounded looters.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is the Taurajo situation under control?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n. Several of the looters have already crawled back, requesting clemency. I'll let them stew for a bit in the Northwatch brig.$B$BThank you for helping maintain discipline in the ranks. It is important for our army to be perceived as soldiers, not common bandits.</RewardText>
