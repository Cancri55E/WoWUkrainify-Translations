  <Title>Mangletooth</Title>
  <Description>Una here used to spend time in Camp Taurajo. She's told me about a quilboar that used to be captured there, named Mangletooth. Quite the clever one, for a quilboar.$B$BI've been tryin' to think what got these quilboar riled up so much recently, and it might be that Mangletooth escaped Taurajo alive. If he has, he's certainly calling the shots.$B$BThere's a large hut up in the hills to the northwest. If you find Mangletooth there, cut 'im down.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Mangletooth.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That's a relief. Maybe the rest of 'em will keep to their own devices now. The less fighting around here, the better.</RewardText>
