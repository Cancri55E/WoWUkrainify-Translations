  <Title>Winnoa Pineforest</Title>
  <Description>While we've accomplished much here, it would be a tragedy if part of this corruption has escaped our notice.  The corridors of the Wailing Cavern stretch throughout the entire Barrens, and if another spot of wild energy has made its way to the surface...$B$BYou've done enough for me, though. I would simply ask that you let a fellow druid of mine know of what's happened here. You will find Winnoa Pineforest at Vendetta Point, southwest of here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Winnoa Pineforest at Vendetta Point in Southern Barrens.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I could feel what occured from here, $c. It bristled every hair I have.$B$BI'm overjoyed to hear you succeeded in pushing those horrors back, and I'll be sure to scour the area for any stray deviate creatures.</RewardText>
