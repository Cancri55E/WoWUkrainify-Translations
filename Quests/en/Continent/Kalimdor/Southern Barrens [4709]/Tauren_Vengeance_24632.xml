  <Title>Tauren Vengeance</Title>
  <Description>My people are not wrathful by nature, but sometimes a thirst for justice causes us to take up arms in anger.$B$BMy old friend Gann Stonespire, on learning of the butchery in Taurajo, flew into a fury. Tribal elders could no longer hold his rage in check.$B$BNow he has all but parted ways with the Horde. He's gone rogue, $n, and seeks to lash out at the Alliance with a small band of like-minded partisans.$B$BIf you, too, seek vengeance, you will find him southeast of here, at the foot of Bael Modan.</Description>
