  <Title>Diplomacy By Another Means</Title>
  <Description>I have not forgotten my brush with death at the hands of the quilboar in that filthy jungle. The General here has ordered some tactical strikes, but he stops short of genocide. I have no such qualms.$B$BTake this horn that I 'borrowed' during my negotiations. Blow the horn within the Bristleback challenge ring west of our position - you can't miss it. I want you to challenge the champion of the Bristleback, Sabersnout, to single combat. His death in front of his followers will leave them in utter chaos.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Take the Horn of Challenge to the Bristleback Challenge Ring in Southern Barrens. Blow the horn to challenge Sabersnout and kill him.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Sabersnout! Is he dead? What's the news?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>A "Boarpocalypse," you say? These animals certainly have a unique idea of "Single combat!"$B$BNo matter, you've done well. With the quilboar in chaos I should have no trouble convincing the field commanders to execute any strays they find scurrying about. The General need not know we've stepped up the campaign... it's for the better.</RewardText>
