  <Description>The quilboar are attacking because they perceive weakness. Strength is the only language they understand. So we will show them strength.$B$B&lt;Makaba withdraws a large horn from his satchel.&gt;$B$BThis is admittedly crude work but it'll do.

Defeat him in front of his followers. Blow the horn at the Bristleback challenge ring due south of here.</Description>
