  <Title>Warriors' Redemption</Title>
  <Description>Those that surrendered when Honor's Stand fell are no longer worthy of our Horde, $c. But I'm not giving up on them yet. The prison tower below us is lightly guarded. Let's give those prisoners one final chance to die with honor.$B$BI've set up ropes that will allow you to quickly clamber up and down the mountain. Slip down, acquire the confiscated weapons, and re-arm the prisoners inside the tower.$B$BAnd $n, stay by the tower! We're not yet equipped for an assault on the base proper.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Acquire 5 crates of Confiscated Arms from Honor's Stand and re-equip 5 Stonetalon Prisoners. Use the nearby ropes to quickly sneak in and out of the Alliance camp. </LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It is a dangerous climb up and down the cliffs, but our ability to appear and disappear without warning is what will drive terror into the hearts of our foes.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>From up here I got the perfect view of the havoc you just caused, $n. Our lost brothers reclaimed some of their dignity, and the Alliance dogs were sent scrambling. Sharp work, my friend!$B$BIf the Alliance sleeps comfortably at night, we are not doing our job.$B$BWe will never let up.$B$BWe will never give in.</RewardText>
