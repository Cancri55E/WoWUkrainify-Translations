  <Title>The Nightmare Scar</Title>
  <Description>This confirms it. The overgrowth here is not being caused by a mere overabundance of energy.$B$BDo you understand? This is beyond what happened at the Wailing Caverns now. A rift into the Nightmare must have torn open in the middle of the very land we're standing on! And to think it's my fault...$B$BI'm done picking at the edges of this wound. Go to the west, to the center of the overgrowth, and meet me again there. We will dive into the heart of this corruption and force it shut!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Naralex seal the Nightmare Scar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We must not allow the nightmare to spread further into our world!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We've done it! The nightmare's connection to this place has been severed. The rest of the land is safe from this intrusion now, and in time, the abberations here will be subsumed by the balance of nature.$B$BI cannot thank you enough, $n. By helping to restore order here, you've let me make amends for my foolish actions.</RewardText>
