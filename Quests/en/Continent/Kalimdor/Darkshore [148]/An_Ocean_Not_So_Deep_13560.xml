  <Title>An Ocean Not So Deep</Title>
  <Description>You look like an able sort!$B$BThere are a great number of wrecks off of the coast here... most old, some new. For quite some time, I've been trying to get at their holds and put their valuables to more use, but there's a nasty infestation of murlocs that seem to have other ideas. I've sent scores of adventurers and none have returned.$B$BWorry not, I've learned my lesson, and that is not your fate. Swim to the due north and look for Gary. He'll explain the new plan. It's pretty simple really.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gorbold Steelhand at Lor'danel wants you to speak to Gary for further instructions.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The decoys worked then? Great to hear it! Don't you worry yourself one bit about the treasures. Me and Gary will take care of the rest this time around.$B$BTruth be told, if something went wrong again and I lost any more of you adventurer types, I'm pretty sure they'd kick me out of town. </RewardText>
