  <Title>The Last Wave of Survivors</Title>
  <Description>It's too late for Laird, he didn't make it in time.$B$BThe last wave of night elves from Auberdine attempted to escape a couple of hours ago. They stayed in their old home, clinging to the hope that it could be salvaged, but it seems they were finally forced out. I fear many of them won't make it, like Laird did not.$B$BQuickly, go down the coast to the west and find any survivors that you can. We're sending Sentinels and Hippogryphs down, but every moment counts - we need to know which ones might make it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate any refugees from Auberdine that are still alive.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Their pride kept them in Auberdine for this long, but none deserve such a cruel fate.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $c. Some of them surely would not have made it without you.$B$BWe'll be taking the wounded to the main building once we have them all safely back in town. Perhaps you can meet us there later?</RewardText>
