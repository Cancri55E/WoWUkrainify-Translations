  <Title>A Troubling Prescription</Title>
  <Description>A crude, hastily-assembled apothecary's workbench stands here, heaped with scrawled notes and noxious brews. It looks as though the Forsaken have also been studying Foulhoof's handiwork. You grab the most important-looking notes and prepare to smash the laboratory before notifying Treetender of your discovery.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver the Apothecary's notes to Tharnariun Treetender in Lor'danel.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What's this? You found something else in the cave?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Tharnariun Treetender pages through the notes as you relate your story, the lines in his face deepening with concern.&gt;$b$bSo the Forsaken have been studying Foulhoof's work? My gut crawls at the thought of what they might have done were they able to weaponize his corruption. You've done well to destroy their work, but this raises deeper concerns. What brought the Forsaken to our doorstep? Are they working with the Shatterspear trolls to our north? Sorrows are heaping upon sorrows, $c. I'm glad you're here.</RewardText>
