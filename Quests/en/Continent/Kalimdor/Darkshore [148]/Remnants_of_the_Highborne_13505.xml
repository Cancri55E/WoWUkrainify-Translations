  <Title>Remnants of the Highborne</Title>
  <Description>There are several ruins similar to these spread through Darkshore, many of them inhabited by the troubled spirits of the Highborne. Out of mild courtesy for their cursed souls, we haven't been overly proactive about stripping the ruins of artifacts, but those hesitancies vanish in light of this new troll threat.$B$BWhile you're aiding the Sentinels in their goals within the ruins, please collect any artifacts that you stumble upon and bring them back to me. I would like to preserve what little I can.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve 8 Highborne Relics.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to recover any artifacts?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Perfect! Thank you so much. I would hate to lose more records of our culture to war - far too much has been sacrificed already.</RewardText>
