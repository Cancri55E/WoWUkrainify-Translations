  <Title>Swamped Secrets</Title>
  <Description>Underneath Remtravel's forgetful exterior is the mind of a genius, an enigma cloaked in senility. But I'm not about to give up on the old man. Look at what I found in his notes... not there... no, that's a shopping list... Here, on the page where he's trying to figure out what year it is: The Disc!$B$BWe think this Titan artifact is some sort of encrypted storage wheel. We were carefully unearthing it when the disaster hit, but hopefully it's still in the ruins. Dive in and grab it for me! </Description>
  <LogDescription>Find a Mud-Crusted Ancient Disc from within the nearby ruins.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find it? Groff wants to clear out of these ruins as soon as possible!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Spectacular! Good work, $n. I'm sure Remtravel would thank you himself if he could remember your name.$B$BLook at the surface of the disc - these microscopic etchings - this is amazing. I'm certain this strange wheel holds information, if only we could read it...</RewardText>
