  <Title>Sweeping Clean the Ruins</Title>
  <Description>The big beards at Ironforge sent me here to check on Remtravel's dig the moment they got word of the disaster. Look at it! Precious artifacts washed to sea, months of tedious digging undone in a moment.$B$BWhen the tidal waves hit, they demolished the murloc encampments along the shore. Good news? Naw, not with my luck. The survivors are squatting in the shelter of the ruins, and they're doing more damage than the elements ever could. Would you mind getting your waders on and taking care of things?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 of any combination of Greymist Oracles or Greymist Refugees squatting within Remtravel's Excavation.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Bravo, $n! Now let's take a look-see at our new situation.$B$BWhat? MORE murlocs? I swear on my stones, the more murlocs you kill, the more murlocs appear. Is it just me? We're going to need a new approach.</RewardText>
