  <Title>An Ounce of Prevention</Title>
  <Description>Are you familiar with the Old Ones, $n? Onu and I agree that the artifact you found in the lake can only be their work, and it's devouring Darkshore. Something is stirring up terrors we thought dead long ago. This is bigger than you or me, but my first concern is protecting the wildlife.$B$BHere, this sapling contains the life essence you gathered for me. I believe it can protect the local fauna. Test it out on a nearby un-consumed bear, stag, or moonstalker, and let me know what happens!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Test the Lifebringer Sapling on any nearby healthy Grizzled Thistle Bear, Whitetail Stag, or Moonstalker Matriarch/Sire. </LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The sapling you carry grows in power even as we speak. Life is regenerative, $n. Did it work?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Interesting... It sounds like our cure will keep the wildlife safe, but you say you saw something else? Some kind of angry presence?$B$BThis is a good sign, $n. Whatever is behind this isn't happy, and that means we're on to something.  </RewardText>
