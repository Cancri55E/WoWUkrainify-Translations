  <Title>Grimclaw's Return</Title>
  <Description>With the binding complete, the blessing has taken hold. It will most certainly make your travels in these lands easier.$B$BGrimclaw made a full recovery. Before I could do anything to stop him, he bolted off towards Lor'danel. I suppose that means it's time for your departure.$B$BIt was a great pleasure to have met you. For now, farewell - send my best wishes to Volcor and Grimclaw.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Volcor and Grimclaw in Lor'danel.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You've returned! It is good to see you again. I suppose we have you to thank for Grimclaw's return?$B$BI'm afraid... I have some bad news. I've been unable to purge the toxin... their conditions worsen. Gershalla died shortly after you left, and Volcor... Volcor passed just before you came back.$B$BHe lived long enough to see Grimclaw come back safely, so he died with a smile on his face. I'm just sorry that I couldn't do more.$B$BFor now, I'm doing everything I can to save Shaldyn, so please excuse me.</RewardText>
