  <Title>Unsavory Remedies</Title>
  <Description>I have no doubts that Grimclaw will recover with the help of my healing magics, though I can't say the same for the poachers that attacked him. Still, I could use some salve to close his wounds and lessen his pain while he heals.$B$BTo the east you will find the Ruins of Lornesta. Among the crumbled stones, there is a variety of fuming toadstool that flourishes in the damp environment. Bring me some of the toadstools so that I can mix a salve for our friend here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover 6 Fuming Toadstools.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Grimclaw is quite the fierce combatant. I feel somewhat sorry for those poachers, despite their aims.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You have my thanks, young one. We should be able to speed Grimclaw's recovery dramatically with this salve.</RewardText>
