  <Title>The Titans' Terminal</Title>
  <Description>Now that we have the disc, a lot of our earlier finds are starting to make sense. Shortly after my arrival, Prospector Remtravel unearthed what he presumed to be a prehistoric toaster.$B$BIt's my belief that this slotted box is some sort of data reader. Unfortunately, it broke apart and washed away with the rest of our base camp when the tidal wave struck!$B$BIt can't have gone far, $n. Pieces must be buried in the nearby sand. Here, use my trusty buried artifact detector to comb the beach for them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Buried Artifact Detector on the beach near Remtravel's Excavation site to locate 5 Ancient Device Fragments. Combine them to create the Ancient Slotted Device.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you assemble all the pieces of the slotted device? We may need to remove Prospector Remtravel's sandwich from the ancient data interface.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Why yes, yes, this is it! See here, the slot is the exact dimensions of the ancient disc, just as I'd surmised. Here's your reward, $n - you've earned it.$B$B&lt;Jr. Archaeologist Ferd upends the device and pours mud and garbage from the slot.&gt;$B$BAre you ready to meet history face to face? Let's see what the ancients have to say! </RewardText>
