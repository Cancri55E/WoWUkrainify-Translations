  <Title>Threat from the Water</Title>
  <Description>Some of the survivors of this last Auberdine attack are still trying to make it up the coast to safety. We only caught word that they were coming within the last hour. I wish that we had more warning...$B$BThe coastline west of us is swarming with vile spray, vicious little water elementals. We need to clear them out if any of the survivors are to have a chance of making it to Lor'danel. Depart immediately and kill every elemental you see.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 Vile Spray.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Your efforts are very much appreciated. Since the Cataclysm, the elementals have been out of control. We have little hope of taking back Auberdine without extinguishing their presence first.</RewardText>
