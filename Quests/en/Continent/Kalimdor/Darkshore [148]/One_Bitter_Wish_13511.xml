  <Title>One Bitter Wish</Title>
  <Description>Morra sent you? I should have listened to her - it's just hard to take trolls seriously I guess.$B$B&lt;Alanndarian lets out a weak chuckle.&gt;$B$BIt's way too late for that anyway. We're mortal now... this is the fate we have to face, one way or another. I've had time to accept that.$B$BI have one request though... kill the torturer that did this to me. They call him Rit'ko... you can find him just ahead with the other prisoner.$B$B&lt;Alanndarian offers a small smile, then winces and slumps back over in pain.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Rit'ko, the Shatterspear Torturer.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Alanndarian is dead then. That saddens me greatly, but it is not entirely unexpected. I expect no mercy from these savages, and will show them none.</RewardText>
