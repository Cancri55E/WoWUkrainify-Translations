  <Title>The Shatterspear Invaders</Title>
  <Description>If we didn't have enough on our hands with the land and the elements turning against us, it seems something has riled up the trolls to the northeast, and they've started on a war path. I'm not sure what their aims are, but they've already attacked several of our scouts and have besieged the cultists at the Tower of Althalaxx.$B$BWe've sent a contingent of our best Sentinels to counter their attacks. If you would travel northeast to the ruins and join them, I'm certain that they could use the extra hand.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Report to Lieutenant Morra Starbreeze at the Ruins of Mathystra.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Glynda sent you to lend a hand, did she? I'm glad she did - I could certainly use the help.$B$BI'm working on our initial plans to start whittling away at their ranks. Please feel free to help Tysha and Balthule in the meantime.</RewardText>
