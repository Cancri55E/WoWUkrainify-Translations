  <Description>I've flown through the ruins of Auberdine on a scouting mission. There are three Twilight's Hammer cultists that are responsible for the elementals that have overrun the destroyed town.$B$BHead west into the ruins. Seek out and slay Cloudtamer Wildmane, Windmaster Tzu-Tzu, and Skylord Braax.$B$BOnly then will Sentinel Selarin and her forces stand a chance of taking back their home.</Description>
