  <Title>The Boon of the Seas</Title>
  <Description>It is good to see you. You were key in ensuring that our loved ones made it home, and I hold some hope that you may yet help us further.$B$BLike Laird, their wounds will be grave - every one of them battered by the coast and assaulted by the elementals. I am doing what I can, but it seems that those elementals hosted a toxin that is weakening their ability to heal. I believe I can concoct a salve, but I will need secretion from the muscles of the clams that inhabit this coast. Can you help me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 16 Encrusted Clam Muscles.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you bring muscles from the clams? I worry that our time grows very short.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This will do perfectly. Thank you so much!$B$BI suspect they will want to thank you personally should they recover, so perhaps you can stop by later on.</RewardText>
