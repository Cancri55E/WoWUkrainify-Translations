  <Title>Malfurion's Return</Title>
  <Description>It was only recently that we heard the news of Malfurion's awakening, mere moments before the Cataclysm occurred.$B$BAs soon as he regained consciousness, he gave a cryptic warning about the land splitting in two if something wasn't done and how all the shockwaves were converging here on Darkshore.$B$BHe then reportedly set off for somewhere in this vicinity.  I was sent here to find him, but I've found my hands full helping the refugees.$B$BPerhaps you could look for him to the southeast for us.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Look for Malfurion Stormrage at the Eye of the Vortex southeast of the Refugee Camp in Darkshore.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>There is no time to waste, $c.  It is taking every ounce of my power to keep Darkshore's entire landmass from being shattered and swept into the ocean... you must listen to me very carefully.</RewardText>
