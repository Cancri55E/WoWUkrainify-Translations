  <Title>A Cure In The Dark</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Some unintelligible speech spews forth from the machine before you make out Wizbang's voice again.&gt;$B$BDuskrats! They've been eating the duskrats! Those little buggers only come from one place, a cave against the cliff-face to the east. Find a path up to the northeast and look for an opening under the waterfall.$B$BThe duskrats there are either getting into something nasty or someone's intentionally spreading some agent through them - in either case, just bring me back several samples of the stuff!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve 6 Samples of Foul Ichor from the creatures inside Cliffspring Hollow.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get to the stuff? The sooner I can start working on a cure, the more animals we can save!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This should be plenty! Thanks so much! I'll get working on a cure for this nastiness immediately.</RewardText>
