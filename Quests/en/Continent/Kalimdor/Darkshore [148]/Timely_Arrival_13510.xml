  <Title>Timely Arrival</Title>
  <Description>It's good to see you. I wasn't looking forward to enduring what Alanndarian did, so the rescue is somewhat welcome.$B$BI saw the troll leader before I was captured, and thought I had the perfect opportunity to kill him, but he's protected by some sort of magic shield. Morra needs to know before she mounts her assault, but first, we need to get out of here.$B$BHelp me to the dock - I'll make my way to Lor'danel via water, and you can go back to Morra with the intel.</Description>
  <AreaDescription>Escort Sentinel Aynasha to the Dock</AreaDescription>
  <LogDescription>Escort Sentinel Aynasha to safety.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Report to Morra Starbreeze at the Ruins of Mathystra.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Some sort of shield you say? We might have a way around that. Balthule had an idea for breaking whatever protective enchantments their shaman had, so it might work on this too. Thank you for saving Aynasha and bringing me this information - it may well make the difference in our battle.</RewardText>
