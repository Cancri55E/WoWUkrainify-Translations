  <Title>Buzzbox 723</Title>
  <Description>There are a couple other forms of wildlife that we've verified infected. It's actually good news that the crabs appear to have caught this from the bears - hopefully that means this all stems from one source. We need to focus our attention on those bears now.$B$BBuzzbox 723 is near the waterfalls to the east. It's going to be messy work, but it's necessary - I'll need you to bring some fresh bear guts to that buzzbox for analysis. We'll go from there once I have the information.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 6 samples of Corrupted Thistle Bear Guts and bring them to Buzzbox 723 for analysis.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Buzzbox 723 hums at you expectantly.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Static precedes Wizbang's distorted voice.&gt;$B$BThe results are coming in now. We should have some information on how the bears contracted this in just a moment.</RewardText>
