  <Description>To the southwest lies the corpse of a being somehow related to the Old Gods that the Twilight's Hammer cultists worship.$B$BHe was defeated before our time -- if not by the Titans themselves, certainly by one of their creations.$B$BWe've noted an increase in cult activity in that area which can only mean something terrible is amiss.$B$BWe're going to need to find out what they're planning to do there and why.  Take this figurine, it'll help you avoid being detected while you gather intelligence.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Sneak into the Master's Glaive using the Panther Figurine and spy on the Twilight's Hammer.</LogDescription>
