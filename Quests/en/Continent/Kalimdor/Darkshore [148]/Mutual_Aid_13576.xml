  <Title>Mutual Aid</Title>
  <Description>With most of our brethren losing their way to madness or corruption, it would seem that we have little choice but to ally with you, $r.  You can count on our aid... once you've proven we can count on yours.$B$BAs you can see, my people are having a bit of a problem with the fire elementals.  Help fight them and use this totem on their fiery remains.$B$BWe will return them to where they belong... whether they like it or not.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Soothing Totem to absorb the remains of 8 Unbound Fire Elementals.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The element of fire is unique in that attacking it indiscriminately can often lead it to spreading further... succeeding only in agitating its flames.$B$BWe are wiser than that, $n.  We are going to dispose of it properly.</RewardText>
