  <Title>Spirit of the Moonstalker</Title>
  <Description>In these woods reside three great spirits, that of the Stag, that of the Thistle Bear, and that of the Moonstalker. These spirits make powerful allies, but you can only align yourself with one of them.$B$BIf you wish to align yourself with the Great Moonstalker Spirit, take this incense to the land just south of the Ruins of Lornesta. Meditate before the great spirit while burning the incense on the ground between you, and face his trial to earn his blessing. Should you succeed, return to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Keeper Karithus has instructed you to receive the blessing of the Great Moonstalker Spirit.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I share these forests willingly, accepting night elf kind into my home, and on occasion calling them friend. Though they have been tainted greatly in recent memory, I can see in you the same strength, honor, and spirit that first endeared them to me.$B$BIf you place value in the ferocity necessary to overcome all odds, then I am willing to call you my champion. Know now that if you side with my kind, the other spirits will not accept you, so consider your choice carefully.</RewardText>
