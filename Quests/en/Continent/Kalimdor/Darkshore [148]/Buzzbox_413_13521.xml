  <Title>Buzzbox 413</Title>
  <Description>Greetings!$B$BI'm helping Tharnariun here try to unravel what's been corrupting the wildlife in the area. I've set up some machines in the field that can analyze animal parts and possible corruption agents. If you can get me some good samples, we can get to the bottom of this affliction quickly.$B$BThe first machine is Buzzbox 413. I set it up on the beach just east of town. I'll need you to gather some flesh from the nearby corrupted tide crawlers and bring it to the machine so that I can analyze it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 4 Corrupted Tide Crawler Flesh samples and bring them to Buzzbox 413 for analysis.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Buzzbox 413 hums at you expectantly.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The machine crackles loudly, and then Wizbang's static-ridden voice becomes audible.&gt;$B$BLovely! I hope you didn't kill too many of them. We're not trying to wipe out the population, we just need to get to the source of this corruption quickly! I'm proceeding with the analysis now.</RewardText>
