  <Title>Writings of the Void</Title>
  <Description>The scrolls are vague and appear to be a piece of a much larger puzzle, but if you are not mistaken, they seem to reveal some of the steps on the path to becoming a demon hunter.$B$BThe dark oaths and rituals necessary for becoming a demon hunter are frowned on by most of the night elves, so this is likely something they would be very interested in keeping quiet.$B$BRanger Glynda Nal'Shea will know what to do with these scrolls.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Writings of the Dark Herald to Ranger Glynda Nal'Shea at Lor'danel.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How can I help you, $c?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Where did you find these?! You haven't shown them to anyone else, have you?$B$BI apologize. You took me off guard. Telarius was a very powerful Demon Hunter, but he was slain during a confrontation with the warden, Maiev, many years ago. You are fortunate that his ghost was only a shade of his former power. I wonder how many have found their way to him in those ruins.$B$BI will see to it that these scrolls make their way to the high priestess immediately. Thank you, $n.</RewardText>
