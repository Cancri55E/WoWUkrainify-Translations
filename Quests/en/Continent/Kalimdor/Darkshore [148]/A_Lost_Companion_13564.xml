  <Title>A Lost Companion</Title>
  <Description>Please help... I can barely sit up.$B$BMy friend, a bear named Grimclaw, he's not here. I sent him ahead to let the Sentinels know we were coming before we left Auberdine, but he never arrived. I sensed something might be amiss as we were leaving, but with the evacuation, I never had a chance to act on it.$B$BIf he's injured, there's only one place that he would go - the Withering Thicket, north of Auberdine, down the road to the south from here. Bring him back to me safely... he's my only family.</Description>

  <RewardText>Greetings, traveler. You seem to have an interest in my friend here. You're here on behalf of his friend Volcor then I imagine? If Volcor didn't come himself, he must be injured as well. I hope he recovers quickly.$B$BGrimclaw is too injured to be moved far and he's going to need some immediate treatment. I'm afraid I can't let you take him back just yet, but perhaps you can help me while I tend to him. </RewardText>
