  <Title>The Front Line</Title>
  <Description>Their forces are weakened, their supplies destroyed, and their subleaders are dead. It is time for us to take this fight to their home, and their leader. I'm admittedly still in the dark as to what spurred their sudden aggression, but perhaps we will find some answers on their doorstep.$B$BTake this arrow that Balthule prepared and report to Sandrya Moonfall deep in Shatterspear Vale to join the attack. It would be best to secure a ride on one of our nightsabers - going on foot would be dangerous.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Report to Huntress Sandrya Moonfall deep in Shatterspear Vale.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Greetings, $c. Did you bring the arrow?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It is good to meet you. Word has been sent to me of the efforts you have made to aid us against the trolls, and I must admit I am a bit impressed. The final fight is upon us now, I hope you are prepared.</RewardText>
