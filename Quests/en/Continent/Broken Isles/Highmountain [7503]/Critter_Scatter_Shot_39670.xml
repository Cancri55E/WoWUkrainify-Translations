  <Title>Critter Scatter Shot</Title>
  <Description>The howlers in these hills travel in packs. Three against one isn't a fight I want to pick.

Luckily those wolves are no match for my engineering skills! I just put the finishing touches on the prototype of a device that will help scatter the pack. All I need now is some ammo...

Snatch me some rabbits from the meadow south of here, and I'll let you be the first to try out the hand cannon.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Catch rabbits in Sunfrost Glade.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you snatched the rabbits yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hrm, these rabbits are a bit bigger than I thought, but we should still be able to stuff a few of them into the hand cannon.</RewardText>
