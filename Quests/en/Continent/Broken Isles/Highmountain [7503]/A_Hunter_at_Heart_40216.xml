  <Title>A Hunter at Heart</Title>
  <Description>Addie's one heck of a writer, but I've never seen her hold a rifle. She's keen on learning how to hunt, but who's ever heard of a gnome hunter? 

You seem to have a knack dealin' with amateurs, so maybe you'd be willin' to let the gnome tag along on a hunt? She could learn a thing or two by shadowing someone with your skill.

Ya best start off with some small game. We don't want the lass to get discouraged.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Addie learn to hunt by killing wildlife in Pinerock Basin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Keep an eye on the gnome while you're huntin'. She's never held a rifle before.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You haven't got any holes in ya, I guess that means Addie's aim isn't as bad as I thought!</RewardText>
