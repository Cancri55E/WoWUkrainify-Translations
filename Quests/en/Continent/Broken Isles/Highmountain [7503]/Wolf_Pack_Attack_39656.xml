  <Title>Wolf Pack Attack</Title>
  <Description>It's time to attack the pack! I've preloaded the hand cannon. All you have to do is point and shoot.

The critters should survive the blast and hit the ground running. The howlers will be distracted by the critters, allowing you to focus on killing the packleaders.

Happy hunting!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Shoot the Critter Hand Cannon near wolf packs so that they scatter, allowing the packleaders to be singled out.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The critter hand cannon is loaded and ready for use! Just aim for one of the packs nearby. The packleaders should be easy to kill once the howlers are distracted.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You made it back without any scratches. It looks like the backfire issue from the last prototype worked itself out.$b$bA few more tweaks and I'd say this hand cannon is ready for mass production. Thanks for the help, $n.</RewardText>
