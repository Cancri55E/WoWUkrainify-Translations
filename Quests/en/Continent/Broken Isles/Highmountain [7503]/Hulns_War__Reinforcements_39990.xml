  <Title>Huln's War - Reinforcements</Title>
  <Description>Cenarius himself has risked much in coming here, if only briefly, to bestow a blessing upon you. He has seen what you are capable of, and has chosen you as champion in this battle. I would speak with you on this later. It is a rare gift indeed.

But now, I ask for your help, Huln Highmountain. I must finish my incantations to allow dryads from beyond the veil to enter this place and lend us their aid.</Description>
