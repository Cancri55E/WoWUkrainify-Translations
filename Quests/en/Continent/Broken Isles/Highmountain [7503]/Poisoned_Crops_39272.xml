  <Title>Poisoned Crops</Title>
  <Description>After driving us from the farmland and infesting our crops with insects, the drogbar placed wicked totems that further poison our harvest.

I can only hope that if you destroy them, we'll be able to heal the land using Jale's water magic.

Thank you for coming to help us, $n. We are but simple farmers and fishermen, and have little prowess in combat.</Description>

  <RewardText>Thank you, $r. Some of the crops still live. I believe with hard work and some of Jale's magical waters, we will not lose the entire harvest.</RewardText>
