  <Title>Witch of the Wood</Title>
  <Description>You saved me at Riverbend not long ago. It is the reason I vouched for you as emissary to this tribe, and the only reason you're alive here now. I consider my debt to you paid.

You must prove yourself to the Bloodtotem chieftain before he will speak with you.

Within the forest is the Witch of the Wood, a harpy mother who recently descended into this territory. If you are able to defeat her and show her carcass to the Bloodtotem, they might allow you an audience with Torok.</Description>
