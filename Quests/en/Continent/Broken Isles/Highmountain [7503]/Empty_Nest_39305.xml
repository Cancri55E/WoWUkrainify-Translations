  <Title>Empty Nest</Title>
  <Description>I've taken an inventory of the eggs you recovered. Some among the bunch may still have a chance to hatch.

They will need to be returned to an empty nest, and with any luck, an eagle will claim the eggs as her own and watch over them once again.

There is a nest just outside the entrance, on a rocky ledge above the cave.

Be careful, $n. The eggs are very delicate.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place the eagle eggs in the empty nest above the eastern entrance to Rockcrawler Chasm.</LogDescription>
