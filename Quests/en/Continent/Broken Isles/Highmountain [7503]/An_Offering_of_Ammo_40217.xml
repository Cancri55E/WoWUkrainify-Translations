  <Title>An Offering of Ammo</Title>
  <Description>The mountains have seen many new travelers pass through their valleys, some without an understanding of our traditions.

Our leaders have turned their focus to more pressing matters, but Losro and I cannot ignore the recent arrival of hunters in the nearby basin.

They hunt with guns and gadgets, forgoing the experience of hunting with a bow and arrow.

While I know that some will remain stuck in their ways, perhaps an offering of arrows will encourage these outsiders to hunt the way we always have.</Description>

  <RewardText>We gave up usin' that kind of ammo long ago! Don't worry though, we won't let the gift go to waste. I'm sure we can use the arrows for kindling.</RewardText>
