  <Title>Shiny, But Deadly</Title>
  <Description>Soulkeeper Uriah and I were transporting demon prisoners to Allari in Azsuna when our caravan was attacked by kobolds.

Those mindless vermin made off with the soul chambers that house our demonic captives.

The crystals may be shiny, but they're also deadly. If they are damaged in any way, the demons trapped within may escape.

Head into the cave nearby and recover the soul chambers before it's too late.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect Soul Chambers from kobolds within Mucksnout Den.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you recovered the soul chambers yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Is this all you could find?$b$bWhile I'm grateful to have these gems in my possession once again, it seems that there are still a few missing. I fear they've been broken, which means the demons within have escaped.</RewardText>
