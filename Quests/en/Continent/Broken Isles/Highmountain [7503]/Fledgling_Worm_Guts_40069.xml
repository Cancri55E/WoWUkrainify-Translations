  <Title>Fledgling Worm Guts</Title>
  <Description>The drogbar use these caves as a place to train fledgling worms.

The rockcrawlers are young and fairly weak, for now, but in time they will grow in size and strength. Without our intervention, the worms will morph into the monstrosities that the drogbar ride into battle.

Their guts are also known to be quite useful, and I have need of them. Two worms, one stone.</Description>
