  <Title>A Fool's Errand</Title>
  <Description>Oh yea sure, I'm, um, held here against my, you know, will, or something.

Look bud, between you and me old Max here has no chance, but his heart is in the right place. I keep trying to run away and hide but he keeps finding me! I just don't have it in me to upset him with the truth.

I've got an idea. Why don't you go kill some of those really big two headed "Hill Bandits" for me. Let's say they stole some jewelery from me, and you can use it to buy my freedom.

Take your time, don't get hurt. Much.</Description>
