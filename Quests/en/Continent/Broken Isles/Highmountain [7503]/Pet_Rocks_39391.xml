  <Title>Pet Rocks</Title>
  <Description>I raise creatures born of the earth to help defend myself and my people. When I was captured, I ordered them to stay behind at our home, but they are often disobedient and likely tried to follow me.

If they did, I fear the Bloodtotem may have captured them, or worse. In my current state, I can't muster the strength to find them. If you find them, it would be much appreciated.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Navarrogg's pets.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>These beasts are not terribly bright, but they are loyal in their way.</CompletionText>
