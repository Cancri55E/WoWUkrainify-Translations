  <Title>Unexpected Allies</Title>
  <Description>You have gained my trust. Not all drogbar are as violent as the savages led by Dargrul the Underking, nor are all tauren as bloodthirsty as the Bloodtotem.

You may tell Mayla Highmountain that she has our support. The cavern we call home is yours to explore freely as well, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Mayla Highmountain at Thunder Totem.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Torok is dead? By... your hand? He must have truly given in to his thirst for blood if that came to pass.

The Stonedark on our side, though... That is an advantage I had not expected. Navarrogg has always been much more agreeable than Dargrul and his brood. Thank you for striking this rare alliance, $n.</RewardText>
