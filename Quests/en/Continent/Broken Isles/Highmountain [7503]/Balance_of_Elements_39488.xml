  <Description>The drogbar place their foul crystals in our cave to absorb the magic within, and then they collect them when they are saturated with power.

We must recover the crystals so the magic might dissipate and be suffused back into the waters, or else the drogbar will find ways to corrupt the magic to their own purposes.</Description>
