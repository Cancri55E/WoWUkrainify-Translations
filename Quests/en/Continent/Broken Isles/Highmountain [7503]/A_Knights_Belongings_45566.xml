  <Title>A Knight's Belongings</Title>
  <Description>Amidst the squalls and the crashing waves, my mighty ship swayed and tumbled. Lesser knights would have trembled in terror, frozen stiff. Not me! Nay! Heroically, I stripped my armor off my back and stored it safely in my sack. 

Why did I strip down to these simple undergarments, you ask? Only an ignorant squire would. I was wary of sinking to the bottom should my ship fall foul of course! Ha ha! 

Unfortunately, the sacks of armor were thrown overboard by the waves.</Description>
