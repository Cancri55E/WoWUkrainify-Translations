  <Title>An Audience with Torok</Title>
  <Description>I should warn you that Torok is easily displeased and is hateful of outsiders. Be on your guard.

We will seek an audience with him at his tent at the Cliff's Edge. As the Rivermane Emissary here, I am afforded some protection against aggression, but they have made no such promises about you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Torok Bloodtotem.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I just hope the Bloodtotem don't cut us down for demanding their chieftain's time.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Strange that he would be in the cavern at this time... perhaps this is a good sign?</RewardText>
