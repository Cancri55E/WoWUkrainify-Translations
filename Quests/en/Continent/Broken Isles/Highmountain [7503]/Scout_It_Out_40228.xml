  <Title>Scout It Out</Title>
  <Description>You've proven that a gnome can shoot a rifle, and that's no easy feat, but a true test of Addie's skill will be to see if she can track down an elusive beast.

Rumor has it that a ravenous roc circles the basin, cursed by harpy magic, but no one's seen the beast up close.

Take this flare, and shoot it into the sky once you've spotted the roc. When we see the signal, the huntin' party will rush in and help bring down that magnificent bird!</Description>

  <CompletionText>Don't just stand there, head out into the basin and find that bird!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That was a kill I won't soon forget!$b$bAddie will write the tale of our adventures here today, but not many will believe that a gnome hunter took down a beast ten times her size.</RewardText>
