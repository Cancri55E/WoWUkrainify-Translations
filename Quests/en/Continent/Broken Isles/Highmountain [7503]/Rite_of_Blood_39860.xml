  <Title>Rite of Blood</Title>
  <Description>Oakin Ironbull vouches for you. He's capable, for a Rivermane. You also brought with you proof of your own strength, albeit rather inconclusive proof.

Before we allow you to move freely within our territory, you must complete the Rite of Blood, which you have already begun. If you succeed--and I doubt you will--talk to me.

Enter the depths of the cave. Defeat whatever foe appears and return to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Complete the Rite of Blood.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you for saving me. I hope now we can trust each other. We must if we are to defeat these Feltotem.</RewardText>
