  <Description>The journey here was perilous, Squire. It was fraught with danger. Storms, demons, storm demons... I shudder at the memory. Of course, I overcame all such dangers at great loss to my person. This is where I need your assistance.

You must venture forth--nay, sally forth--and recover my armor, my weapon, and of course my grand steed. Once you have successfully completed these tasks three, will you be promoted to Squire, First Class!</Description>
