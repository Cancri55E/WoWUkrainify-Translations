  <Title>A True Hunter</Title>
  <Description>I don't know why Hemet hunts with Razik. His contraptions are unreliable at best! 

A true hunter doesn't need gadgets to hunt. They rely on instinct, skill, and agility.

So tell me, $n, do you have the skills of a true hunter? Better yet, prove it.

Take down some of the Bonebeak Hawks that circle the nearby meadow.</Description>
