  <Title>Hags of a Feather</Title>
  <Description>The drogbar you freed me from were unusually aggressive. The tribe in the nearby caves seems to be apart from the rest of them, but that didn't stop the Bloodtotem from going on the offensive just in case, capturing some of their number.

That move left the woods exposed to the harpies, however. Your help dealing with these witches would not go unnoticed by Torok. Bring back their feathers as proof of death.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Hag Feathers from Witchwood Hags in the Witchwood.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Your size belies your strength, $n.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I could hear them screeching from here. With this victory and the defeat of the Witch of the Wood, Torok will surely be willing to see you.</RewardText>
