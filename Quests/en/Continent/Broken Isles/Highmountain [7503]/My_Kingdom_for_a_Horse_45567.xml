  <Description>Oh, woe is me! Soon after making landfall I began exploring, riding my trusty steed Pimento into the heart of a demon infested village to the north. While performing my investigations, I tied Pimento up to go further on foot, only to return and discover a powerful demon had captured her! There he was, riding her like she was his own. Please find her and send her back to me.</Description>
