  <Title>I'm Not Lion!</Title>
  <Description>I've hunted many exotic beasts in my day, but I've never seen a lion like the one I encountered while scouting the basin.

The beast's amber eyes locked on mine, luring me closer. I was helpless to this predator's enchanting gaze. It was only when the lion pounced did the stupor break.

I've told Hemet of this magical beast, but he laughs. I'm not lying, $n! The lion exists.

If you find the beast, bring me a trophy of your kill, and I'll reward you handsomely.</Description>
