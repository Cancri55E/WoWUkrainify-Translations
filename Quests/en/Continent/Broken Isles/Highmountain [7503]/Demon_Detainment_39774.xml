  <Title>Demon Detainment</Title>
  <Description>The demons that escaped must be detained. Killing them is not an option. Uriah was entrusted to deliver the prisoners to Allari for interrogation, and I will not let him fail.

I've seen Uriah trap many demons. It seems... complicated, but I think I can pull it off. I'll just need you to subdue them first.</Description>
