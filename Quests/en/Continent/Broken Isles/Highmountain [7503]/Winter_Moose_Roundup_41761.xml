  <Title>Winter Moose Roundup</Title>
  <Description>My father, Karmaan, owns this farm, and our main livestock are talbuk. One of the podlings must have opened the gate to their pen and they all escaped!$B$BThe little terrors could have slaughtered them in the cage, but they like to hunt their prey. I'm afraid that if I stay out here much longer, I'll be their next meal!$B$BWill you round up the talbuk and bring them here? I can't get them myself, and I can't let my dad find out about this!</Description>
