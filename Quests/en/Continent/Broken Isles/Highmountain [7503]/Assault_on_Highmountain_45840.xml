  <Title>Assault on Highmountain</Title>
  <Description>In my years I have seen disturbances and threats come and go, but never before have I seen such brazen disregard for life. 

The demons may scorch our lands and cause suffering amongst our kin, but we must not stand idly by while they threaten what we have fought so hard to create.

Rise to the occasion, $n. The time has come to stand against the Burning Legion!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Repel the Burning Legion forces throughout Highmountain.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>My apologies, $n. I hope Aviash and I did not offend you. One cannot be too careful during times like these.</RewardText>
