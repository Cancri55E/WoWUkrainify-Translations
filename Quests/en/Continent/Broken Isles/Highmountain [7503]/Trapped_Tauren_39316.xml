  <Title>Trapped Tauren</Title>
  <Description>The drogbar just rounded up those of us that they could and led them to a cave near here.

If you act quickly, I think they can still be saved. I know not what purpose they have for capturing our people.

I shudder to think of it... in the deep places, the darkness rules.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Free the captured Rivermane tauren.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>They slew many of my brothers and sisters, but at least some managed to escape. Others, however, we captured.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>They have returned relatively unharmed. Thank you, $n.</RewardText>
