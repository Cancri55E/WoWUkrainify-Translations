  <Title>I'll Huff, I'll Puff...</Title>
  <Description>Murky is my favorite little fella. However, in order to lead a change in the murloc population here, he needs some awesome abilities.

There are a lot of pufferfish around in the water, and I think that they could be a good resource for him. 

Kill a few and collect their eggs for Murky.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Pufferfish Eggs.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Pufferfish have this impressive ability of... exploding. They could be a powerful tool for Murky.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The pufferfish will be a perfect resource for Murky! I'll just whip up a spell to make them grow more quickly.

All he'll have to do is throw, then boom!</RewardText>
