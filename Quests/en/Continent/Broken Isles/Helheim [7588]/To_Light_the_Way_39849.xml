  <Title>To Light the Way</Title>
  <Description>Helya must think her challenge unwinnable. We will show her different.

I am unsure what she did, but Helya has weakened you somehow. I have seen similar effects on my shieldmaidens, and now they are trapped by Helya's minions.

I may know a way, however. The Kvaldir ships carry special lanterns bound to this place to navigate through the fog. It is said that the light of these lanterns can release bonds of the spirit.

There is a kvaldir ship nearby. See if you can find one there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect a Helheim Waylight from Bloodbeard in Helheim.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to secure the lantern?</CompletionText>
