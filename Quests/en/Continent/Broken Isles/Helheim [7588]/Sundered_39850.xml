  <Description>I imagine the power of your weapon will be what allows us to defeat Geir, but right now you are too weak for the confrontation. We must reclaim the missing pieces of your spirit.

Helya must have scattered them throughout her realm to keep them from you. If you can find them, shine the lantern and they should be set free.

Be careful, though. It is unlikely that Helya left your spirit fragments unguarded.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find and release the Fragment of Will, Fragment of Might, and Fragment of Valor in Helheim.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you recovered your power?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Yes, I can feel your power returned. $B$BHelya will regret the day she challenged one such as you.</RewardText>
