  <Title>Allies in Death</Title>
  <Description>Our power alone may not be enough to fight the behemoth, Geir. Fortunately, Faljar was kind enough to send our allies into Helheim with us.

Earlier, I had discovered several of them being tortured by the elemental forces of Helheim. You may think the dead can't drown, but with Helya's power, this is not the case. 

I could not release them then, but now that you possess the waylight, you may be able to.

Seek them out and free them from an eternity of suffering!</Description>
