  <Description>We've reviewed the tome recovered from Karazhan. Though we found references to the Pillars of Creation, one piece of crucial information was omitted from the book... where to find the artifacts.$b$bFortunately, we have access to an expert on the subject.$b$bThe author, Alodi, was the first Guardian of Tirisfal. His spirit is forever bound to the Forge of the Guardian, which has been hidden in our safekeeping. I think the time has come to call him forth.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Tell Khadgar to begin the ritual to summon the spirit of Alodi, the first Guardian.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We may not have the exact location of the Pillars of Creation, but at least we know where to start. We'll explore every corner of the Broken Isles until they're recovered.$b$bThe Legion's attack is intensifying. We must prepare to move Dalaran to the Broken Isles!</RewardText>
