  <Title>Anomalous Anomalies</Title>
  <Description>Dalaran's move to this location was intended to be a temporary measure, but we may need to depart sooner than expected.$b$bBlinking a city across the world is no mean feat. The magnitude of energies involved can lead to... unexpected side effects.$b$bArcane anomalies are causing mischief throughout the city. Their presence could destabilize any attempt to blink again.$b$bWe don't have time to let them dissipate on their own, $n. I have a device that will help speed things along.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Khadgar's crystal to neutralize anomalies in Dalaran.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Good work. There are still some stray anomalies floating about, but you've negated enough interference that we should no longer be prevented from relocating the city.$b$bNow we just need to determine our destination.</RewardText>
