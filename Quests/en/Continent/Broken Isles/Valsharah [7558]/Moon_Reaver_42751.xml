  <LogDescription>Defeat Boneflux and rescue Keeper Remulos in The Undergorge.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>My wounds are great, and my magic has been severely drained. I must recover from this enervation and return to the Dreamgrove.

The owlkin here are beyond saving by mortal hands, but perhaps Elune will one day shine her light upon them again.

Thank you, $n. May your path be blessed.</RewardText>
