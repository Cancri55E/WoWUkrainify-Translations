  <Title>Dreamcatcher</Title>
  <Description>I cannot hold on for much longer...

I brought a dreamcatcher with me. I was to use it to steal the magic from owlbeast totems.

It is the only way to break the barrier where they hold Keeper Remulos.

Please help where I have failed.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Charge the dreamcatcher using owlbeast totems in Lostlight Grotto.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I knew Leirana... she was one of Remulos' favored, and kindhearted soul. If he has been captured as she believes, we have no time to mourn her passing.</RewardText>
