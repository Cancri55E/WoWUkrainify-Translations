  <Title>Battle for Val'sharah</Title>
  <Description>From the very start of these attacks I've felt as though the demons knew our plans, as if they anticipated our every move. If we are to put an end to this we must focus our attacks at the heart of the beast.

Your efforts have shown these battles are not won by bravery alone, but willingness and sacrifice. I ask that you stand on the battlefield once more among allies to bring this madness to an end.</Description>
