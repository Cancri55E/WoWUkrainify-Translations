  <Title>The Mail Must Flow</Title>
  <Description>Due to all of the recent shenanigans, I'm running short on mailementals to sort letters.

It's a simple job, really - just toss the letter into the proper portal, where it will be whisked away to the far corners of Azeroth and beyond.

I like to make a little game out of it. How many can you sort in one minute?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help the Postmaster sort at least 15 letters within the time limit.</LogDescription>
