  <Title>Bringer of the Light</Title>
  <Description>Turalyon lives! For ages I had thought that my old friend had perished on some desolate Legion world. But to know that he yet lives and is in danger is too much to bear.$B$BWe must hurry, $n. We must uncover the object's sacred purpose.$B$BThe prophet of whom Turalyon spoke of is undoubtedly the leader of the draenei, Velen. Take the object and journey to the Exodar. It is there that you will find Prophet Velen.$B$BI will open a portal for you now. Take my beacon and use it when you are ready to return.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Discover the purpose of the Mysterious Lightbound Object.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Kil'jaeden took the child from Velen, let Velen believe that the boy had been killed, then raised the child as an agent of the Burning Legion with the express purpose of murdering his own father? That bastard waited 13,000 years to exact vengeance upon Velen for defying Sargeras and the Legion? The Deceiver indeed...$B$BFor Velen to have to experience such tragedy after what he and his people have already been through is heartbreaking. Such a thing would test anyone's faith.</RewardText>
