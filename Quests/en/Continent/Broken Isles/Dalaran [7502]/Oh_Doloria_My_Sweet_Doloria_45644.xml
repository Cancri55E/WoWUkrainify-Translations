  <Title>Oh Doloria, My Sweet Doloria</Title>
  <Description>What ho! We are quite the dashing pair of adventurers, aren't we?

Now that we have secured my belongings, a new path unfolds before us. I did not journey here simply to thwart the demon invasion, no! I came here in search of my beloved, my loved, Doloria. Whilst resting between slaying of dragons, I had a dream, nay, a vision. It told me Doloria had been kidnapped and taken to a floating city in the sky!

It must be Dalaran. Quickly, squire! Mount up and meet me at Dalaran's famous inn. Make haste!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Seek out Doloria in the Legerdermain Lounge in Dalaran.</LogDescription>
