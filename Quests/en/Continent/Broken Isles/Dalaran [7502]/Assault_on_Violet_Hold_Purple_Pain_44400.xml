  <Title>Assault on Violet Hold: Purple Pain</Title>
  <Description>Again! It happened again!

Sure, it's the Legion that staged the prison breakout this time, but I *told* them it was a bad idea to keep some of the most dangerous beings on Azeroth in a prison inside our city!

We can talk about relocating later, I suppose. Right now, we've got some... pacification to tend to.

Can you help?</Description>
