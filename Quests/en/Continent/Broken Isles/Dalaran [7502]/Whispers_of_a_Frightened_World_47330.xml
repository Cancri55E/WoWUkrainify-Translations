  <Title>Whispers of a Frightened World</Title>
  <Description>Champion, Magni needs your help!$b$bThe Speaker has a message for you, perhaps from Azeroth herself.

  <LogDescription>Meet Magni in Sholazar Basin and hear the warning.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Yes, $n? What news do you bring?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This warning is an ill omen indeed, $n. It seems the fate of Azeroth is tied to that of Argus, the homeworld of the Legion.$b$bWe must uncover the Dark Titan's plan! I believe the Speaker's connection to the world soul will prove crucial to our efforts.$b$bStay vigilant, $ct. We must trust in Magni's guidance... and Azeroth's as well.</RewardText>
