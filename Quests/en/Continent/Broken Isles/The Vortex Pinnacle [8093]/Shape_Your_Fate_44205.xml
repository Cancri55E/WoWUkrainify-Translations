  <Title>Shape Your Fate</Title>
  <Description>The whims of the spirits can be guided, I have seen it.

There were whispers of an item, a way to change the path of destiny.  I heard dem, and I went looking.  For many years I listened to those whispers on the wind until one day they showed me the way.  This is what I offer you.  It will take some time, and some valuable resources, but I can perform the ritual to allow you to control this power.

Well?  Are you ready?</Description>
