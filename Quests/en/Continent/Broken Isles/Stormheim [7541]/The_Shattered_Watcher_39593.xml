  <Title>The Shattered Watcher</Title>
  <Description>When your adversary - the one called Skovald- completed his first trial, he used his ill-begotten powers to sunder my physical body.

His forces have no doubt scattered my pieces through the plateau which they currently desecrate. Bring them back to me, so that I may properly guide your trial.</Description>
