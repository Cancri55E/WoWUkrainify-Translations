  <Title>To Weather the Storm</Title>
  <Description>When I was scouting this place out, I noticed the vrykul here are no strangers to the treacherous mountain path we're trying to get to. They've got some specialized equipment they're using, and if I were you I'd try to get my hands on some.

You'll want to find some climbing treads to keep your grip and an oiled cloak to keep you dry. They've also got these stones they carry to keep the lightning at bay, so you'll want to pick one of those up as well.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect Climbing Treads, an Oiled Cloak, and an Enchanted Lodestone from Hrydshal.</LogDescription>
