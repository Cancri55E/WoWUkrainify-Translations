  <Title>Time to Collect</Title>
  <Description>Hey there, pal. My sources around here say you had a run-in with the Sixtrigger brothers. I'd imagine you're not very happy with them?

Let's just say we're not exactly friends either.

So I'll tell you what. How about I let you in on some intel about their current location? Maybe they might have an unfortunate accident, you follow?

Oh, and bring some friends. They're not exactly the easiest of targets.</Description>
