"byproducts" onboard.$B$BRegrettably, one such substance was released during our skirmish with the Alliance gunship. As you can see, it is taking quite a toll on the coast.$B$BThe R.A.S. must remedy this situation before we press further inland.$B$BPlease take a containment unit and fill it with waste - for us to dispose of properly at a later time, of course.</Description>
