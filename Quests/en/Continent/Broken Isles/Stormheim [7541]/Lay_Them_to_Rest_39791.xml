  <Title>Lay Them to Rest</Title>
  <Description>I would ask a favor, outsider.

As you step through the graves of ancient heroes, you will no doubt come across spirits of the restless dead, agitated by the Bonespeakers misdeeds. They must be returned to the earth where they are buried, so that they may be judged as well.

Take this bough - it carries with it the essence of the Runewood. Channel its power into a weakened spirit, and it will return to rest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Branch of the Runewood to send 8 weakened Restless Ancestors back to the earth.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I see you carry a branch of the Runewood. Then it was you who laid the spirits to rest? $B$BThough I do not know your purpose, outsider, I appreciate what you have done for our people.</RewardText>
