  <Title>Leying with Murlocs</Title>
  <Description>I have seen these Seerspine summon minor elementals, which is no small feat for a murloc, but their high summoner, Blargrrrl, is trying to summon Torretus from the river.$B$BI doubt a mere murloc has the capabilities to control an entity as powerful as Torrentus.$B$BBlargrrrl will be deeply entranced if he is trying such a feat. We'll need something powerful to halt his ritual.$B$BInfuse yourself with ley energies and return to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Infuse yourself with ley energies located in the Murloc Shoals.</LogDescription>
