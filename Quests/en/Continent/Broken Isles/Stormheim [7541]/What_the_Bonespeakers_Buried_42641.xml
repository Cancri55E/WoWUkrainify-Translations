  <Title>What the Bonespeakers Buried</Title>
  <Description>Most Fascinating! It would appear that we're dealing with our very own vrykul vampyr!

All we have encountered have been of blood elven descent, but it has long been theorized that the vrykul have suffered the curse as well. It's too bad he's awake - I would dearly like a subject to study.

Oh well, guess there's nothing for it. Take this stake and put it through the old chap's heart. I'm pretty sure that should do the trick.</Description>

  <RewardText>Oh, the stake didn't work you say?  My apologies, I must've had my immortal evil undead mixed up.$B$BYou're all in one piece though, and the evil has seen its end. Hopefully, at least.$B$BVampyr can die, can't they?</RewardText>
