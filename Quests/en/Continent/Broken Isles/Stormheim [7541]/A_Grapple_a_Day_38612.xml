  <Title>A Grapple a Day</Title>
  <Description>So some old magic vrykul is helping us out? I guess that's good, but this trial of yours might be tricky. You see, the only way up that mountain, is through those big walls.

You know, the ones with the mean-looking drakes on them.

I scouted a bit, but couldn't get too far without those drakes trying to make lunch out of poor Duchess. The vrykul have them trained, which can't be good.

I say we sneak in. I managed to snag a few grapple launchers earlier. Grab one and meet me outside the city walls.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Pick up a Stormforged Grapple Launcher and meet Dread-Rider Cullen outside the wall of Hrydshal.</LogDescription>
