  <Title>A Grapple a Day</Title>
  <Description>So these trials are what will get us the Aegis, and the next one is on the top of that mountain? That may prove problematic.

The only way I see up the mountain is through that vrykul city, and the gates are shut tight. We should be able to grapple over, though. If you don't have a launcher, I managed to wrangle a spare from one of these vrykul.

I'll scout ahead and see if I can find a good spot to get in.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Pick up a Stormforged Grapple Launcher and meet Lorna Crowley outside the wall of Hrydshal.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That looks like it'll do the job nicely. $B$BLet's get in there before we're spotted.</RewardText>
