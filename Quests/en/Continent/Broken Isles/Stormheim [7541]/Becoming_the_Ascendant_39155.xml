  <Title>Becoming the Ascendant</Title>
  <Description>It would seem that the engravings depict a rite of ascension, which allows the shieldmaidens to enter the vault. I believe we can use this to our advantage.

You must become the next ascendant.

Go to the temple and perform the rites. Should you need to wade through the corpses of the shieldmaidens to do so, then so be it. 

Find me when you have completed this task, and we will take the vault for the Horde!</Description>
