  <Title>Ahead of the Game</Title>
  <Description>The watcher Yotnar keeps the vault, and he is a fickle one. Challengers come from far and wide seeking the trials, but the watcher chooses not to see.

If you wish to catch his eye, show him you are worth being seen.

Some of these challengers await in camps throughout the Valley of the Sword. Bring their heads to Yotnar, so that he may see them, and you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect the heads of the Gutspill, Rumblehoof, and Felskorn champions in Valley of the Sword.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>An ironic gift you bring me, challenger.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It is a shame to see the first worthy challenger for the Aegis treating the trials with such disrespect. Such hubris cannot win the Aegis, for the gods will surely strike him down for his arrogance.

You, however, seem different. You have shown that you are a worthy challenger. $B$BI will allow you to begin the trials.</RewardText>
