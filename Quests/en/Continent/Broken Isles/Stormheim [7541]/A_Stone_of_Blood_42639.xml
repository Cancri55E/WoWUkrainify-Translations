  <Title>A Stone of Blood</Title>
  <Description>Unfortunately, we may have another problem. That mist seeping out of the ruins has affected the looting pirates. It's driven them quite mad.

Only one of them seems to be unaffected - a captainly fellow with a very fine hat.  He wears a large ruby amulet, which I believe protects him from the mist. You'll need it if you are to enter the tomb.

He may not give it up willingly.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect Broketooth's Ruby Amulet from Captain Broketooth on the ships near Dreyrgrot.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We will need the amulet's protection to proceed.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You have the amulet! Most excellent!$B$BOf course, that probably won't help you with the pirates that are already mad as hatters, but small victories, eh chap?</RewardText>
