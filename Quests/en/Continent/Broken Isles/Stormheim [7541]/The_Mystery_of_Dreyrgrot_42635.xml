  <Title>The Mystery of Dreyrgrot</Title>
  <Description>Well met, good chap!

I was on my way to study the local murlocs when I stumbled upon these most peculiar ruins. Those pirates over yonder arrived first, and it appears they've unleashed some ancient evil.

I would be remiss to let such an evil run rampant, but we should learn more of it before we proceed, lest we end up like those chaps.

I spied the crew bringing back some tablets from the ruins. If you can bring them to me, I may be able to decipher the nature of this evil.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 4 Ancient Dreyrgrot tablets from the pirate ships outside of Dreyrgrot.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How goes the hunt for knowledge?</CompletionText>
