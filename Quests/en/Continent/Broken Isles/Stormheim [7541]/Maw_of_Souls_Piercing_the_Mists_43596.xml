  <Title>Maw of Souls: Piercing the Mists</Title>
  <Description>In a time before memory, the Naglfar was the prize of Helya's fleet. It would seem that it has lived on to serve her once more.

Now, the dread ship sails the sea of souls, and cuts through the mist unseen by the living. The kvaldir must have a way to summon her, and this is what you must seek.

Find her berth and board the Naglfar. Put an end to the dread ship, and the souls of the Tideskorn may be redeemed.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat Helya in the Maw of Souls dungeon, then return to Havi in Valdisdall</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is it done?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>With the dread ship sundered, the souls of the dead will know their judgement. $B$BOdyn will have his champions, and the Tideskorn will have their honor.</RewardText>
