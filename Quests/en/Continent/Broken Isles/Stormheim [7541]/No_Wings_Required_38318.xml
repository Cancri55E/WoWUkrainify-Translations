  <Description>Now that you've got the launcher, we should be able to infiltrate the city. It looks like there's a good spot to grapple onto on the wall just past us. There's a vantage point on top of this ridge.

Once we're in, I'll try to slip past the guards and get a look at the mountain path. I'd appreciate if you could make some distractions for me. If all goes well, I'll meet up with you in the upper city.

Good luck!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Go to the top of the ridge and use the Stormforged Grapple Launcher to launch over the wall at Hrydshal.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You should've seen the look on those vrykuls' faces when you came sailing over their wall! $B$BI could see that launcher coming in handy in a lot of places. You'd best hold on to it.</RewardText>
