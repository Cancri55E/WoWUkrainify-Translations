  <Title>Ending the New Beginning</Title>
  <Description>The Banshee Queen is here! I'd recognize those tainted arrows anywhere.

This is the moment we have been fighting for. Sylvanas will answer for her crimes against Varian Wrynn and the Alliance!

To arms!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Confront Sylvanas in the Vault of Eyir.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You're awake! We nearly lost you there... $B$BIt's a good thing we managed to get you and Greymane out of there in time, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to reverse Sylvanas's poison. It's a shame she got away, but her plans in Skold-Ashil failed and we have you to thank for it. $B$BI'm sure Greymane will order a commendation for you once he is fully recovered. You did a great thing here, $n. $B$BGilneas is in your debt.</RewardText>
