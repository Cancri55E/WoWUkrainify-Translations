  <Title>A Stone Cold Gamble</Title>
  <Description>The second target is a basilisk called Stonefang that lives off the bank of the nearby river. 

I put a bigger wager on him, so if you can take him out I'll make sure you get a cut.

I'll need his jaw to verify the kill. Hurry, before those tauren get him first!</Description>
