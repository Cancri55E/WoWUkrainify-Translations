  <Description>I've got bad news. Those harpoon launchers up on the walls might cause us some problems. 

They can't get at us down here, but once you start climbing that path, they're likely going to try to skewer you.

If you use that grapple launcher, you should be able to get on top of the walls and dismantle them. Watch out for the drakes, though!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Grapple on top of the walls in Hrydshal and dismantle 7 Tideskorn Harpoon Launchers.</LogDescription>
