  <Title>Only the Finest</Title>
  <Description>Say, you're a pretty good hunter, eh? Maybe you could help these tauren out by stocking them with some rare furs. I'm sure they'd appreciate it when they got back!

I hear that Stormheim goat hair can be woven into all kinds of things. The rarest are from the silver-tail goats. I think I saw some in that mountain over there.

Why don't you go and fetch some? I'm sure them tauren would pay you handsomely!</Description>
