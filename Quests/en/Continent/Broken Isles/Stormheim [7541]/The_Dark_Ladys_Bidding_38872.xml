  <Title>The Dark Lady's Bidding</Title>
  <Description>Uh, are these guys friendlies? I guess it's a good sign they haven't tried to eat Duchess... yet.

Anyway, I have orders. Nathanos caught up with the dark rangers, who were sent forward aboard the Oblivion on a secret mission from Lady Sylvanas herself! Unfortunately the Alliance caught wind of our plan, and now Greymane is attacking the outpost!

We could really use you over there, $n. Duchess can take you there, just give me the word.</Description>
