  <Title>Vengeance Point</Title>
  <Description>On my way here, I ran across a squad of demon hunters headed northwest to Vengeance Point. You can bet the Legion will try to stop them from establishing a forward position.

I spoke to an elf named Izal Whitemoon. Not the friendliest sort, but I'm sure she'd be grateful if you lent the Illidari a hand... whether she admits it or not.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat the Legion siege on Vengeance Point and report to Izal Whitemoon.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The Illidari don't waste time on congratulations. There is more to do, and you're the one to do it.$B$BGet a move on.</RewardText>
