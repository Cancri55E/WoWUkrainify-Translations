  <Description>Pst... Come 'ere! I just got a tip about a cave on this island that is a treasure trove of loot! This could be my biggest score yet.

Problem is, I uhh... sprained my ankle. Yeah, I would be right there with you battling those demons to get this treasure, but I shouldn't be putting any weight on this leg of mine. Shucks.

How about you go check on this cave and report back to me. I'll mark your map where the cave entrance is. I've been told it's pretty hidden, so you've got to look around.</Description>
