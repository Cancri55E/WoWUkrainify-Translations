  <Title>Grave Robbin'</Title>
  <Description>I am not a grave robber, but is it technically grave robbing if the treasure is sitting on a field of bones? It's not like it's buried or nothin'. I'm just gonna sit this one out, just in case.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Look for the rumored treasure in the Soul Ruins.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I'm always lookin' for more treasure!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You found a key in a chest? Nothing else?$B$BI'm guessing the last guy took all the goods, then accidentally locked the key in the chest. So, you just found a key to a chest that you've already looted. Fantastic work... And people say I suck at this job.</RewardText>
