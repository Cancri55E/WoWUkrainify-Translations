  <Title>Aalgen Point</Title>
  <Description>You wanna hold territory on this chunder puddle of an island, right? Right. That means linkin' up with camps on the outskirts, mate. 

I know this bloke called Heidirk. Scrappy fella, loves to get into the thick of it. Headed out to the eastern coast with those drakes of his.

Have a look for him. Remind him he owes me a pint or two!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Heidirk the Scalekeeper at Aalgen Point.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Chambers sent you? He can down a tankard with the best of 'em, I'll give him that. But if he says I owe him anything, he's a liar!$b$bDon't you worry, my drakes and I will hold the point here. But more of this shore will need to be secured before your campaign can find victory.</RewardText>
