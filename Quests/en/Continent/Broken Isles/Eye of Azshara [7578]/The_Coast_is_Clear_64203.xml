  <Title>The Coast is Clear</Title>
  <Description>I was on the last leg of a supply run when we were shot down! They took the pets, but the supplies are scattered over this stretch of beach.

I don't know what they're planning, but I know we gotta get our supplies. You an' me, we ain't subtle.... But Speedy IV... He won't cause all them pirates to go into hiding. He can get the supplies while Stringfellowe surveils the area from the air.

Speedy's fond of you, so chat him up and let's try to recover the smoldering supplies before they all burn up.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather pet supplies along the shores of Eye of Azshara with Speedy IV.</LogDescription>
