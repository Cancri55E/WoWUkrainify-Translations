  <Title>Boss Whalebelly's in Charge</Title>
  <Description>Great, let's get started! If we're going to break everyone out of here, you need to pose as a pit fighter like the rest of us. They won't just let you run around anywhere you want in here.

First thing you need to do is present yourself to Boss Whalebelly. The giants may run this place, but as far as posing as one of us, Whalebelly's in charge.

He's speaking with his goons just to the south.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Boss Whalebelly.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Go on. Go talk to him.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That could have gone better. Sounds like you've already made an enemy.

Still, that'll work to our advantage. You versus Boss Whalebelly. The fight of the century... or at least, the day.

Now to set everything up.</RewardText>
