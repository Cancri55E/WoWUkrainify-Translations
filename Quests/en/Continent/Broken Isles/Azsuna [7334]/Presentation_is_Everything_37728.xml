  <Description>The eggs will provide the 'oomph' to my drink's character. But there's another element, and this must not be underestimated!

Presentation.

But then, you wouldn't be me.

The eyes of Gangamesh are what I need.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Collect the Six Eyes of Gangamesh.</LogDescription>
