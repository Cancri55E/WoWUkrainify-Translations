  <Title>No Time for Tryouts</Title>
  <Description>We don't have time for you to go through a lengthy set of tryouts. But, fighting in the arena is our best chance at getting you in good with the giants.

That kind-hearted giant over there that's losing against Bilgerudder is Sternfathom. If you were to defeat his hozen champion, you'd make yourself a spot on his team.

Looks like Ooker Dooker's taking a rest between bouts. Now's the time to deliver a good ol' monkey beatdown.</Description>
