  <Title>Journey to the Repose</Title>
  <Description>For now, the Illidari can hold the line against the Legion. We will return later to help them drive the Legion from the upper reaches of Faronaar. You and I must concentrate on the Pillars of Creation if the Tomb of Sargeras is to be resealed.

Your saving of Stellagosa is fortuitous. Surely if anyone knows where a Pillar of Creation is, it will be her grandfather, Senegos.

The Azurewing Repose is to the northeast. I will meet you there, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Archmage Khadgar at the Azurewing Repose.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>He is... he's dying! Senegos is possibly the oldest dragon alive. We cannot simply let him slip away.

There is something not quite right with the magic energy here, I can feel it.</RewardText>
