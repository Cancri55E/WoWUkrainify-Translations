  <Title>The Scythe of Souls</Title>
  <Description>Let's head to the other side of the stand. We will release the demon souls one by one and get the answers that we seek concerning Lord Illidan.

The Scythe of Souls will ensure that we do.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Work with Allari the Souleater to compel information from the demon souls.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I wouldn't take what Arev'naal said to heart. The inquisitor demons are masters of misinformation. You don't suspect betrayal within the ranks, do you?

&lt;The Souleater looks thoughtful and grim.&gt;

I fear we won't have all of our answers about Lord Illidan for a while.</RewardText>
