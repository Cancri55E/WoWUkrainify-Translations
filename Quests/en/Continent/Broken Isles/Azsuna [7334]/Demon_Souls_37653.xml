  <Description>I need to extract information about the Burning Legion from these foul creatures. But living, the demons are almost impossible to break.

However, like you, I wield a powerful artifact -- the Scythe of Souls.

Take one of my soul gems. If you place it next to a demon's corpse, it will rip the 'soul' out. Then, we will see if the scythe can get them to talk.</Description>
