  <Title>Into the Fray</Title>
  <Description>The Burning Legion has beaten us here, but so too have the Illidari. It looks like the demon hunters are holding their own, but just barely.

Come, let's put that weapon of yours to use. I'll figure out our next move while you crush the Legion.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with the lead demon hunter at Illidari Stand.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The two of you are a welcome sight. We pushed the demons out of these ruins, but they are stronger than any we have encountered before.

Your help is appreciated. If we do not crush this Legion invasion now, they will overrun Azsuna and then the rest of the Broken Isles.</RewardText>
