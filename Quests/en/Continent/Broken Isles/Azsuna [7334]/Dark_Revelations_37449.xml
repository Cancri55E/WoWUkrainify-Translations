  <Description>I'm not going to let Cordana Felsong get away with this. There is no way in hell I am going to let that warden witch turn my people.

As for Nightglaive... I will NOT suffer a traitor to live!

Are you with me, $n?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Nightglaive the Traitor.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Grim news indeed. We cannot afford the loss of even one demon hunter, but you and Kor'vas were right to put an end to Nightglaive.

More importantly, you have made a good friend in Stellagosa. The remnant of the Blue Dragonflight could prove to be a powerful ally.</RewardText>
