  <Title>From Within</Title>
  <Description>Our demon hunters, Kor'vas Bloodthorn and Cyana Nightglaive took a small force of the Illidari across to Faronaar. Their mission was to weaken the Legion from within.

I haven't heard from them in a while.

It would be best if you could find and lead them to success. Agreed?</Description>
