  <Title>Saving Stellagosa</Title>
  <Description>During the fighting, of all things, I saw a blue drake swoop in and attack the demons. I couldn't believe my eyes. I'd heard that the Blue Dragonflight had gone extinct.

The Legion managed to bring the drake down, but not until after she'd killed a score of them. She was magnificent. Last I saw, they were dragging her in the direction of the southern camp.

We should see if she's still alive. A dragon could prove a powerful ally.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain Lykill's Key and free Stellagosa.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>If there's a remnant of the Blue Dragonflight nearby, we should do whatever we can to ally ourselves with them.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Beautiful creatures... pure, one with the world. I didn't think that I could hate the Legion more.

Thank you, $n.</RewardText>
