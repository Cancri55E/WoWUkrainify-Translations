  <Title>Morale Booster</Title>
  <Description>Things may look good from where you're standing, but, we're losing. However, do not fret, my little $r friend. You can help.

Listen closely. Ooka Dooker, Ooker's sister, is back over yonder in the champions' cave making her world famous Fighter Chow. It'll do the trick and boost our team's morale.

All you have to do is to convince her to hand it over.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Get the Fighter Chow from Ooka Dooker</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Yes, this'll do nicely... oh no! The last of my pit fighters have been defeated.

It's just you and me now, little $r.</RewardText>
