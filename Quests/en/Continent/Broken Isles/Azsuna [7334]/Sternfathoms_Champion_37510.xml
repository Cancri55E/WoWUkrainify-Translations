  <Title>Sternfathom's Champion</Title>
  <Description>Since you defeated Ooker Dooker, there's a pit fighter spot open on Sternfathom's team. You should go establish yourself as his champion. That way, the giants won't think twice about why a stranger is suddenly coming and going as $g he:she; pleases.

Meanwhile, I'll start to sow some chaos so that we can strike at Prince Oceanus.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Report to Sternfathom as his new pitfighter.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Hello, what can I do for you, little $r?

Ahahaha... it's you!  I like how you came in and immediately confronted Whalebelly. That little tuskarr's got it coming.

I can tell you're going to win big for me in the arena.</RewardText>
