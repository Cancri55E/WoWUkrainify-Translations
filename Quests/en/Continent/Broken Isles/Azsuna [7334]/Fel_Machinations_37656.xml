  <Title>Fel Machinations</Title>
  <Description>My force wiped out the demons' forward base here. But, an imp mother and her brood took the rest of my demon hunters hostage, including Cyana Nightglaive.

We need to free the Illidari and destroy the Burning Legion.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Free $1oa Demon Hunters from Soul Harvesters.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I've always had my doubts about Cyana. Something was never quite right there. Looks like she cracked and joined the Legion.

Still, we are not going to let her, or this Cordana Felsong, get away with it.</RewardText>
