  <Title>Trolling Them</Title>
  <Description>My army is disciplined, and they will follow my order not to engage the Sin'dorei in combat unless I give the command.$b$bHowever, it is with some level of shame that I must admit both armies have been attempting to harass the other with pranks, littering our respective camps with insults.$b$bPlease, $p, we need someone both armies respect to collect these items before fighting breaks out.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Remove insulting items from the elven war camps.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $p. Hopefully, since our forces saw you performing this task they will come to their senses and stop this harassment.</RewardText>
