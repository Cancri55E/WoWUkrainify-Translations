  <Title>Overwhelming Distraction</Title>
  <Description>Do you see the Nightborne outside this room?

They hold us here, like mice in a cage. It is more convenient for them that we are pinned down while they search the Sanctum for my father's relics.

My companions and I can escape to higher ground with some help.

Take this crystal. While standing on a mana focusing rune, use it to overcharge a Conjurer.

Their summons will turn on them and create an opening.

Use it well, and we will meet you atop the stronghold when the way is clear.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Overcharge 3 Imperial Conjurers using the Inert Crystal. You must be standing on a Mana Focuser to use the crystal.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We were able to make it here safely, thanks to you.</RewardText>
