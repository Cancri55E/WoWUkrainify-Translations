  <Title>Oculeth Ex Machina</Title>
  <Description>I have a plan to feed Shal'Aran.$b$bNow that I am no longer starving for mana I have had time to study ley lines in new regions. I detected an eddy of mana in the ley lines of Azsuna. I have plenty of magic at my disposal, but we must visit the ley line in person in order to properly redirect the energy to Shal'Aran.$b$bOculeth has graciously offered to teleport us there, but I could use an assistant. Care to join me?</Description>
