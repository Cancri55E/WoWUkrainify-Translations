  <Title>Cloaked in Moonshade</Title>
  <Description>I do not know what Theryn found, but I know where he found it. 

Moonshade Sanctum, to the west. Beyond the Temple of Fal'adora. 

Whatever power altered Theryn's arcane essence... Whatever power allowed Kel'danath to create a spell to soothe the withered... Its source rests there. 

I know this as surely as if I had been there myself.</Description>
