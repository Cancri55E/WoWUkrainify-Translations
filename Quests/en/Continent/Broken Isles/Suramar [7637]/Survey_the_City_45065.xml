  <Title>Survey the City</Title>
  <Description>Never a dull moment! Well... perhaps this is not entirely true.

I'm afraid I must ask you once more to return to the city to gather information. But this is not just any information - this is information extraction!

I require specific coordinates to allow me to focus my teleportations with extreme accuracy. It will, unfortunately, take a bit of time to dig through the information once retrieved, but no matter. We have plenty else to do in the meantime.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Advanced Telemancy Beacon to survey the Terrace of Order in Suramar City.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Let's hope this is survey is our last. I grow quite tired watching you run around all day.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I will begin analyzing this data at once.$B$BFor now, let us turn our attention to more... &lt;Oculeth touches his fingertips together in succession.&gt;$B$B...interesting technological advances.</RewardText>
