  <Title>The Stuff of Dreams</Title>
  <Description>This arcan'dor is one of an ancient species. They were not bred, but created. In them the arcane and primitive druidic magics merged into something greater than both.

The arcane will soon devour it whole.

We can restore balance, but it will require wild magic. Magic trapped in another realm.

You must enter the Emerald Dreamway and bring back the essence of life itself.

Only then can the arcan'dor find stability and begin to thrive once more.</Description>
