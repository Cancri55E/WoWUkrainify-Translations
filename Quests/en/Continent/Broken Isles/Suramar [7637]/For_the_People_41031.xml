  <Description>We have a problem, friend.

Across the canal is a district not well known for affluence. Since the demons' arrival, it has been locked down. I have heard the cries of those who have been deprived of sustenance.

Take this wineskin. Find an Arcwine fountain and take your fill.

Find those who are suffering and offer them a drink. It is the best we can do in the present circumstances.

You must not be seen doing this, $n. It will end badly.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate an Arcwine Fountain to fill your Empty Arcwine Skin, then offer Arcwine to Mana-Starved Nightborne.</LogDescription>
