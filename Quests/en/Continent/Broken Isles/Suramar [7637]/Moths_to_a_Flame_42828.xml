  <Description>No doubt you have noticed our guests.

I have watched them for a time and seen how they are attracted to the tree. I do not know if they are harmful to our sapling, but we cannot take that chance.

Collect a handful of the insects and bring them to me. I will examine them and determine if they are to be left alone.</Description>
