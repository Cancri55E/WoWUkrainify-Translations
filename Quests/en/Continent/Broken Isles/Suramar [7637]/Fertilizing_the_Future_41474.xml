  <Title>Fertilizing the Future</Title>
  <Description>Like most herbivores, our antlered friends will eat anything green enough to chew. 

However I have noticed that they seek these patches of dark grass, given their preference. I believe we can begin to earn their favor if we aid the forest in producing more of this most nutritious of stag food.

I will provide you with the seeds- all you must do is locate suitable growing soil and plant them. Our magic will do the rest.</Description>
