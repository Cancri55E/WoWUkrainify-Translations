  <Title>Shift Change</Title>
  <Description>This is as good a chance as we are going to get to rescue Verene's daughter.

Here is how this is going to work. 

You are going to wait here for the guard to pass by on their way to their guard shift. Look for something to hide in.

&lt;Silgryn marks a spot on your map.&gt;

You will know the guard by their bright red armor.

Follow closely, but not so closely that you are seen. It may be necessary to kill the guard when you reach your destination.

The child's name is Korine. Good luck.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Hide in the basket and wait for the guard to appear. Follow the guard to their destination.</LogDescription>
