  <Title>Not Here, Not Now, Not Ever</Title>
  <Description>I cannot, will not, accept what is happening here. My body resists me, but I will stop this.

&lt;He looks at you.&gt; You will stop this.

Here is a root of the corrupted World Tree Shaladrassil. It has somehow found its way out of the ground to this untouched place and already the Darkfiend satyrs are hard at work corrupting Suramar.

Stop them. Kill the satyrs, take their horns, drive their points through the totems.

Only then can we have any hope of reversing this.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Satyr Horns to destroy 3 Darkfiend Totems.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I am relieved, though there remains more we must do.</RewardText>
