  <Title>The Delicate Art of Telemancy</Title>
  <Description>I hadn't the time to gather my instruments before fleeing the palace. I came here to salvage some equipment.

This old workshop is actually several rooms connected by teleporter pads.

Elisande's goons are already scouring the place looking for me, but from here I can alter the teleporter network and keep them moving in circles.

You go in. I'll monitor your position and ensure the teleporters work normally for you.

Find these two parts and bring them back!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect the Weathered Telemancy Beacon and Cracked Warpsleeve from Oculeth's Workshop.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Salvaging the equipment here is necessary if I am to develop a teleporter network for Thalyssra.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These are in rough shape, but they will suffice.</RewardText>
