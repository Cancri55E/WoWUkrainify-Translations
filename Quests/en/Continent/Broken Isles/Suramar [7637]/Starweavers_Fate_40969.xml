  <Title>Starweaver's Fate</Title>
  <Description>I will take these tomes to Thalrenus.

There is one thing that weighs heavily on my mind, and I would like for you to attend to it in my stead. 

My wife and life partner, Syrana Starweaver, resides in the Starweaver's Sanctum across the bridge. It fell shortly after the Nightborne entered the Stronghold. 

If she still lives she will need to know of our efforts. Her power is sorely needed. 

Give her my best- I will be along shortly.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate Syrana Starweaver</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Lothrius and Thalrenus live, then. There may be some hope yet. Thank you for braving the bridge, stranger.</RewardText>
