  <Title>Arcan'dor, Gift of the Ancient Magi</Title>
  <Description>Thousands of years ago, as the Quel'dorei were just beginning to unravel the mysteries of the arcane, a small enclave of druids met with the first of the elven magi.

In the pale moonlight, they formed an order that would seek to bring the arcane into balance - using nature itself as a vessel. Thus the arcan'dor were created.

My masters who belonged to this order have long since faded away. Yet their legacy remains.

Their gift will mend the spirit of the shal'dorei. Let them eat, and be made whole.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Pick the Fruit of the Arcan'dor and share it with Chief Telemancer Oculeth, Arcanist Valtrois, and First Arcanist Thalyssra.</LogDescription>
