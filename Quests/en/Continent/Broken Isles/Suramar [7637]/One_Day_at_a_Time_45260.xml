  <Description>Thank you for coming, outlander. It is good to see you again.

I have a situation in the city that needs your attention, but first... 

Let us talk of hope.

&lt;Thalyssra gestures toward the arcan'dor.&gt;

The fruit of the arcan'dor can truly free my people from the Nightwell. However, it only grows so fast. It will take time to distribute this cure.

I think it only right that you help me pass out the fruit as it is ready. Please take this, and give it to anyone.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a Suramar Refugee in Shal'Aran.</LogDescription>
