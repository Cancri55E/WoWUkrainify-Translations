  <Description>How could I let this happen?

&lt;Aurore wrings her hands.&gt;

Yesterday Coryn Stelleris approached me about the appointment. He sought my support, but I did not offer it. 

He said my son's life would continue as normal... if I gave him my vote.

This morning my son was gone.

I can only think of the terrible things he may be suffering. You know what this family is capable of!

You want my support, but I can do nothing while my son is in danger. Nothing.

Please... save him!</Description>
