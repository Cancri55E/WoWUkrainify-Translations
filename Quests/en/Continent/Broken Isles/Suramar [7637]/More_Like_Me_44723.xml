  <Title>More Like Me</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, Outlander.$b$bI am Victoire. I served Elisande while she maintained peace in the city. I fought beside demons and worse for the greater good.$b$bThe massacre at the Waning Crescent made it clear that she no longer serves the Nightborne. She serves only herself.$b$bThere are others who feel as I do. They simply need proof that there is another way.$b$bThe Dusk Lily is not unknown to us- try showing it to those now guarding Astravar Harbor. They have seen the worst of Elisande's cruelty.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Dusk Lily Sigil on Duskwatch Subjugators to identify 5 Deserters.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find more like me?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hopefully more will follow their example.$b$bThank you for showing them another way to serve the Nightborne.</RewardText>
