  <Title>A Message From Ly'leth</Title>
  <Description>The arcan'dor bears fruit once again. Just in time, too - Ly'leth has sent us a message, and it seems she may have a lead on Vanthir. He is long overdue for this gift, assuming we manage to find him.

Give a fruit to another citizen here in Shal'Aran while I finish decrypting Ly'leth's message.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Feed the Fruit of the Arcan'dor to a Suramar Refugee in Shal'Aran.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>There. I certainly hope Ly'leth has good news...</RewardText>
