  <Description>Given the events at the Waning Crescent, the refugees here are more eager than ever to receive the gift of the arcan'dor and be free of the Nightwell forever. 

Fortunately, the tree has borne more fruit. Again, I ask that you honor us by giving this fruit to anyone here in Shal'Aran.

When you are finished, we shall discuss further developments within the city. Silgryn reports that Arluelle has proven a fine student, and the two are making progress in evacuating citizens.</Description>
