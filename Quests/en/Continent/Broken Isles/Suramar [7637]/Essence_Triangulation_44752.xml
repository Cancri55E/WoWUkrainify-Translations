  <Title>Essence Triangulation</Title>
  <Description>Vanthir... an example! That certainly explains why Elisande chose to hold him this long.$b$bWe need to move quickly. I can track him, but I will need to find places where his Arcane Essence is strongest.$b$bThis will not be an easy feat, not in a city this old, but with any luck there are a few places important enough to him that he left a little bit of himself behind.$b$bWe should start in the promenade- he often visited it for business.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Thalyssra collect 3 of Vanthir's Arcane Essences.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>All that remains is to focus on his essence to isolate his location. Good work.</RewardText>
