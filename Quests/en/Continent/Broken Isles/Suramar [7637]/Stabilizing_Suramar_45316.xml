  <Title>Stabilizing Suramar</Title>
  <Description>Elisande's plan has backfired. She thought to stamp out our rebellion by making an example of the Waning Crescent. 

Instead, she ignited the flame of the shal'dorei better than I ever could.

We must maintain a cohesive campaign against Elisande and the Legion by fighting them in every corner of Suramar. 

Show the people that there is still hope - that there are still heroes willing to fight for them!</Description>
