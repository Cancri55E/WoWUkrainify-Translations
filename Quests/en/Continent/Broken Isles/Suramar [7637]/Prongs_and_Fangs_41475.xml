  <Title>Prongs and Fangs</Title>
  <Description>Now, $n, do not mistake me- I am a druid. I understand that nature has a balance.

Predators must feed, and others will be hunted. I also understand that tampering with such balance has consequences.

That is why I have taken upon myself to walk this land and perform some... ah... calculations.

Slay only a small number of the wolves you find, and one alpha. That should reduce their number enough to allow the Sablehorn to thrive without disrupting the flow of things here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 8 Suramar Snarlers and Gloomfang.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Are you being gentle with your pruning?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>In the end, they will all thrive- for with more Sablehorn, the wolves will eat better in the years to come.</RewardText>
