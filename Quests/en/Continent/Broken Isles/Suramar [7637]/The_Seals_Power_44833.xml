  <Title>The Seal's Power</Title>
  <Description>The Nightwell is so overloaded that they could not spare anything for this seal. Instead, they are borrowing power from the ley lines.

I have traced one of their power sources to Kel'balor. We should head there immediately so I can determine how best to disable this barrier.

Yes of course I said "we." Surely you do not expect me to go without my bodyguard, do you?

I shall meet you there!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Investigate the ley line device at Kel'balor in the Crimson Thicket.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Valtrois told me everything. She is hard at work on a plan for bringing down that barrier.$B$BI am afraid all we can do for now is wait. Thank you for your help.</RewardText>
