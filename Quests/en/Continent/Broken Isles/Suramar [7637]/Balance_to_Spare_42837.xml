  <Title>Balance to Spare</Title>
  <Description>Our tour is just about over. I will let you loose to 'walk the orchard', as is proper at this stage.

While you are there, you will notice a large number of mana wyrms floating about.

I am certain the vineyard would not miss a handful of them.

Good luck with your insect problem, friend.

&lt;Margaux smiles warmly at you.&gt;</Description>
