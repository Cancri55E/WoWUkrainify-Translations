  <Title>The Gondolier</Title>
  <Description>I need your help.

The wine you so graciously distributed to the needy was the last of my reserves. Without more, these people here will risk succumbing to their thirst, and eventually becoming withered.

I am dedicated to preventing this for as long as possible.

There is a woman by the name of Deline who owns and operates a small delivery service out of her gondola.

Find her, identify yourself as my messenger, and offer your aid in acquiring the next shipment.</Description>
