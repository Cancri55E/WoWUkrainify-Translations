  <Title>Hired Help</Title>
  <Description>I was fond of Margaux. News of her death weighs heavily on many of us.

&lt;Vanthir shakes his head sadly.&gt;

If we are to carry on, we need to send a strong message. We need those like Durant to know that we are watching, and we will hold them accountable.

I know someone who could help us.

His name is Arluin. To call him a reluctant ally would be generously overstating it. He is cautious, and will not risk himself without compensation.

You can find him in the alleys north of the Evermoon Bazaar.</Description>
