  <Description>It is time for you to enter the city proper, $n.

I am sending you to my loyal friend Vanthir. I do hope you remember him- I can guarantee that he remembers you.

I will not be able to accompany you, but I must stress that the disguise I have granted you is not impervious. Tread carefully, and avoid those who stare too long.

Farewell for now.</Description>
