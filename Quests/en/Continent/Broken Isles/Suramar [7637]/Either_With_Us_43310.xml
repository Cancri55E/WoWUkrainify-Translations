  <Title>Either With Us</Title>
  <Description>Thalyssra asks much of me, but our cause is worth the risks.

The title of advisor would grant us enormous influence. Information. Access.

I could change this rebellion. I could save so many lives.

I will need strong endorsement to ascend, though. There are many houses who stand with me by virtue of my family's name. Some are more hesitant.

Earn her trust and the rest will follow.</Description>
