  <Title>A "Noble" Event</Title>
  <Description>The invitation appears to be for an exclusive fox hunt. They plan to hunt Volpin, a rare, elusive fox somewhere in the Broken Isles.  Perhaps we can take advantage of this?

We need to gather more information about this hunt, but we should do so without alerting the Nightborne to your plans. Your champions can act in your stead and further  investigate where the hunt will be.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Send champions on missions to investigate the hunt.</LogDescription>
