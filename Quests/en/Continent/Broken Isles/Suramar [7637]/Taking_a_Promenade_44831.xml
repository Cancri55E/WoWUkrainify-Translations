  <Title>Taking a Promenade</Title>
  <Description>These people are foreign to us, despite our common heritage. They have changed much in the years they have been cloistered away.$b$bWe need to learn more about them, what they are capable of. We dispatched one of our scouts to infiltrate the Promenade and assess the defenses. The blood elves did the same, although I doubt their ability to be discreet.$b$bBoth are long past due for reporting back to us. Find them and make sure they are safe or at least did not die in vain.</Description>
