  <Title>Cling to Hope</Title>
  <Description>Your kindness has inspired me, friend.

I thought I would wander forever among the empty husks of the Withered, but Thalyssra invited me in.

I have chosen to remain here with my people and together we will take back Suramar.

For now I have but one request.

Take this letter to my wife. She should know that I still live, among other things.

Give her the hope that you gave me.</Description>
