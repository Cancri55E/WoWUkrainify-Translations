  <Title>All In</Title>
  <Description>It is time to put our plan into action.

Oculeth will send you, Arluin and myself into the Arcway, where we shall trigger a manastorm in the Nightflow Conduit.

Valtrois will stay here and prepare Shal'Aran for a massive jolt of arcane power - hopefully enough to satisfy the arcan'dor.

$p... We have a saying... "To lead is to stand alone." It means only those who bear the weight of leadership can truly appreciate it.

Thank you for standing beside me. In truth, I do not feel alone.</Description>
