  <Title>Trial by Demonfire</Title>
  <Description>We are out of time. I have reports that a pitlord has come to Meredil. 

I have dispatched a strike force. We cannot let this demon flank our army here, nor can we let him find Shal'Aran. It is time to temper these recruits in a real battle.

Join our forces in Meredil, engage the demon, and help us ensure this new army of ours is not lost in its first conflict.</Description>

  <RewardText>Well done. Sometimes a single victory is enough to bring an army together. With time, these recruits shall train others, and we can grow our army to many times this size.</RewardText>
