As we learned to subsist on the Nightwell, the old facilities fell out of use.$B$BThis chamber is clearly receiving power from elsewhere.$B$BThere is only a trickle now, but if you can direct more leyline energy here it will help to sustain us.$B$BThe closest source is to the north, near Anora Hollow.</Description>
