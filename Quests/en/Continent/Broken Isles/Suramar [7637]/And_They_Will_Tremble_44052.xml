  <Title>And They Will Tremble</Title>
  <Description>There will be consequences for what has transpired this day.

For now, you should return to Thalyssra. Tell her that we have avenged Margaux and that the Dusk Lily has announced itself to all of Suramar.

There will be many more deaths before this is over, rest assured, but this is a death that will teach others like Durant to tread more carefully in the future.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Thalyssra</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It is a relief, if a small one. You have done well - rest for now.</RewardText>
