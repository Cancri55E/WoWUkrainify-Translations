  <Title>Stop the Spell Seekers</Title>
  <Description>The Nightborne are here in force. As if that were not worrying enough, they now bring reinforcements.

I have seen them opening large portals to Suramar.

Through these portals they have called in their constructs. They are immune to much of my magic and so represent something of a stumbling block to rejoining the others.

Find the portals and close as many as you can. That should buy us some time.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Close 3 Spell Seeker Portals.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I can still sense them, $n.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Yes! I can feel their spells receding. Soon I will be able to rejoin Thalrenus!</RewardText>
