  <Title>Leyline Master</Title>
  <Description>You surprise me, outlander. During our first lesson about the ancient leylines, I half-expected you to be lost in daydreams of adventure, or treasure or... some such nonsense.

But you have proven an apt student.

Our leyline feed has grown extremely powerful. Watching it grow has taught me a great deal about the arcane, and the nature of mana.

I have one final lesson that will help you find even more ancient mana.</Description>
