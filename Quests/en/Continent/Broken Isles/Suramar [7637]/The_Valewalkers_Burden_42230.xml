  <Title>The Valewalker's Burden</Title>
  <Description>The seed is awakening. Without power it will quickly wither and die.

We must carry the seed out of here and plant it somewhere safe.

I am not strong enough to bear this burden. But you... you are brimming with power. I can sense it. 

Please take the seed.</Description>
