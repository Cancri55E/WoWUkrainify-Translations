  <Title>A Re-Warding Effort</Title>
  <Description>&lt;This small device of elegant nightborne design crackles gently with arcane power.

Kel'danath's notes mention wards that keep the withered at bay. It seems he found some form of spellcasting that does not tempt their ravenous appetite for magic.

These may prove useful in your search for the missing arcanist.&gt;</Description>

  <RewardText>&lt;The ward snaps to life, giving you a slight pinch. Kel'danath must have put great care into developing a spell that would scare the withered away without harming them.&gt;</RewardText>
