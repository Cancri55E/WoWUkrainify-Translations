  <Description>This is a rare treat, I hope you know. Not just anyone is allowed to stand on this hallowed ground.

&lt;Sylverin adjusts his cuffs in a dignified fashion.&gt;

To participate in the demonstration, simply take up an energy vessel and wade into the pool beside us. 

Catch the delicate dewdrops of Nightwell energy in the bowl as they fall- this is the only way one can safely manage its essence.

Once your vessel is full, proceed to our demonstration cask and gently pour the amalgamation into it.

Enjoy!</Description>
