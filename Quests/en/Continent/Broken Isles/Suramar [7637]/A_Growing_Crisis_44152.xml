  <Title>A Growing Crisis</Title>
  <Description>The Arcan'dor is failing.

This energy was once bound in its boughs and fueled its growth. There was balance, between life and arcane.

Now that energy is breaking free. When the heart can no longer hold it, this tree will kill every living thing in this hall.

I have seen this happen before and I must find a way to stop it from happening again. 

We must go to the tree that came before. Its bones can guide us.

Meet me at the temple of Fal'adora. We will descend together.</Description>
