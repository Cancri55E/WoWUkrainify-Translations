  <Title>Dispensing Compassion</Title>
  <Description>There is much you need to learn about our city.

First and foremost, Arcwine. It is the vehicle by which we imbibe the Nightwell's energies. Without it, we wither and die.

Palace lackeys have seen fit to ration it, thinking this will control us. Keep us quiet, complacent.

I would like you to look for those in need near the tavern. You will find many, but those most desperately afflicted by this rationing will be obvious.

Take this flask. Revive them. Tend to their suffering.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Offer Arcwine to suffering citizens.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you served those who suffer?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Your eyes are opening to our reality. I can see it in your expression. Good.</RewardText>
