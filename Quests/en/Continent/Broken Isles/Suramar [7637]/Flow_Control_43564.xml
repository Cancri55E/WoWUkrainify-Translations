  <Description>If all goes as planned, the manastorm will cause the leyline to flare up, sending a great surge of energy through the arcway.

In order for the surge to reach Shal'Aran, we must seal off any outlets along the way. If we miss even one, the mission fails - and hundreds of people will be vaporized by the energy blow off.

Thalyssra had better be sure about this tree.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Seal off the Arcway Outlets in Lunastre Lane, The Parade Grounds, and the Midnight Court.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>If my map of the arcways is accurate, that should be all of the outlets we need to worry about.</RewardText>
