  <Title>Arcane Communion</Title>
  <Description>All of Kel'danath's experiments to connect with the withered failed, and some even made them more dangerous.

Until he found Theryn.

His arcane essence - the very soul of the shal'dorei - had been touched by something special. But what? 

By weaving my arcane essence together with Theryn's, I can create an empathic bond. This communion will bare his soul to us all - or what's left of it. 

We need only to feed him mana, and lots of it, in order to begin.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Feed Theryn 300 Ancient Mana.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Feed Theryn as much as he will take.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good. Let us see what we can learn.</RewardText>
