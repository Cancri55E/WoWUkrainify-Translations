  <Title>Arluin's Request</Title>
  <Description>I never thought I would need to read this...

&lt;Vanthir hefts a scroll in his hand.&gt;

Arluin made... plans... in the event he fell. It is not much, but I would like to honor his last request.

&lt;Vanthir hands you the scroll.&gt;

Go to the location marked on this map. Take this Arcan'dor Fruit and give it to a woman named Arluelle. Arluin was very specific that all rewards for his work be directed to her.

I think he may have known what his sacrifice meant. I was wrong about him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate Arluelle and give her a piece of the Arcan'dor Fruit.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Where is Arluin?</CompletionText>
