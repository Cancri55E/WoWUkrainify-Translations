  <Title>Powering Down the Portal</Title>
  <Description>Destroying the crystals will stop them temporarily, but it will be meaningless if we do not deal with the person controlling the portal itself.$b$bI heard their overseer, Ingra, shouting orders for more power so that she could bring the stronger Legion lieutenants through the gate. We must stop her to truly seal the portal for good.</Description>
  <AreaDescription>Slay Overseer Ingra.</AreaDescription>
  <LogDescription>Slay Overseer Ingra.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Kill Ingra, shut down the portal. Clear?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>A portal that big will not be reopening any time soon. I would say that counts as weakening their defenses.</RewardText>
