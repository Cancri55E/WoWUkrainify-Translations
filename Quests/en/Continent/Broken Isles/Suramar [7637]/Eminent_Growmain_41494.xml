  <Description>You have done very well, $r. 

All that is left is to combine their blessings into the ritual bundle and imbue the Moonwell. Once that is done, Mayruna will add a little water from a purified Moonwell and this land will be protected so long as we inhabit it.

This is a momentous occasion, my friend. You bear witness to a sacred rite not often performed in the company of strangers.

I will let you do the honors- simply place the ritual bundle into the sacred waters and we will do the rest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Imbue the inert waters with the ritual bundle, then witness the well's creation.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You witness history, $r.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Your assistance made this all possible. Thank you.</RewardText>
