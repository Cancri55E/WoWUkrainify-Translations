  <Title>The Orchestrator of Our Demise</Title>
  <Description>Conjurer Thalerian must be stopped.

He immediately sought out my father's private study when he arrived and he has not yet emerged. I worry that he may have found a very dangerous item.

It is called the Astromancer's Keystone. It is used to manipulate the stronghold's defenses.

Such magic was meant to protect the Moon Guard- used for any other purpose and it becomes unspeakably destructive.

Retrieve the Keystone. Slay Conjurer Thalerian to get it, if you must.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Conjurer Thalerian and acquire the Astromancer's Keystone.</LogDescription>
