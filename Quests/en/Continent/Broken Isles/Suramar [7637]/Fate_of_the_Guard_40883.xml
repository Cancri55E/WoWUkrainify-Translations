  <Title>Fate of the Guard</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Thalrenus looks you over.&gt;

You are not one of them.

The Nightborne came to our gates hours after the shield over Suramar fell. We thought them friends, despite our long separation.

We were wrong.

They poured into our stronghold and began the slaughter. We were unprepared. Though we fought, we were beaten.

The keep is lost. Our leaders have perished and their corpses lay in the streets.

Find them, give them their final rites.

While you search, look for survivors. Help them if you can.</Description>
