  <Description>The first step to establishing a moonwell is to gain the blessings of the local wildlife. 

It is their good will that enables us to  peacefully coexist, and a moonwell thrives on such energies. Combined with Elune's light, a moonwell can purify its surroundings for years.

To begin, we must find creatures willing to give their blessing. We can start with these owl-cat creatures.

They ran while you cleaned, but I saw one lingering just before the bridge. 

See if you can find where it lives!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Chase the Lost Feathermane Kitten across the bridge and return it to its family.</LogDescription>
