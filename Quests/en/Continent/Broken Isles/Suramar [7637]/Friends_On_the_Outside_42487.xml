  <Description>You have done well for us here, but it is time for you to return to Thalyssra.

There is a teleporter pad nearby that has gone unused in recent years. See if you can reroute it and return to her that way.

Oh, and before you go:

&lt;Vanthir hands you a wrapped bottle of Arcwine.&gt;

Take this to her, with my thanks for sending you. Let her know that your efforts helped replenish our Arcwine supplies and reunited a mother and child.

We are grateful beyond measure. Farewell for now.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Activate the teleporter pad and bring Vanthir's gift to Thalyssra.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Vanthir is a very pleasant fellow.</RewardText>
