  <Title>Ephemeral Manastorm Projector</Title>
  <Description>Oculeth's theory is sound. Reckless, but sound.

A small warp-field could trap and excite ambient mana in the conduit, thus creating a manastorm similar to when the arcan'dor fell out of balance.

I can build a device to generate the warp-field, but I need materials.

Specifically, warp-resistant alloys - such as the armor plating of high-end security constructs in the noble district.

Those constructs are deadly. If anyone owes you a favor, now is the time to call it in.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Warp-Resistant Plating from Chronarch Defenders.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Without those plates, the E.M.P. would rip itself apart in seconds.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These will do nicely.</RewardText>
