  <Title>Scouting the Breach</Title>
  <Description>If Ly'leth's information is accurate, there is a breach in the Sanctum of Order that could be our only way into the Nighthold.

No doubt they have magically sealed it - take Valtrois and protect her while she examines the seal. She is an exceptional talent, and I have total faith in her ability to break whatever enchantment they have cooked up.

Valtrois has her own methods of getting into the city and will meet you inside the Sanctum of Order.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Aid Valtrois underneath the Sanctum of Order in Suramar City.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It appears Ly'leth was correct. This is an entrance to the Nightwell - and it is well protected. Nothing is impenetrable though.$b$bLet us have a look at the ley lines powering this shield, shall we?</RewardText>
