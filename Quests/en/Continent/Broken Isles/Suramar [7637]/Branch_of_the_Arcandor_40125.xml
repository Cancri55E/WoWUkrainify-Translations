  <Title>Branch of the Arcan'dor</Title>
  <Description>You have used the spellstone of Kel'danath to soothe countless withered. Yet it contains merely a shade of the arcan'dor's power, drawn from its slumbering seed. 

&lt;Thalyssra holds aloft a gleaming white branch.&gt;

This fell from the tree. Though it is severed, it is not dead - invisible threads of magic bind all pieces of the arcan'dor together.

I have enchanted this branch with a new iteration of Kel'danath's charm spell. With it, you can mend the arcane essence of even more withered. Use it well.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Thalyssra.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I never imagined I would spend my time in exile studying withered. Through them, I have learned a great deal about my own people, and the nature of our relationship with the Nightwell.</RewardText>
