  <Title>Trail of Echoes</Title>
  <Description>The Nightborne could prove powerful allies against the Legion. We must aid this Thalyssra if we can.

We should be able to find her by tracking her magical echoes, the same way I found her distress call.

I can teleport you near the location where she recorded that message. From there, you must search for ripples in the very fabric of the arcane itself.

My wand should do the trick. Follow the sparks it creates--they should lead you to places where Thalyssra used her magic.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Khadgar's Wand to find Arcane Echoes and track down First Arcanist Thalyssra.</LogDescription>
