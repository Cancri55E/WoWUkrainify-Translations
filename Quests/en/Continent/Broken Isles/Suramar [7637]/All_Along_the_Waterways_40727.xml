  <Title>All Along the Waterways</Title>
  <Description>I've noticed some wandering eyes, lately.

I am more than happy to continue delivering the goods to Vanthir, but it is getting increasingly dangerous to do so. 

The Duskwatch that walk the bazaar are by far the most observant.

Find and slay the Orbitists so that I may deliver the goods safely.

I will follow behind with the shipment.</Description>
