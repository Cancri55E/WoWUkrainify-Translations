  <Title>Kura's Vengeance</Title>
  <Description>I was a wing-guard myself, once upon a time.$B$BOne afternoon, I was caught away from my post. I just wanted an hour to watch the festival... Kuuan was supposed to cover for me, but instead he sold me out to gain favor with our superiors.$B$BThey plucked my eyes, broke my wings, and threw me off the spire.$B$BYet I am the fortunate one, for if Iskar hadn't found me, I'd have died there. And now Kuuan shows his face in Veil Shadar on the same day that you show up willing to kill for coin. Fortunate, indeed.</Description>
