  <Description>My goods used to be for the very best, now the Iron Horde make copies out of poor metal and give them to everyone.$b$bI'm going to show them what a real smith can do in your arsenal, but first I'm going to need a powerful flux to make the metal as pure as it can get.$b$bThe dust from crushed iridium geodes would work in a pinch but we need to find some first. They tend to congregate underground, so check out the mine in Kuuro's Claim nearby.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather $1oa Iridium Dust from Iridium Geodes in Kuuro's Claim.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This won't be as good as some of the mixes we had back in the Blackrock foundries, but it will do.</RewardText>
