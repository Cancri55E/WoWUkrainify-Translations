  <Description>To secure the fortress we need to kill Witch Lord Morkurk, but I don't think we should go straight after him.$B$BHis three lieutenants - Vorgorsh, Zulmork, and Cromaug - are all powerful mages, and all of them are fiercely loyal to Morkurk.$B$BI suspect that if we engage the Witch Lord that they will rush to his aid. Let's take them out so that cannot happen.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Vizier Vorgorsh, Vizier Zulmork, and Vizier Cromaug.</LogDescription>
