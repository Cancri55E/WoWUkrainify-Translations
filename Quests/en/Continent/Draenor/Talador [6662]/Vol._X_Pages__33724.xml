  <Title>Vol. X Pages ?</Title>
  <Description>The manual for the shredder was wedged in there, but it's missing lots of pages. We need to find as many pages of that manual as possible and I might--MIGHT--be able to get this shredder operational.

Based on the direction of the wind, I bet the pages flew toward Archenon Siegeyard.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find $1oa Manual Pages at Archenon Siegeyard.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Lots of detail... almost as if a goblin wrote it!</RewardText>
