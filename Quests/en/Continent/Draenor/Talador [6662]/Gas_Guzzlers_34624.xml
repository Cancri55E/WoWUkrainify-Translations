  <Title>Gas Guzzlers</Title>
  <Description>To complete my master's designs and to stock up the artillery tower we need to use an exotic resource, namely goren gut gas.$b$bThe nearby mine at Kuuro's Claim just came down with an infestation of the things. Could you collect a few samples for me? The stuff is concentrated, so only a few are needed. Just kill one and give its body a good prod with this gas extractor.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain $1oa samples of Goren Gas from Glowgullet Shardshedders and Glowgullet Devourers within Kuuro's Claim.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Fascinating isn't it? The gas is extremely corrosive to almost anything.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, this is just what I needed.$b$bGoren gas is rather difficult to come by but thankfully we can make this supply go a long way.</RewardText>
