  <Title>Going to the Gordunni</Title>
  <Description>We have a good supply of jovite now but there just isn't enough of the material in the mine to keep the artillery tower in stock for long. Down south of here there's a mountain that's just full of the stuff but there's one problem; Ogres!$b$bThe Gordunni live on top of that mountain and they have begun trading the jovite to the Iron Horde.$b$bWe need to go down there and secure the minerals for ourselves.$b$bI'll pack some supplies and meet you near their fortress down south.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel to Gordal Fortress and meet up with Miall.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I crafted a few things before we left that we may need: some smoke grenades, a grappling hook, even was able to get Thaelin to throw together a rocket pack.$b$bI'm sure we'll find a use for everything.</RewardText>
