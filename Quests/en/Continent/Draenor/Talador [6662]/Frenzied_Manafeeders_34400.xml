  <Title>Frenzied Manafeeders</Title>
  <Description>There is a rare breed of moth in Talador known as the Manafeeder. These moths sustain themselves by feeding on arcane crystal dust from the mine.$b$bTypically speaking, these moths are nothing more than an occasional nuisance. However, they are now gorging themselves upon the intense arcane energy flooding out of the mine and have become highly territorial and aggressive.$b$bI have attuned this crystal to disperse arcane energy. Please use it on the Frenzied Manafeeders to soothe them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Arcane Dissipator on $oa Frenzied Manafeeders.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you used the Arcane Dissipator on the Manafeeders yet?</CompletionText>
