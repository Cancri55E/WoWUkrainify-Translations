  <Title>Requisition a Riverbeast</Title>
  <Description>I have seen great beasts floating slowly along the rivers of Talador. The 'riverbeasts,' I believe they are called.$B$BTheir hides are solid, like rock, and yet they float along the waters easily. I would quite like to see one of these up close, if you should head that way. Tormak has created for you another rope, if you are interested.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Riverbeast Lasso on a Young Riverwallow and follow it until it is tamed.</LogDescription>
