  <Title>Supply Recovery</Title>
  <Description>We seem to have arrived at just the right time!$b$bThe Gordunni have been enchanting armaments for the Iron Horde and it looks like they haven't picked up the latest shipment.$b$bWe could put that gear to far better use in our artillery tower! Lets go hunt down their shipping containers. I brought some signal flares that we can use to call in an air pick-up when we've secured the shipment.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover $1oa Iron Horde Shipments.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Thaelin said that the flares will surely get his copters attention. I hope those contraptions actually work.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Alright, that should be the last one we need. $b$bIt isn't the same as retaking Shattrath, but knowing the Iron Horde won't be getting these supplies gives me a bit of satisfaction.</RewardText>
