  <Title>Out of Jovite</Title>
  <Description>Ared and I came this way because we needed a good supply of metal to build his designs and some of the best metal is the jovite that comes from the mine in Kuuro's Claim. In order to supply the artillery tower I'm going to need this metal.$b$bUnfortunately that place was recently overwhelmed by a pack of goren, so you're going to have to fight your way in to get the ore before they manage to devour it.$b$bNothing that should be too much of a problem for you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 12 chunks of Jovite Ore from within Kuuro's Claim.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We need to get that ore before those goren eat it all.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These look pretty good. Ared would have loved to get his hands on these.$b$b&lt;Miall wipes away a tear.&gt;$b$b I'm sorry, this is making me too emotional, these will do just fine.</RewardText>
