  <RewardText>Wow... I've never seen anyone fight like that. That was... impressive.$B$BI'm in no shape to join Lady Liadrin and the others at Auchindoun now. You have an entire fortress on this world, though. Could I go there and rest awhile? Maybe repair my armor?$B$BI'll stick around and join your forces as a token of my gratitude. Liadrin won't mind... we're all on the same team, right?</RewardText>
