  <Title>Gas Guzzlers</Title>
  <Description>$g Sir:Ma'am;, to make the best equipment for your arsenal I need not only the best materials, but to use the best techniques.$b$bOver the years I've developed a method to greatly strengthen my metal, but it does require an exotic resource: goren gut gas!$b$bThe nearby mine at Kuuro's Claim just came down with an infestation of the things. Could you collect a few samples for the arsenal supplies? Just kill a few goren and give their bodies a good prod with this gas extractor.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain $1oa samples of Goren Gas from Glowgullet Shardshedders and Glowgullet Devourers within Kuuro's Claim.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you boss, this is just what I needed.$b$bBy the way, Goren gas is rather difficult to come by. We should probably hold off on clearing those guys out till we can stockpile enough.$b$bJust a thought.</RewardText>
