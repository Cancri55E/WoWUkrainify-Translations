  <Title>WANTED: Kil'uun</Title>
  <Description>I have a bounty set on a bird, commander. Yes, a bird.$B$BThe issue is this thing is massive, and it was last sighted a stone's throw away from the Horde base to the south in the forest. The locals call it Kil'uun.$B$BIf you'd like to track the creature down and bring back its beak I wager it would fetch a sack or two of gold for your coffers!</Description>
