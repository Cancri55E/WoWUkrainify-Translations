  <Title>Iridium Recovery</Title>
  <Description>Ared used to always teach me that the purity of the metal is key. If the metal isn't pure it will crack under stress and be of no use to anyone.$b$bFor the artillery tower to function I'll need to make metal as pure as my master would, and for that I need a strong flux.$b$bThe dust from crushed iridium geodes would work in a pinch, but we need to find some first. They tend to congregate underground, so check out the mine in Kuuro's Claim nearby.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather $1oa Iridium Dust from Iridium Geodes in Kuuro's Claim.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I'm going to need a lot of iridium dust to purify the metal to anywhere near my masters standards.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This won't be as good as some of the stuff we had back at the forge in Shattrath, but it will do.</RewardText>
