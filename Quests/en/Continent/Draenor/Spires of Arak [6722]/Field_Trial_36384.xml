  <Title>Field Trial</Title>
  <Description>Look, I didn't tell Kimzee about this because I don't want to hurt her feelings, I chose not to leave Pinchwhistle Point.$b$bSee, I've been working on a serum that I think should be able to cure the infected, but when I tried to test it I got surrounded and I injured my leg during the escape.$b$bI know I'm on the right track but I need to test it. Do me a favor and take this vial and go try it out on one of the infected outside.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Venture into Pinchwhistle Point and use the Vial of Untested Serum on an Infected Bruiser or Infected Lumberjack.  Return to Krixel Pinchwhistle to report the results.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you completed the field test, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The serum did what!??!$b$bI must have used too much growth hormone. Possibly... the mixture just needs to be shaken prior to dosage?</RewardText>
