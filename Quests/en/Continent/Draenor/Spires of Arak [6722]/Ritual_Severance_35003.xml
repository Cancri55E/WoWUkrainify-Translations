  <Description>I could not defeat this curse, and long ago resigned myself to rest in darkness.$B$BBut the Sethekk are performing dark rituals to draw me back, slowly binding me to Sethe's will. Should they succeed, Sethe would have me draw a dark cloak across the horizon, and bathe the world in his blood.$B$BDisrupt their rituals, so that I may return with my own free will. Then, together, we shall bring an end to Sethe's return.</Description>
