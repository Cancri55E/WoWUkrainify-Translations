  <Title>Warchief's Command: Spires of Arak!</Title>
  <Description>All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Azik in Spires of Arak.

There have been wingless arakkoa seen fleeing from Spires of Arak. Rumors suggest that they are running from an Iron Horde superweapon.

We need to find out what is causing them to leave their homeland, and why their wings have withered.

For the Horde!</Description>
