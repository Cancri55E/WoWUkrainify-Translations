  <Title>The Avatar of Terokk</Title>
  <Description>My long sleep was disturbed by dreams of the past. I cut down my old enemies again. I watched my daughter die again.

You were there. I felt your presence in these dreams. And your past was revealed to me as well.

Someone has woven our fates together. My people are yours to protect, and your enemies are mine to destroy.

The Shattered Hand are rallied in Bladefist Hold. Left to their own, they would claim this land for the Iron Horde.

Take my power, and together we shall break them.</Description>
