  <Description>Commander, our status report is... regrettable.$B$BWe'll be out of supplies in a few days' time, and that's assuming we have any troops left by then. $B$BThere's just enough material left to put up an inn or a trading post.$B$BThe inn would allow us to station fresh troops here, but the trading post would open up potential supply routes with the outcasts nearby.$B$BI've left out Gazlowe's blueprints on the drafting table. We await your will.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Inspect the Drafting Table and choose which outpost structure to construct.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Your will be done.$B$BFor the Horde!</RewardText>
