  <Description>I found this dwarf, Thuldren, runnin' out of Tangleheart like his boots were on fire.

Says his mole machine showed up here and he barely made it out alive. And another called Frenna might still be inside.

One useful thing he told me is that the creatures in there have sap that can be used to grow things real fast.

By the way, I'm gonna go lookin' for Thuldren's mole machine. Find me in Tangleheart when you're done.</Description>

  <RewardText>You got it! You should be able to use this mole machine one way back to your outpost.</RewardText>
