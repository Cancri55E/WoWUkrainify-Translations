  <Title>Rescue Rangari</Title>
  <Description>Many of our rangari have not been accounted for. It would seem the followers of Iyu have taken captives.$b$bWe will continue to search the area for survivors.$b$bIn the meantime, follow the Wildwood Wash west toward Highpass and look for any signs of our rangari comrades.$b$bOur people are stout and capable survivors. You may find more than you expect. Have them stay near the road and we will follow as soon as this... dwarf creature... has fixed his mechanical vessel.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Rangari Rajess, Rangari Kolaan, and Rangari Jonaa.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It is no small thing for us to welcome so many strangers into our camps. Gorgrond is not the sort of place that breeds trust easily.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The rangari are stout survivalists. I knew they would not go down without a fight.$b$bThank you, $p, for your help in this. You have done us a great honor.</RewardText>
