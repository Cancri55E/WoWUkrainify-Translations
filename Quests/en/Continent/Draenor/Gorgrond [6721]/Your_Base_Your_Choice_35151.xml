  <Title>Your Base, Your Choice</Title>
  <Description>You have already constructed an impressive garrison in Frostfire. I believe I should defer this next choice to you.$b$bOne region of Gorgrond is rich in resources. A lumber mill could help us make the most of them.$b$bAnother region harbors hardened gladiators. A sparring arena would help persuade them to fight for our cause.$b$bEither path will strengthen us as we seek to find and weaken the Iron Horde.$b$bWhich do you choose, Commander?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Choose to construct either a Lumber Mill or a Sparring Arena at Beastwatch.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>A fine choice. It will need more work before such a structure could be built in your garrison, but this is a start.</RewardText>
