  <Title>Hero's Call: Gorgrond!</Title>
  <Description>All able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Yrel in Gorgrond.

Yrel and Maraad are requesting for a small expedition to be sent into the wilds of Gorgrond.

We hope to gain a better understanding of the land in hopes that it will show us how to exploit weaknesses in the Iron Horde.

Assist them with their expedition.

Glory to the Alliance!</Description>
