  <Title>Tangleheart</Title>
  <Description>The Rangari have been here for a tick, and they hear tell from the Laughing Skull o' a place called Tangleheart.

Seems some really bad ancients come from there, and botani use a kind o' sap to grow them quickly.

I think we could use that for yer outpost. Hey, wood is wood, right?

I'll meet ya there.</Description>
