  <Title>Chapter II: The Harvest</Title>
  <Description>I have seen a creature working with the ancient saplings, imbuing them with anger and hatred toward creatures unlike them.

Perhaps it is this botani who is responsible for the unusually aggressive nature of ancients here in Tangleheart.

Would killing this botani do us good? I fear I would be no match for it alone.
