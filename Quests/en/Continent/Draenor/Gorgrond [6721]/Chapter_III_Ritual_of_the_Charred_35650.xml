  <Title>Chapter III: Ritual of the Charred</Title>
  <Description>I have seen a strange ritual performed by ancients. They step into fire, burning the leaves from their branches and charring their bark.

I call it the Ritual of the Charred. If we want to weaken the ancients, we can get rid of them before they become even stronger.
