  <Title>The Battle for the West</Title>
  <Description>Our base is barely built and already the Iron Horde sets up defenses against us. Still the plan worked and we fight on two fronts.$b$bI have received word that Exarch Maladaar has finally breached the western gates as well, but is bogged down in a pitched battle. You should go see the situation for yourself.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Go to the Iron Front and speak with Exarch Maladaar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Now you see what we face here. We will keep as much pressure here as we can so your base can remain free to attack all over the jungle.</RewardText>
