  <Title>Setting the Signal</Title>
  <Description>$G Sir : Ma'am;, we built a vehicle to bypass the Horde camp and take you to the Throne of Kil'jaeden! There's one problem, the concentrated fel energy up there is causing the navigation system to go haywire!

Just be sure to have some friends with you, the demons up there look especially vicious!</Description>
