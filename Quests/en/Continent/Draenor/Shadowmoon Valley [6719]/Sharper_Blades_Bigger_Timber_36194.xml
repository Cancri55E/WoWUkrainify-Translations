  <Title>Sharper Blades, Bigger Timber</Title>
  <Description>Incredible news, Commander $n. Your ever-loyal servant has managed to secure us commandojacks. Now maybe you don't know what a commandojack is, so let me explain: they're like lumberjacks, only highly trained in the art of killing. Mostly they're out of work mercenaries and assassins.$B$BWhat this means is that we can now cut medium sized timber - but first we need to give these commandojacks a test run.$B$BThere's a suitable tree nearby. Good luck!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Harvest a Timber Sample from Timber and return it to Justin Timberlord.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you harvest that timber sample yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We haven't even scratched the surface when it comes to overkill.$B$BIt looks like this group will serve you well, $g sir:ma'am;. Medium sized trees across Draenor are now at your mercy. That means more timber per tree!</RewardText>
