  <Title>Soul Shards of Summoning</Title>
  <Description>It's good to know what Teron'gor and Cho'gall are up to. It's more important that we stop Gul'dan.$B$BSome of his disciples can summon minor demons. To do this, these lesser warlocks must use a soul shard. The foul crystal creates a connection to the Twisting Nether, pulling a demon through against its will.$B$BGul'dan's as much demon as he is orc. If we can gather some of the more potent shards, we can combine them into something that just might capture him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect Kurgoth's Shard, Grogal's Shard, and Hagra's Shard.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the shards, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Now all that's left to do is to fashion them together into something strong enough to ensnare Gul'dan.$B$BLuckily, we can do that right here.</RewardText>
