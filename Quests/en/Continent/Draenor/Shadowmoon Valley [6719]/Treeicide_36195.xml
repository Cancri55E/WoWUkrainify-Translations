  <Description>Commander, your engineers have brought you a present. They call it the Wood Annihilator XXI the Third, Jr.$B$BWhat's it do? I reckon it annihilates trees - but more importantly it will allow for the harvesting of large timber. Do you know how much timber a large tree holds? Me neither, but I bet it's a lot!$B$BThere's a large piece of timber ready to be annihilated nearby. Why don't you give the contraption a test run? Bring me back whatever it harvests and I'll put it to good use.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Harvest a Timber Sample from Large Timber and return it to Justin Timberlord.</LogDescription>
