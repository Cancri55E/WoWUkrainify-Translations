  <Title>A Curse Upon the Woods</Title>
  <Description>Cordana tells me that the creatures of the woods are cursed by the same fel energies keeping Khadgar from scrying into the orc village.$B$BThis will not do.$B$BIf we were on Azeroth, I could find a cure in a reasonable timeframe. However, we are not, nor do we have the luxury of time.$B$BBetter to put a swift end to their suffering rather than allow these poor creatures to linger with demonic energy.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa fel-cursed creatures in the Cursed Woods.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I know it may seem harsh, and I'll understand if you decide not to do it.$B$BHowever, the sooner you kill those poor creatures, the sooner their suffering will come to an end.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Grim business. I wish that it could have gone differently.$B$BThank you for your dedication, $n. Be comforted in the fact that Elune understands.</RewardText>
