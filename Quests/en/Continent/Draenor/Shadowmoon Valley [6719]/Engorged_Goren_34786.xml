  <Title>Engorged Goren</Title>
  <Description>You must be the $c that so impressed Exarch Hataaru. Can you help?$b$bThe Elodor Dig just behind me is overrun by strange stone creatures. These so-called goren actually devour minerals, metabolize them, and grow crystalline structures from their arms and back. Like most of the wildlife on this world, they completely baffle us.$b$bPlease slay as many as you can and gather their crystal scales for me. You'll be protecting our earthworkers and aiding our research at the same time.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1Oa Crystallized Goren Scales from Crystalmaw goren in the Elodor Dig.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What's the status inside the dig?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The artificer withdraws a loop and peers intently at the scales you've brought him.&gt;$b$bUnreal. The crystalline matrix is flawless, as if produced from one of our forges on Argus.$b$bI wish we could hook up these creatures to our machinery... but I suspect the Exarch would take issue with that.$b$bThank you for your help!</RewardText>
