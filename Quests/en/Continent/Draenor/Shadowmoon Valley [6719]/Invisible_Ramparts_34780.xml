  <Title>Invisible Ramparts</Title>
  <Description>Exarch Akama is too cautious, but we shouldn't ignore a threat from the Shadowmoon clan. It is good you are here!$b$bSince we arrived on Draenor I have dedicated myself to recreating the technology we left behind. This large structure here is a defense ward. It should counter a Shadowmoon advance - provided we power it up.$b$bI have prepared resonance crystals at my workshop to the south. Carry one crystal at a time to the three pylons that surround the ward, then activate the control panel nearby!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Carry charged resonance crystals to the primary, secondary, and tertiary pylons.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The console thrums with energy and lights up as you draw near, as though sensing your presence. Simply touching the main panel brings the defense crystal to life outside.$b$bIf this is the kind of technology Hataaru was able to cobble together from spare parts, you can only imagine the splendor of the world he came from.</RewardText>
