  <Description>$GSir:Ma'am;, the storehouse is fully operational and I've seen to it that your supplies are safely stored away and accounted for.

Unfortunately, during the rest of my audit I found that we are missing a few crates of surplus material - probably misplaced by one of the porters.

If you happen to come across any of the surplus crates while making your rounds, please bring them to me and I'll update our ledger.</Description>
