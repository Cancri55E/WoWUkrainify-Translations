  <Title>The Sting</Title>
  <Description>The exarchs seem to trust you, $c. Are you venturing into the Umbrafen?$b$bThe Sporebats in this area are usually docile, but something's got them all riled up. When they attack, their stingers wrap around exposed limbs. I've seen them tear through reinforced leather like it was paper. How do they work, I wonder?$b$bCould you bring me a pristine sporebat stinger? I'd love to study it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Acquire a Pristine Sporebat Stinger from a Moonglow Sporebat.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Most draenei avoid the Umbrafen, but we rangari seem drawn to the most dangerous places - that's where you really learn how the world works.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Would you look at that - the entire tentacle is barbed. Uggh. No wonder the wounds they inflict tend to get infected. We could learn something from this. I wonder if rangari explorers should start equipping themselves with whips?$b$bThank you, $n. This Alliance that you come from must be quite the collection of heroes!</RewardText>
