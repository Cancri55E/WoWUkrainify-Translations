  <Title>Fun with Fungus</Title>
  <Description>It is our mission as rangari to explore and understand this world. Around you is the Umberfen. Many draenei lost their lives when we first discovered this place. The volatile spores burst whenever anyone approaches.$b$bBut we watched... and we learned.$b$bAround the swamp you'll notice "Shimmershrooms," distinguished by their orange glowcaps. Their dust will make you invisible to the volatile spores. Grab the spores - gently! - and bring them to me.$b$bWe will forge this savage world into a weapon.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Shimmershrooms to safely gather $oa Volatile Spores.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Remember, unless you are covered in shimmershroom dust, the spores will explode as soon as you get near.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Careful with those... hand them here. Wonderful!$b$bI will have my rangari bury these around the perimeter of Elodor. If the Shadowmoon orcs dare attack us again, they are in for a nasty surprise!$b$bDraenor is a hostile world, but if we take the time to learn and understand it, we can turn it to our advantage.$b$bI will finish up here and meet with the Exarch Council shortly. I will be sure to back your proposal.</RewardText>
