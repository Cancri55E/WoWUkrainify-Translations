  <Title>Sharper Blades, Bigger Timber</Title>
  <Description>Incredible news, Commander $n. Your ever-loyal servant (that's me) has managed to secure us timber lords. Now maybe you don't know what a timber lord is, so let explain: think of a blood-crazed, mass murderer who enjoys nothing more than killing. Now take that same enthusiasm for killing and apply it to killing trees! That's a timber lord.$B$BWhat this means is that we can now cut medium sized timber - but first we need to give these timber lords a test run.$B$BThere's a suitable tree nearby. Good luck!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Harvest a Timber Sample from Timber and return it to Lumber Lord Oktron.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You didn't believe me about those timber lords, did you? Well now you know.$B$BIt looks like this group will serve you well, $g sir:ma'am;. Medium sized trees across Draenor are now at your mercy. That means more timber per tree!</RewardText>
