  <Title>Return to the Pack</Title>
  <Description>Part of me agrees with Karg - we COULD challenge the Iron Wolf right now. My fists clench at the mention of his name. My muscles scream for vengeance.$B$BBut then, in my heart, I feel Asha. Calming me. Guiding me. I do not deserve her wisdom, but it is a gift I will not waste.$B$B&lt;Lokra squints at the sky.&gt;$B$BDurotan and the others will be gathering at your garrison about now. We should meet them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Durotan at your garrison.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak with Durotan at your garrison.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Lokra has always lacked the patience and control of her older sister. She approaches problems head-first, and relies on her raw talents to succeed.$B$BSeeing the way her and Karg look at each other, I am not surprised she chased him all the way to Grom'gar. What surprises me is that they made it back.$B$BAs usual, I expect we have you to thank for that. You continue to honor us with your deeds.</RewardText>
