  <Description>You have honored my people. Now, we wish to honor you.$b$bWe have a rite of initiation in my clan. When one comes of age, they cover themselves in the blood of their first hunt, and rest their hands upon a shamanstone to honor the ancestors who came before them.$b$bIn our brief time together you have already slain many foes more fierce than our hunters have ever had to face. Go, touch the shamanstone here in Wor'gol, and join our pack as an equal.</Description>
