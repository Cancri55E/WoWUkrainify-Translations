  <Description>If we leave now, my clan's final assault on Grom'gar will be a disaster.$B$BThough our warriors are unmatched in melee, the Thunderlords have new ranged weapons - our forces would be decimated as they cross the Icewind Drifts.$B$BBut WE are already here. We can overtake those weapons before they ever fire.$B$BBlackrock orcs help our enemies forge these "cannons" in the workshops on the south side. If we use their own tools to sabotage the weapons, we leave Grom'gar wide open to a Frostwolf raid.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Blackrock Blasting Powder to destroy 5 Iron Horde Cannons in Grom'gar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>See how their machines fail them! There is no better weapon than pure orc muscle!</RewardText>
