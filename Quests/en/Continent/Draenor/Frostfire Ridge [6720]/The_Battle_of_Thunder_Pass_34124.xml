  <Description>The Iron Horde has an army tenfold our number marching down the Thunder Pass as we speak.$b$bDurotan is amassing our forces at the mouth of the pass. He is doing what he can to mount a defense but war on this scale is not what we Frostwolves are masters of.$b$bHe will need your expertise.$b$bPlease, go to him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defend Frostfire Ridge from the Iron Horde.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This was a costly victory, and a very painful lesson. We chose to refuse the Iron Horde and live as we always have, but I see now they will never respect such neutrality.$b$bI am not about to wait for the Iron Horde to martial their forces. We will fight with you, and bring the Iron Horde to its knees.$b$bCommander, the Frostwolves stand ready!</RewardText>
