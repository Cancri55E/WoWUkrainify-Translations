  <Description>The inn provides a perfect place for adventurers to take a rest between their travels. It's also a great place to talk them into joining our cause over a few rounds of drinks.

Go through my selection and let's see if we can obtain a new recruit. I'll give you a little something as a finder's fee for your efforts.</Description>
