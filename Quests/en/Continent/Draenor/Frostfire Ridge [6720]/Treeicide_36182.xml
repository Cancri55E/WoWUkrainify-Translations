  <Title>Tree-i-cide</Title>
  <Description>Commander, the goblins have brought you a present. They call it the Tree Murderer 9000.$B$BWhat's it do? I reckon it murders trees - but more importantly it will allow for the harvesting of large timber. Do you know how much timber a large tree holds? Me neither, but I bet it's a lot!$B$BThere's a large piece of timber ready to be murdered nearby. Why don't you give the contraption a test run? Bring me back whatever it harvests and I'll put it to good use.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Harvest a Timber Sample from Large Timber and return it to Lumber Lord Oktron.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This is fantastic! This sample indicates massive timber reserves in the large timber found across Draenor. And now with the Tree Murderer 9000 at your disposal you'll be able to chop those towering monstrosities down with ease.</RewardText>
