  <Title>Tricks of the Trade</Title>
  <Description>To pass the time, traders have been known to consume beverages of an inspired nature, if you know what I mean.

Sometimes, they drink a bit too much. Your trader might have stumbled beyond the gates and passed out under a tree. It's been known to happen from time to time.

Luckily, I have a brew that I use to rouse groggy traders. One splash and I find they're more willing to work.</Description>
