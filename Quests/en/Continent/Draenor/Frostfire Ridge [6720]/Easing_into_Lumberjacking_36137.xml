  <Title>Easing into Lumberjacking</Title>
  <Description>$G Sir:Ma'am;, we're going to need a lot of lumber if we're going to build this garrison into a suitable fortress. That means we're going to have to do a little work.$B$BWhile I certainly wouldn't ask you to dirty your hands with manual labor, I do need you to go out and find timber for our mill. Once you mark a tree an able-bodied lazy-good-for-nothing peon will come and chop it down and give you the timber.$B$BFrostfire isn't the best place for timber, but I did see a suitable small tree nearby.</Description>
