  <Description>Gronnsbane now pulses with energies of fire and frost. All that remains to restore the full power of the weapon is to receive the Blessing of the Beast. Argoram believed this could be accomplished by bloodying the weapon against one of the ancient black rylaks of Stonefury Cliffs. His journal reads:

"High in the Stonefury Cliffs, I have seen an altar where the ogres have left offerings to these ancient beasts. Perhaps I could use it to lure one of them"</Description>
