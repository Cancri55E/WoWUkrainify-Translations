  <Title>Salvaging the Situation</Title>
  <Description>Here at the Salvage Yard we inspect any extra material your followers bring back from the field, preserving anything that may be useful.

I have an extra pack of material our people brought in that I've yet to go through. Why don't you take it over to the incinerator and see if it contains anything useful?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Small Sack of Salavaged Goods near the incinerator at your Salvage Yard.</LogDescription>
