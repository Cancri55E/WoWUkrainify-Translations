  <Title>A Clew of Worms</Title>
  <Description>While I was scouting, I noticed that most of Frostwind Crag is crawling with an odd species of worm.$B$BThe worst thing about them is that these things burrow under the ground and then spring on you from out of nowhere.$B$BI saw the worms attacking the frost wolves and other wildlife in the wastes. I'm certain the orcs would appreciate you helping out.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa Wastes Rockworms.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We haven't seen these creatures here in a generation.$B$BTheir sudden appearance and the shaking of the ground are most definitely connected.</RewardText>
