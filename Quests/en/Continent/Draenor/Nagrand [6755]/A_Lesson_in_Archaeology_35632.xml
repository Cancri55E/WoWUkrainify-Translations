  <Title>A Lesson in Archaeology</Title>
  <Description>As an archaeologist, it's important to make great discoveries and contributions to the field. Why? Because that's how you make a name for yourself!$b$bEven that hack Harrison Jones has a somewhat reputable name. If he can do it, then you can too!$b$bThe Highmaul are hiding something big in that cave of theirs and we need to get in there and take it!$b$bTake this teleportation beacon and make your way to the back of the cave. Once you find the relic, place the beacon and my team will take care of the rest!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover the Mysterious Artifact.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you found the Highmaul relic yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Great work back there! That's how real archaeology is done!$b$bIt's a good thing you came to me to learn the trade, kid. You've got talent and I'd hate to see it wasted on a putz like Harrison Jones!</RewardText>
