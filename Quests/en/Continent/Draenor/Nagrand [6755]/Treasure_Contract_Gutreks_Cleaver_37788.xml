  <Title>Treasure Contract: Gutrek's Cleaver</Title>
  <Description>In Nagrand, the ogres tell of an ancient weapon called Gutrek's cleaver. I would very much like to study it.

A goblin treasure hunter by the name of Val Goldspade discovered the whereabouts of the weapon. Unfortunately, this goblin has gone missing somewhere in the Broken Precipice - probably after a run-in with the locals.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search the ogres in the Broken Precipice for clues regarding Goldspade's discovery.</LogDescription>
