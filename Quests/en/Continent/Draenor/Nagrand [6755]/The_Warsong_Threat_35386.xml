  <CompletionText>What do you have for me?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Captain Washburn examines the attack plans, squinting at the lettering and holding the pages upside down.&gt;$b$bHmm... I see... yes... indeed!$b$bThese are obviously attack plans, as you yourself have stated, but they are most likely written by kobold pyromancers.$b$bStrange though, I haven't seen any kobold pyromancers since my days in Azeroth.
