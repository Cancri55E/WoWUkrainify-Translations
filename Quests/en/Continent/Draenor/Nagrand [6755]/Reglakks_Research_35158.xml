  <Title>Reglakk's Research</Title>
  <Description>Okay so these orders say Reglakk is in charge of something called Breaker research, which makes super powerful ogres. I don't know about you but that sounds bad.$b$bI'm pretty hurt, do you think you can go up there alone and make Reglakk rethink his research?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Stop Grand Magister Reglakk's research.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We stopped him for the time being, but I think we'll have to come up with a more permanent solution. No doubt he's back in Highmaul plotting new versions of Breakers.$B$BI think a visit to ogre capital is far overdue.</RewardText>
