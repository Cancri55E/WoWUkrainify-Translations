  <Title>A Lesson in Mineralogy</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Gazmolf gestures at the large machine nearby.&gt;$b$bI built this machine to break down elementium minerals into base elements. You see, it's not just what's buried within the ground that can be valuable; but also the ground itself!$b$bTake, for example, the earth elementals below us; inside every earth elemental is an earthen core, dense in precious metal!.$b$bThose elementals are going to make us rich! Collect several earthen cores, place them in the Gold-O-Matic 9000, and I'll give you a cut!</Description>
