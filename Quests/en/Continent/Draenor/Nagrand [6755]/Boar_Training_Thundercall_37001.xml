  <Title>Boar Training: Thundercall</Title>
  <Description>The elements can sometimes pose a problem for some beasts. Ever seen a ram in a thunderstorm? They'll hide behind anything larger than themselves. I'm not sure if they think the world is ending or what, but it's not great if you're atop one at the time.$B$BIn Nagrand, off on a windswept cliff high above the shore, is a creature made of pure thunderstorms. Hop atop your boar and face off against Thundercall, and we'll see if it gets spooked.</Description>
