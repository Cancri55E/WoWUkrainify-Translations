  <Description>The spirits of the dead have long been drawn to the mountain of Oshu'gun.$b$bAs long as I can remember, the woods have been filled with ancestral spirits making a ghostly pilgrimage to the heart of the mountain. I fear that the souls drawn to Oshu'gun are being consumed by the growing void within the mountain.$b$bMake your way to the Ancestral Grounds and commune with the spirits there for guidance.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with the spirits at the Ancestral Grounds.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The situation here is dire, $n, but I sensed that we would meet again.$b$bI do not hear the call of the void as loudly as the others, for I am not long dead and my body rests far from this place.$b$bWith time though, that will change.$b$bIf you are here to help, listen closely for time is short.</RewardText>
