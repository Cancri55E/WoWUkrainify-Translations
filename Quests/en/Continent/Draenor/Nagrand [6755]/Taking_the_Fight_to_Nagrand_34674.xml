  <Title>Taking the Fight to Nagrand</Title>
  <Description>**Eyes Only -- Commander $n**

With the fall of the rangari base at Telaar, Vindicator Yrel, recommended we establish a new foothold in Nagrand.

I've taken the liberty of dispatching some of our men and supplies. Rangari D'kaan's already reporting that a new outpost is nearly complete. He has indicated that they are ready to receive you.

A gryphon is waiting to catch you up with the latest caravan shipment whenever you're ready, $g sir:ma'am;.
