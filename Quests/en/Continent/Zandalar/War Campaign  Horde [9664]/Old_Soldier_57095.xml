  <Title>Old Soldier</Title>
  <Description>No matter what anyone says, he was an honorable orc. A legend in his own right, the ideal to which all warriors of the Horde aspired. 

He gave his life to heal the rift in the Horde and give us the chance to forge a new path forward. His was more than a death befitting a warrior. It was the death of a hero.

We shall honor his sacrifice.</Description>
