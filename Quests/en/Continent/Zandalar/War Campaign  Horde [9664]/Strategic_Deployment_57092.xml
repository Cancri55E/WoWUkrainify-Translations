  <Title>Strategic Deployment</Title>
  <Description>For years, I guarded the gates of Orgrimmar. The city's greatest weakness has always been its multiple entrances. We should strike at all of them to seize victory.

Wrynn and I have drawn up orders for deployment. The mages will cover our flank. Greymane will close in from the west, and the elves will take the north. We will send Mayla to reinforce Thunder Bluff's defenses in case Sylvanas launches a counterattack.

Bring the orders to our commanders.</Description>
