Our operatives are collapsing the pass between Razor Hill and Orgrimmar as we speak. Saurfang's treasonous forces will be cut in half.

Your task is to sneak into their ranks and sabotage their siege engines. Wear this disguise, but know that it will not hold up under close examination. Slay anyone who discovers you.</Description>
