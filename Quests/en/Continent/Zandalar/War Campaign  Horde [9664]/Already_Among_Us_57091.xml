  <Title>Already Among Us</Title>
  <Description>Sylvanas still commands the loyalty of many within the Horde. The war she started has blinded them with rage and hatred. She exploits that to maintain her support.

&lt;Saurfang scowls.&gt;

They do not yet see she will lead us to ruin, that her so-called victories are all hollow.

Some of her agents have been spotted lurking within our ranks. Kill them. They will show us no mercy, and will have none in return.</Description>
