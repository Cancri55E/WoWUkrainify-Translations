  <Title>This Ain't Mine</Title>
  <Description>Sylvanas's loyalists have collapsed part of the canyon path to Orgrimmar. Our forces are now cut off from each other.

We need to reinforce our front line or the Banshee will pick us off at her leisure. We have come too far to be slain by a thousand cuts.

Gazlowe and one of the Alliance's gnomes believe they have an answer. You'd best ensure that their plan does not backfire.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Clear the pass of boulders, mines, and other obstructions between Razor Hill and Orgrimmar.</LogDescription>
