  <Title>Gorilla Warfare</Title>
  <Description>Your timing is most fortuitous, stranger. I thank you for your assistance.

Things are not peaceful in Gorilla Gorge. The kaja'mite has given us great intelligence and wit. With intelligence has come war. 

My brethren are those who do not wish to fight. Neither the Zandalari trolls nor each other. But for our passivity we have been persecuted.

Please free my comrades. They will be in cages all throughout the gorge and under guard. Make haste!</Description>
