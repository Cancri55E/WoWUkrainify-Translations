  <Title>A Nose for Magic</Title>
  <Description>I have it! The readings from the ruins are unmistakable. Somewhere to the south and west of the ah... "foot", as it were, is a source of great magical energy.

It can be nothing but the Eye of Xibala!

We will need to place a few more scrying vessels to pinpoint the Eye's exact location.

Meet me deeper in the ruins. I will personally oversee this effort.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet Apprentice Telemancer Astrandis in western Xibala and aid him in his search for the Eye of Xibala.</LogDescription>
