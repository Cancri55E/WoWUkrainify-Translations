  <Title>One Road Ends</Title>
  <Description>&lt;A warm voice enters your mind.&gt;

There is one more wayshrine in this region that requires your attention.

Follow this road until you near its end at the Port of Zandalar.

It is there, at the start and end of so many journeys, that one of my most trafficked shrines was established. Restore it and see that any weary travelers have my blessing.

We will speak again when you are finished.</Description>
