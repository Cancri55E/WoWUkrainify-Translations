  <Title>Ptrust Fall</Title>
  <Description>I just want you to know how unusual this is for Pa'ku. She prefers to teach on the fly.

What? It's true.

This method might work. Sometimes when young pterrordax are not eager to fly, their mother will drag them from the nest and hold them in her claws until they are comfortable enough to spread their wings.

Seeing as this little one has no mother, you will use the kite to act as one.

Pa'ku has placed a trail for you to follow.

Go and glide carefully- you may frighten your pterrordax more!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Board the Huge Dragon Kite and take your pterrordax on a flight to build his confidence.</LogDescription>
