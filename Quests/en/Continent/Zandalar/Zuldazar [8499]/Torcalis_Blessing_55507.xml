  <Title>Torcali's Blessing</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Torcali's voice enters your mind.&gt;

Your actions speak to your intentions, $n.

I can see that my child will have the care she needs to grow strong, and grow she will. 

In the coming days she will recover the strength that would have been hers, if nature had been allowed to take its course. Tend to her, earn her loyalty, and I will allow you to keep her at your side.

This is my gift to you.

You may go now. She will bring you to me when it is time.</Description>
