  <Description>Name's Acadia, Acadia Chistlestone!

I represent the interests of the Explorer's League at this site. Where there's dirt to be turned, we're happy to do the digging!

&lt;Acadia's smile falters.&gt;

These Dark Iron, though, they're keen on delving deeper and faster than I'm comfortable with. Since you're a strong, capable member of the Alliance, do you think you could ah... lead by example?

Go on, there's a fresh fossil here that could use some attention.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Acadia Chistlestone recover a Xibalan fossil.</LogDescription>
