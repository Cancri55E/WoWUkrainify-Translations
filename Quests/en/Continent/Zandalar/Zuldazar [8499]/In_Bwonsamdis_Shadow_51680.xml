  <Title>In Bwonsamdi's Shadow</Title>
  <Description>Something is wrong, $n.

My king is blessed by de loa in ways your kind cannot imagine. He has been given long life, swift healing, and strength beyond most trolls. But still, he lingers on death's door. I can practically hear Bwonsamdi laughing.

Two of his most trusted menders are with him. Go and find out what is taking so long.

I will make sure dey are not interrupted.</Description>
