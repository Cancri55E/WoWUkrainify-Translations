  <Title>Morgrum's Extended Survey</Title>
  <Description>I've looked over the readings my little boxes gave an' I think I know where to look next. The Ashes of Xibala are practically mine.

Ye'll want to meet me in the middle of the ruins, under that big ol' leerin' skull on the mountainside, to continue my survey.

Readin' these contraptions is hard work, an' I don't think we'll be alone up there.

Think ye can watch me back?</Description>
