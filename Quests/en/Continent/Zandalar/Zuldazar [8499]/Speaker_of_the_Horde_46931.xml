  <RewardText>My father believes he is indulging me. He has ruled for two hundred years, many lifetimes of trolls. In his mind, de threats dat face our kingdom are minor.

I have seen too much to believe dat.

So since my father and his advisors would not help, I turned to someone who would.

Your warchief needs our fleet, and I need her champions. I have a battle plan here on what to do.

Choose your first move. If de Horde helps my people, den I will help de Horde.</RewardText>
