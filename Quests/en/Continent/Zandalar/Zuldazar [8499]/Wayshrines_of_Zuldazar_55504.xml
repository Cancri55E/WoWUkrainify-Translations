  <Description>&lt;A calm but thunderous voice enters your mind.&gt;

My child grows under your care. I am pleased. Now, I would have your aid.

There was a time long ago when the roads of Zandalar were under my protection. Those who walked them gave praise, and in return I gave them my blessing. Fewer wander now.

My shrines remain, their purpose forgotten. You will help me to restore them.

Begin in the north. See to the wayshrine there. If you find any lost travelers, see that they know my blessing through you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Restore the northern wayshrine and assist any travelers you come across.</LogDescription>
