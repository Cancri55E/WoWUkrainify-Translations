  <Description>This was all perpetrated by someone on the Zanchuli Council. 

They sacrificed their own people, Gral's followers, for Azshara. That is unconscionable!

They weaken the foundation, so the kingdom will fall.

One of your people must have direct access to the king. Anyone else could be the traitor.</Description>
