  <Title>Who Seeks the Seekers?</Title>
  <Description>Let me tell you, Zandalar is filled to the brim with ancient secrets. It's quite fascinating.

We heard tales of a region, to the southeast, where ships were losing their way. Some even vanished!

Raku, along with a team of particularly curious Seekers, has been exploring a cove near there for some time. Shipwrecks and mysteries, what isn't to like?

We should have heard back by now. We tortollans may not be fast, but we are reliable.

Will you check on them, and make sure they are well?</Description>
