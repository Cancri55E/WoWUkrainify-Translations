  <Title>Grand Theft Telemancy</Title>
  <Description>They must not keep the Eye, $n.

Fortunately I am more than an archaeologist. I am a telemancer. Chief Telemancer Oculeth himself trained the woman who trained my master. I can retrieve the relic with these arts.

All you need to do is place a telemancy beacon near the Eye. I can then retrieve both it AND you safely back to camp. The Alliance will find themselves empty-handed.

While you're at it, do deliver my "thanks" to the individual responsible for snatching the Eye out from under us.</Description>
