  <Title>Mista Nice</Title>
  <Description>I am normally not a violent tortollan, but if there is one thing I cannot abide, it is a scoundrel using children for his own profit.$b$bThe street scamps appear to be working at the behest of a ring leader. I do believe they call him "Mista Nice" though I suspect the name to be sarcastic in nature.$b$bI have a scroll here that can let you move among the scamps and see if they lead you back to Mista Nice. If they do, slay him and I shall pay you a bounty.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find and slay Mista Nice.</LogDescription>
