  <Title>Awaken a God</Title>
  <Description>You see the sinking ruins to the east? They were, not long ago, a temple to the shark loa, Gral.

The naga tore down his temple and are stealing his secrets. If it is for something good, I'll be a rock's uncle.

It would be wise to let Gral know what's going on here. I do not think he would approve.

Gral was quite powerful, and when it came to his knowledge of the sea, none could compare. It never hurts to have a fellow like that on your side.

Some fresh, bloody naga meat may just lure him out.</Description>
