  <Description>I know my king, and I know he is not weak willed. His spirit struggles under de weight of dis betrayal, and confusion roots his spirit too close to death for my comfort.

We will need to remind him of his purpose. His anger.

Perhaps de scent of vengeance can revive de devilsaur inside ol' Rastakhan.</Description>
