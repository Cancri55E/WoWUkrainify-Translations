  <Description>We have some thoughts on the best way to win over the Zandalari.

The princess is heading to Nazmir to take the fight to the blood trolls. Her voice carries much weight with the council and her father.

General Jakra'zet detests the Horde. Removing his voice from the Zanchuli Council will greatly improve our chances here.

We should also keep working on winning over the King here in Zuldazar. This city is vast and has many secrets.</Description>
