  <Description>Good. You have brought me the last ingredients I will need to concoct a solution to close the king's wounds.

You are not a moment too soon. He is fading.

I am not comfortable working at an elevated pace, but the situation requires it. You must be my hands, for I am very slow.

Bring me what I need, and let Jamil and I worry about the rest.

Speak to me when you are ready to begin.</Description>
