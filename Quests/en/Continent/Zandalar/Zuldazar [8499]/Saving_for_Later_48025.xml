  <Title>Saving for Later</Title>
  <Description>We need time to recover the artifacts from this place. Time the naga will not let us have.

However, we do have a plan.

We simply hide what we don't want them to find, and then come back in a decade or two. They will have forgotten about this place by then.

Take this illusion scroll and use it to conceal the notable artifacts of power.</Description>
