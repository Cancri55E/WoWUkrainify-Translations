  <Title>King Da'ka</Title>
  <Description>These Zandalari won't go near Gorilla Gorge. All because they're afraid!

It's just a few talking gorillas. And one 'big mon' in particular as the Zandalari call him. 

All we need to do is take out King Da'ka and the villagers will probably throw us a parade! Or at least let us mine that kaja'mite.

Think you can handle one big gorilla, chum?</Description>
