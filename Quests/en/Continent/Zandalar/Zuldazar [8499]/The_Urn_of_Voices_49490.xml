Regrettably his vision is incomplete. You will help me prepare for his demise and deal with his followers simultaneously. De tool you will use is called de Urn of Voices.

Take it and venture into Tal'gurub. Slay his followers, destroy their golems and masks. Their spirits, once released, will fill de urn.
