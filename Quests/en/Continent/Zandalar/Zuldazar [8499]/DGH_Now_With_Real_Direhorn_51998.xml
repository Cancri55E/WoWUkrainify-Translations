  <Title>DGH: Now With Real Direhorn</Title>
  <Description>...Listen, $n. I need one more thing to finish making this supplement of mine.

Direhorn Growth Hormone can't exactly be made without, you know, actual direhorn. But I floated the idea of harvesting a few of their beasts and all of a sudden I got a bunch of spears pointed at me.

So I came up with another plan.

Those flying beasts eat direhorns, right? The big green flappy ones. I'm sure if you kill a few of them you'll find all the direhorn bits I need.</Description>
