  <Title>Caged Wisdom</Title>
  <Description>Oh, hello, friend. 

It seems there is more here than for what we prepared.  

We sought. We found. We studied... and then we were taken. There are naga here. We did not expect this.

There is a nasty fellow in this cave. If you could get the key from him, it would help us greatly.

No need to fret, we'll wait here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take the key from Sli'thrus.</LogDescription>
