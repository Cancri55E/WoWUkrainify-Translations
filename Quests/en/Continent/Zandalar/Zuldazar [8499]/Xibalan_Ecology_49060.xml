  <Title>Xibalan Ecology</Title>
  <Description>I want to take me boys out and really dig our picks in, but every scout I've sent into the ruins just came back half mauled to death.

Some didn't come back at all.

From what I can tell, the ruins are home to more'n just these spiky grass-eaters. Do you think you could be a peach an' thin their numbers a bit?

I'd caution ye against tamperin' with the local ecology an' all, but in the interest of not gettin' eaten I think I'll let ye make the call.</Description>
