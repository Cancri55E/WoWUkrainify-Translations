  <Title>Aggressive Mating Strategy</Title>
  <Description>Aggression is good. I agree with Jangalar that Ben'jin needs to be a lot less passive to succeed and I can prove science is the way to do it by making an injection for him.$b$bAlchemy tells us that, for this type of beast, aggression comes from a substance in their bile sacs. The local razorwings are invasive and, as such, have more than enough aggression for our purposes. $b$bHarvest some of their bile sacs and I'll make a treatment that will have our big boy ready to go again in no time.</Description>
