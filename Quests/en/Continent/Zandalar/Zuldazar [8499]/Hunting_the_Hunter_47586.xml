  <Title>Hunting the Hunter</Title>
  <Description>Your hunter king, Nesingwary, is a mighty fine bit of prey here. I even thought of hunting him myself.

But someone else is on his trail now. And dat hunter, he is a dangerous one.

If you wish to save your hunter king, you best start tracking quickly. If he made camp, you may be too late already. You cannot paint a target and wonder why you were shot!

I believe he was last seen heading west...</Description>
