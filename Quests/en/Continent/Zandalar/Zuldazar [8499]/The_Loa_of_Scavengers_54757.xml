  <Title>The Loa of Scavengers</Title>
  <Description>Richmon, you bring me many shiny things. You helped some of those that no one else would. And ya dumb enough to keep comin' back to me trash piles.

I like ya style.

Now for da big one. Go to the steps of Dazar'alor, and find the Chronicler Ash'tari. Her chisel makes da shrines there. Tell her to build me a shrine and I will grant you my boon.

Unlike the flappy Pa'ku or running Gonk, I just gonna let ya scrap your trash in my pile and I'll give ya stuff back. Anywhere my trash piles be.</Description>
