  <Title>Featherfeet's Fun Falling's Fun Fee!</Title>
  <Description>Welcome to Zuldazar, my fine $pr friend!

I've explored every inch of this wonderful city with my own two feet. And let me tell you, they're tired!

That's why I've decided to provide a service to my powerful friends in the Horde: Featherfeet's Fun Falling!

Now, I know what you're thinking. You nomrally associate falling with screams, pain, and an untimely death.

BUT NOT WITH FEATHERFEET!

For a small one-time fee, I'll make sure you always float down this ziggurat shrouded in safety and fun.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Pay 100 gold to Quinsy Featherfeet and he'll cast Slow Fall on you whenever you're nearby.</LogDescription>
