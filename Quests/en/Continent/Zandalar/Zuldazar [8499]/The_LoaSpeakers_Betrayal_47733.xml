  <Title>The Loa-Speaker's Betrayal</Title>
  <Description>Listen, stranger. I don't have a lot of time left.

I was in de village when Zolani brought de king to us. Said to keep it a secret, or else Zul would find us.

Look around. Dey found us!

But I know... I know it was not de prophet's doing. Our loa-speaker gave Zolani her pretty words, said she would help, then turned around and sold us out.

It is Kihara's fault dat we are dying now. She brought dis upon us!

Kill her... Make her pay!</Description>
