  <Title>Plot Twist</Title>
  <Description>It is time to end Vol'jamba.

I want to make one thing clear. He can still kill you. Your fate, moreso than mine, hangs on your ability to fight dis former student of mine.

He will bring masks, and voodoo, and he will do everything within his power to end you. All we have done is taken away his ability to cheat.

Good luck. For your sake, I hope you do not fail.</Description>
