  <Title>Scrying for the Eye</Title>
  <Description>On behalf of the Horde we seek a relic called the Eye of Xibala.

The locals have been no help whatsoever and Miss Tae'shara insists that we use her survey equipment.

I abhor guesswork. Instead we shall use a more direct method: scrying.

I will mark three locations on your map. I would like you to place a scrying vessel at each of them. I will use their measurements to isolate the relic's location and we will be on our way.</Description>
