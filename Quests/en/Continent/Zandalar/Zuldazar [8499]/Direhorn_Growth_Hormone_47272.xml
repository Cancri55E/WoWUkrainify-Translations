  <Title>Direhorn Growth Hormone</Title>
  <Description>Nice little critter you got there. Seems a tad too small to be much more than a nuisance though. 

Wanna help a friend make a profit? There's an abundance of opportunity here, but these trolls won't listen to me!

Tell you what, I can make a supplement of sorts that'll make hair grow on your chest! Er, your hatchling's chest! 

I know direhorn are vegetarians and all, but there's a reason all the biggest predators eat meat!

Rapid growth requires protein. LOTS of protein.
