  <Title>Morgrum's Survey</Title>
  <Description>Oi. Since yer hands are already dirty, what do ye say we make a deal?

To give it to ye straight, there's a relic here called the Breath of Xibala. I don't know who Xibala is or why the Alliance wants its breath, but there's a hefty sum of gold in it fer me if we deliver.

That means there's somethin' in it for you, too, if ye get my meanin'.

I started a survey with me equipment but haven't got me results yet. Go on out into the ruins an' give the boxes you see a little kick to hurry things along.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Check on Excavator Morgrum Emberflint's survey equipment in the Ruins of Xibala.</LogDescription>
