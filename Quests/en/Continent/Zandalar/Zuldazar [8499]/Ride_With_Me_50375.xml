  <Title>Ride With Me</Title>
  <Description>I have hunted many powerful foes, $p. My pack has defended this island and its people from countless outside threats and foreign invaders.

But there is a darkness growing in Zandalar. A corruption so deep and relentless that it consumes the minds of the Zandalari.

I cannot hunt intangible darkness, but I can hunt those who wield it against my people.

Come, ride with me and my pack. I smell the foul stench of blood trolls nearby. We will see how well you hunt with the pack.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ride Gonk as he investigates the source of corruption nearby.</LogDescription>
