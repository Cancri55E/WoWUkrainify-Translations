I overheard the ordeal that Pa'ku has laid at your feet. I can help you.

I oversee this roost at my loa's pleasure. I have seen many eggs become glorious beasts of war. It will be a long road ahead, with many trials to overcome, but de companionship of a pterrordax be a worthy reward.

For now, de little one is young. Simply tend to his needs while he stays in de nest. When he is ready to take on de world he will let you know.

Good luck, $n.</Description>
