  <Title>Word from the Deep</Title>
  <Description>A dark soul has infiltrated the Zanchuli Council, seeking an accord with Queen Azshara.

Some followed, through greed or fear. Others were too trusting and believed his lies.

We fall, one by one. They will soon clear the path of resistance.

Azshara's motives are hidden behind a vast darkness. She reaches into a place from where she cannot return.

I would pity her, but she killed my followers...

When the time comes, I will rip her apart.</Description>
