  <Title>The Things They Carried</Title>
  <Description>We need to know more about these sailors before we report back.

Ideally, we would invade their camp but there are too many for our small group to take on. Lucky for us, they are focused on their salvage operation over safety. See if you can find any intelligence on their leaders who are scavenging the derelicts.</Description>
