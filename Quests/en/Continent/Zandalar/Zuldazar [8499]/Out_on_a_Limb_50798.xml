  <Title>Out on a Limb</Title>
  <Description>Ah, there you are.

Kua'fon ran off into de jungle. I saw him head down de western path out of the Kraal but beyond that I could not say where he may have gone.

This kind of thing happens with the young. Our winged companions have a keen sense of adventure!

It would be helpful if yours could fly, but it is not yet time. I would check any reasonably high place that he could climb to, as a start.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find and rescue Kua'fon in the Slough.</LogDescription>
