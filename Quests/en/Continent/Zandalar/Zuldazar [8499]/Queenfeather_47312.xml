  <Title>Queenfeather</Title>
  <Description>Ah, so you are de one who inherited Bazkoji's herd. What is left of it, anyway.

I know what killed him, and I tried to warn him. Queenfeather is a vicious ravasaur, bigger than de rest and smarter as well. Most of de eggs around here are hers.

Usually I praise de strength of such a beast, but she has become a nuisance.

You will find her guarding her nests in de feeding grounds. Kill her and bring back one of her head feathers as proof dat de deed is done.</Description>
