  <Title>The Scrolls of Gral</Title>
  <Description>These gilblins are ridiculous! They are like a swarm of angry bees, buzzing around.

Hmm, maybe not bees. Bees are useful, and make honey, and don't steal things.

They ransacked our scrolls. Most were unusable, but there were three that are quite... potent. 

It would be most unfortunate if those made it back to their masters, the naga. Please clean up their mess and bring back our scrolls.</Description>
