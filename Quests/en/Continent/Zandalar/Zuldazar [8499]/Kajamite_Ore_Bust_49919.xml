  <Title>Kaja'mite Ore Bust</Title>
  <Description>Kaja'mite! Just saying the name gives my big beautiful ears a buzz. 

These Zandalari were sitting on a huge deposit of it all these years. And they abandoned it just because of a few talking gorillas. By goblin law it's ours for the taking!

Let's see how concentrated a deposit we're talking about. Get a good peek at those vents that are steaming out kaja'mite vapors.

Go into the gorge and plant my scanners on those steam vents. They'll do the rest.</Description>
