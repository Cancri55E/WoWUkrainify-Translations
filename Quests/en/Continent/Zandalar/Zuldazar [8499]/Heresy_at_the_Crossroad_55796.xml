  <Title>Heresy at the Crossroad</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Torcali's voice enters your mind.&gt;

My followers undertook a pilgrimage to a place called the Antul'Mita Plateau. It is regarded as the crossroads of Zandalar among my faithful and is the site of a Greater Wayshrine.

I sense some great peril has fallen upon them.

I have sent my children and my champion, Jo'nok, to their aid. Your charge is among them. Go to her and ensure that my acolytes reach the shrine safely.

Let nothing stand in your way.</Description>
