  <Title>I Spy a Spire</Title>
  <Description>It is good you have come. Dol'watha be under attack by these snake-men.

Soon as they arrived they started pulling these weird spire-things out de ground. I seen a bunch of snake-mons with feathers in their caps getting zapped by them, but they not be dying.

If it not be bad for them, that means it's good for them. And that be bad for us.

Destroy those spires. Hopefully whatever boon they be getting will go away and they will be easier to kill.</Description>
