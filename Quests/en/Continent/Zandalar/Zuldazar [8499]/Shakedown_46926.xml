  <Description>Where are de guards? 

Princess Talanji has convinced King Rastakhan to permit outsiders in our port. For de first time in centuries, we have allowed non-trolls to set foot on our shores and peddle their wares.

And now trolls of lesser tribes seem to think dey can take advantage of these merchants?

I will not allow dis sort of behavior. While I investigate why de merchants are not protected, I want you to work your way through de bazaar and slay any thugs you find.
