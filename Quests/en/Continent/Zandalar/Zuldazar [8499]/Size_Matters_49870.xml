  <Title>Size Matters</Title>
  <Description>So the unintended side-effect of Gentle Ben'jin being, shall we say 'fun-sized' is that he is now small enough to get into the cave where the alpha wind serpent is! $b$bThe beast is called Gloomtail and if Ben'jin defeats it, he will feel like this territory is his and will want to fill it with little brutosaurs. So he will seek out a mate. If Maka'fon is receptive, everyone wins! $b$bGo give him another hit of the formula!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Administer the 'voodoo'-ed Aggression Formula to Ben'jin.</LogDescription>
