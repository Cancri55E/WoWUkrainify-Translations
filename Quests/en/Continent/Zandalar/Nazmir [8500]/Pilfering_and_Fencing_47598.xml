  <Title>Pilfering and Fencing</Title>
  <Description>Our ships are sunk. Our A.M.O.D.'s gone. We've lost a LOT on this mission... and the Bilgewater Cartel don't offer insurance. The debt collectors will be all over us! We gotta make up for these losses. 

The beach is swarmin' with naga tryin' to collect artifacts from the ruins. How 'bout we grab some of that treasure and make back our money? I'm sure we could find a buyer willing to take 'em off our hands. 

We'll split the proceeds 80/20. Sounds fair to me.</Description>
