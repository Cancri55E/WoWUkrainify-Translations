  <Title>Blood Purification</Title>
  <Description>&lt;You see a strange blood orb that emanates whispers of suffering and destruction.

These must be the source of energy for whatever corruption Hezrel is hunting. They appear easy enough to destroy.

You can see more of these orbs around the temple grounds. Perhaps destroying them will help to weaken the corruption in the area.&gt;</Description>
