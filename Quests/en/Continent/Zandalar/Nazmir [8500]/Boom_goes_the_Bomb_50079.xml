  <Description>Just look at 'em... those blood trolls are holed up pretty good down there in that fortress of theirs. Multiple defensive lines, lots of equipment, they got everything.

They're completely unprepared for us! I almost feel sorry for 'em!

Let's start off by showing 'em what we think of their cute attempts at making barricades. Here, take these smoke grenades and put a signal right on top of them. We'll see how well they hold up to high explosives!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Call artillery strikes on the Blood Troll Barricades in Zul'Nazman.</LogDescription>
