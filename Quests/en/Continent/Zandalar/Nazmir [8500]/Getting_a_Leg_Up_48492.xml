  <Title>Getting a Leg Up</Title>
  <Description>I seem to be in a bit of a... predicament.

My squad was scouting on behalf of Lady Sylvanas when we were ambushed by some snake men calling themselves "sethrak".

As you can see, my legs have been separated from my body in the ambush. It's just a flesh wound, luckily.

Care to help me get re-attached? Then we can get down to this business of vengeance against these sethrak.</Description>
