  <Title>Field Evaluation</Title>
  <Description>We got the A.M.O.D. back together. It's a fine piece of equipment, but we're gonna have to give it a tune up. We don't want to end up digging shrapnel out of our rears.

Lucky for us, there are a few naga camps remaining along with the giant that broke the gun in the first place. They'll be great for target practice.

We'll deploy the A.M.O.D. just outside the building here. After we deploy, go man it. I'll have you fire a few rounds while I tune its gun.

Everything'll be fine... unless it isn't.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the A.M.O.D. to destroy the naga camps and defeat Grobathan.</LogDescription>
