  <Title>WANTED: Tojek</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The tattered paper appears to include a list of known threats in the area.

The top of the list reads: "Tojek - Direhorn - Responsible for damages to 3 vehicles, 6 supply crates, and the tragic loss of Garrick Blacksteel's mole machine, avoid at all costs."

Perhaps you can hunt down this creature to prevent further attacks.&gt;</Description>
