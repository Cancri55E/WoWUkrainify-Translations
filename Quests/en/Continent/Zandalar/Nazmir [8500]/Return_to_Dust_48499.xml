  <Description>It appears the sethrak are quite serious about keeping this gem. I do wonder where they found it in the first place.

Hrm... perhaps Lady Sylvanas would be interested in this as well. Something to ponder.

Ingrid believes this gem can unleash lightning and shadow magic of, her words not mine, epic proportions.

I do believe it would be best for everyone if you tested it out on the small sethrak army currently looking for us.</Description>
