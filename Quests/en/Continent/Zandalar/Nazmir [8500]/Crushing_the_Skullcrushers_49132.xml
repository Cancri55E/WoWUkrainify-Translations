  <Title>Crushing the Skullcrushers</Title>
  <Description>Look, $n, I'll be happy once we've killed this herald and we can have things go back to normal.

Until then, you need to deal with these monstrous blood trolls called "skullcrushers". Lovely, right?

As far as I can tell, these things have some sort of connection to this herald, might be why they're so huge.

You kill these skullcrushers and maybe we weaken this herald a bit more. Or maybe it gets even angrier and kills us all. 

We'll have to see.</Description>
