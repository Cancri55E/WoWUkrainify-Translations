  <Title>Killing Cannibals</Title>
  <Description>Shoak and I have had a few run-ins with the Natha'vor trolls. Must be why they wanted to capture that idiot.

The women in that tribe actually eat the men... and anyone else they can get their hands on. I'm sure they're getting ready to eat Shoak.

Do us all a favor and kill some of those cannibals. The world would be a better place without them.</Description>
