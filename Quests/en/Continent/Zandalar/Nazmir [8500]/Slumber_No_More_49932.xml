  <Title>Slumber No More</Title>
  <Description>There's something you should look into. You've got the time anyway, those goblins aren't ready yet.

There's a statue nearby. Only, it's not a statue to the trained tortollan eye. It's a deactivated titan keeper!

Noises have been coming from that thing ever since you helped Krag'wa. It must be trying to reactivate itself.

I bet that titan-looking amulet of yours could help restart it. We'd be unstoppable against the blood trolls with a titan keeper's help.

Go see if you can restart this titan!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Examine the deactivated titan keeper outside of Gloom Hollow.</LogDescription>
