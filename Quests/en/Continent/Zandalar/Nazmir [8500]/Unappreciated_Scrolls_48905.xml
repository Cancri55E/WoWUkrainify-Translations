  <Title>Unappreciated Scrolls</Title>
  <Description>Since you're here in Natha'vor, you might as well help out the rest of the pilgrimage with a problem.

These trolls have stolen several of our scrolls. Why they would, I have no idea, I doubt they're smart enough to even read.

I want you to get them back. I'm not young anymore, I can't just be casting magic off the top of my head! 

Especially healing magic... which I'm sure Shoak is going to need when you rescue his dumb shell.</Description>
