  <Description>I'm feeling... stronger! But I need more power before we take down Urok.

No, Sur'jan, YOU are scared of Urok more than me. I'm not scared of nothing!

You got an attachment to me now after dat ritual. I need you to go kill de skyterrors nearby. Their deaths will fuel my strength.

Take my grappling hook. You can drag de skyterrors down from de sky with it, and it'll put de hurt on dem too.</Description>
