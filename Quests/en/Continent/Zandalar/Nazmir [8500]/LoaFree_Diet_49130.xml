  <Description>Princess Talanji thinks we're almost ready to kill this herald of G'huun. Maybe she's right, maybe we're all dead, who knows?

What I do know is the blood trolls here are... are carving and carrying away parts of Torga. Ugh!

From what I can tell, they're using poor Torga's meat to power their blood rituals. This has to stop!

Go out there and steal those pieces of meat from the blood trolls. I'll figure out a way to dispose of it.</Description>
