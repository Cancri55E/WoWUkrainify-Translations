  <Description>These things called the sethrak think that we're easily handled. That's only because we were ambushed and not ready for a fight.

Well, all right, perhaps we were easily handled. But that doesn't mean we won't strike back.

Kill as many of those sethrak as you can. I don't know who they are or what they want, but I do know one thing.

They signed their death warrants when they attacked my squad and cut me in half.</Description>
