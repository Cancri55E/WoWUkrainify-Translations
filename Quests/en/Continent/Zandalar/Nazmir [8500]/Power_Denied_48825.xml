  <Title>Power Denied</Title>
  <Description>Ah! Oh, it's you, $n. Zardrax has me on edge, saying we are all doomed, dat dere is no hope.

I had a plan to stop him. All we had to do was kill a hexxer, Nana'kwug, who is helping spread Zardrax's power, and steal de fetish she is using.

Den you'd give dat fetish to Da'jul and he'd use his voodoo to grant us more power.

But it is hopeless now. Maybe we should just side with Zardrax. How can we stop someting as big as dis?</Description>
