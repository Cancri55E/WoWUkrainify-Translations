  <Title>Shoak's on the Menu</Title>
  <Description>I don't know what stupid thing Shoak did to get captured by the Natha'vor trolls, we'll find out once you rescue him.

I bet they're getting ready to make a meal out of Shoak. You need to work fast and get him out! 

Shoak's one of the largest oafs that I know, those trolls won't be happy that you're taking their "meal" away.</Description>
