  <Title>Recovering Ancient Fire</Title>
  <Description>Zaluto has a crazy plan to kill Zulajin. Never thought a guard could come up with something so clever.

Dere is ancient mojo throughout dis place... who knows what it used to be? But I sense something I can use.

De statues sinking in de tar pits have de fire mojo still burning in dem. We will need it to kill Zulajin.

Take my fetish and use it to absorb what's left of de fire in dese statues.

Just don't get dat fire too close to de tar!</Description>
