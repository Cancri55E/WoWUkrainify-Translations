  <Title>The Last Witch Doctor of Krag'wa</Title>
  <Description>I am Krag'wa, the once mighty. Curse the blood trolls and their dark god! They have slain my worshippers until only Zentimo remained, and now even he is gone.

I want revenge on the blood trolls, but first I must honor the last of my witch doctors. As I have no others, I must request you perform the ritual.

Then we can talk of revenge.</Description>
