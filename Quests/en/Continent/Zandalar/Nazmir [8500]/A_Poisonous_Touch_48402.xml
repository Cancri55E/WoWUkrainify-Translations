  <Title>A Poisonous Touch</Title>
  <Description>You... I saw you speak with Zentimo. Please, I don't have much time left...

These trolls, they came for our blood. I was already nearly bled dry before this one succumbed to my poison.

Search it's body, the blowgun and darts should still be there. Dip the darts into my blood and use them to weaken as many of their number as you can. 

I will not let my death be in vain! If these trolls want our blood so badly, then they shall have it!</Description>
