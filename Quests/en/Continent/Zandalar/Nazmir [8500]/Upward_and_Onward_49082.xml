  <Description>It is sad dat Hir'eek had to die, but at least de blood trolls are weaker now.

My potions are healing me up nicely. I did some looking around and came across dis guy.

He's skittish, but not hostile. I think you can use him to get out of here.

Hurry up and jump on, before he breaks de rope! I'll find my own way out; you don't have to worry.</Description>
