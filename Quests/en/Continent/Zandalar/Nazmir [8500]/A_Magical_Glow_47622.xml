  <Title>A Magical Glow</Title>
  <Description>Long ago when the trolls began listening to the whispering darkness, I instilled portions of my power into the totems that surround my lair. I need that power now.

In the swamps north of here are glowflies. Their magical essence will aid me in drawing the stored power from the totems. Collect them and return. Then you will see what I was capable of at the height of my strength.</Description>
