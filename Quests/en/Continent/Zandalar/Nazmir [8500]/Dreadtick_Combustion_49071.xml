  <Description>This whole thing is crazy, you know that? I don't think any story can top this one...

Bah! Do you hear that insufferable sound?

It's those stupid dreadticks sucking on Torga's meat. Makes my skin crawl! 

What? You can't hear it? Meh, trust me, they're around, and they need to be taken care of.

Here, take this scroll. We've had to deal with these dumb insects in the past. Read it near them and it'll cause them to explode.</Description>
