  <Title>Forcing Fate's Hand</Title>
  <Description>I got some good news and bad news for you about this whole quest to destroy the herald of G'huun. Bad news first.

There's an entire army of skeletons between us and the next area. I'm guessing they used Torga's blood to animate them.

Good news is that scroll you recovered from Holbruk can summon the powerful Hand of Fate.

...and the bad news is that the scroll got damaged when Holbruk died and is only good for one more use.

Meh. Take this scroll and destroy that skeleton army!</Description>
