  <Title>Poisoning the Brood</Title>
  <Description>Now we have room for our plan to kill Hir'eek. You see, $n, my specialty is in making potions and poisons.

I am working on a poison to use on Hir'eek, when de time comes. I have no idea if it will work or not.

I want you to take what I already made and use it on de bats around here. It should kill dem instantly. 

If it works, den I can make it stronger with my voodoo and give us a chance at killing Hir'eek.</Description>
