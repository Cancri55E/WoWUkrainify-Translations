  <Title>Torga's Eternal Return</Title>
  <Description>Well, we did it. Doesn't make the plan we had any less crazy. But there's still one more thing left to do.

I've been visiting Torga for years. He told me stories of powerful scrolls, one in particular that he said was meant to be used to put a loa's spirit to rest.

I think you should be the one to read it. I mean, if you're SMART enough to read it. 

Bah! Just take the scroll and read it before I have second thoughts.</Description>
