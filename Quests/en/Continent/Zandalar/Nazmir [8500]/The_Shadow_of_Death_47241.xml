  <Title>The Shadow of Death</Title>
  <Description>We have four loa, but we only know where one is: Bwonsamdi.

As uncomfortable as it makes me, I am prepared to do anything to stop de blood trolls... even if it means dealing with de loa of death.

Ages ago, Bwonsamdi had a temple here in Nazmir. My scrying has revealed a few locations to de north where I sense a magical presence. Search dem for clues.

Hurry, $n. Zuldazar will fall if we cannot obtain Bwonsamdi's help!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search for clues to the location of the loa, Bwonsamdi.</LogDescription>
