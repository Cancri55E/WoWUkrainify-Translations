  <Title>Fallen Idols</Title>
  <Description>Little creature, please... listen to me. 

I am Krag'wa. 

Once, my worshipers were many and my powers great. Now, my followers are all but gone. What little power I have left was placed within several idols, but the idols have been stolen by the heretical blood trolls.

I ask you, please recover my idols so that I can become whole once more!</Description>
