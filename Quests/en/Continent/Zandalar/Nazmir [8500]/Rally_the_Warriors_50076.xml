  <Title>Rally the Warriors</Title>
  <Description>We have learned so much and came so far thanks to you and de Horde, but all of it will amount to nothing if de blood trolls defeat us here.  

We've all worked hard since we first set foot within dis accursed swamp, without a chance to even get any sleep or have a decent meal. Dey are some of de finest soldiers I've ever encountered, but even dey have their limits.  

Let us remind dem what we are fighting for!</Description>
