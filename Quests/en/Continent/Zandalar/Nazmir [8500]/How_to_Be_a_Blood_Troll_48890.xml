  <Title>How to Be a Blood Troll</Title>
  <Description>You will have to blend in if you don't want anyone getting suspicious. This won't be pretty.

Dere are drudges around de camp who have been tied up as part of a ritual. Dey get beaten as a test to make dem stronger.

Any who fail de ritual are sacrificed. De ones who succeed are allowed to fight de Zandalari.

If you are going to blend in, you need to "test" dese drudges as part of de ritual. It's weird, but dat's how dey work.</Description>
