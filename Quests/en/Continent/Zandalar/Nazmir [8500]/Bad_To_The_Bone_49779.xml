  <Description>I will not leave here without killing Zulajin, or else it will just go after de next caravan dat comes through.

I have a plan, but we must work together to pull it off.

Dere are skeletal raptors roaming in de area. I do not know what voodoo brought dem here, but we need dem gone.

We are going to need as much space as possible for my plan to kill Zulajin.</Description>
