  <Title>There Is No Plan "B"</Title>
  <Description>Look, I'll be honest with you. Our mech, the A.M.O.D., was the best we've ever made. It was mobile. It was powerful. It was one of a kind! 

What I'm trying to say is, without it, our whole plan is ruined! We have to salvage and rebuild it!

That big oaf of a sea giant broke the A.M.O.D. apart and scattered its pieces all over the shore. Find its parts and I'll try to hammer them back together.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate all parts of the A.M.O.D.</LogDescription>
