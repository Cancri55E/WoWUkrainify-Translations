  <Description>Okay, you want to kill the herald of a blood god? We can figure something out.

There's corrupted blood nearby that's feeding this monster's power. Lucky for you, I've heard stories of this sort of thing before.

Take this scroll, but be careful with it! It'll destroy the corrupted blood that's feeding Jungo.

Oh, and I need you to find a scroll Holbruk was carrying, called the Scroll of Fate's Hand. It's REALLY powerful. We'll need it.</Description>
