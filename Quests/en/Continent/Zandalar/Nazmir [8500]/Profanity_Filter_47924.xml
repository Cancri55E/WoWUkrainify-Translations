  <Description>I hate this place! I just want to go home, but I can't because that oaf, Shoak, is missing.

Listen, $rt, I'll make it worth your while if you help me find that dunce.

I've got a way to find Shoak, but of COURSE these stupid totems are blocking my magic! Why wouldn't they?

Take this scroll and use its magic to burn these totems. I'm going to look around to see if that bonehead is just sleeping somewhere.</Description>
