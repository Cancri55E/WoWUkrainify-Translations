  <Description>Of course the Natha'vor trolls have Shoak! Why would it be easy?

I'm sick and tired of running from these trolls. That's why you're going in to end this.

The Natha'vor trolls have three powerful troll witch doctors called "corpse mongers". Take them out and you'll send the tribe into disarray.

Of course, this could all fail spectacularly and make my terrible day even worse.</Description>
