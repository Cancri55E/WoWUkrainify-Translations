  <Title>Isolating Zalamar</Title>
  <Description>Hir'eek, de loa of bats, has been corrupted by G'huun! We will get no help from him.

We only have one option if dey have a loa on their side... we must kill Hir'eek.

It's crazy, and we will both probably die, but I have a plan. We need to isolate dis place first.

De blood trolls have wardrummers who sound an alarm if anything happens here. We need dem gone... but you have to be sneaky about it.

You have a good disguise, so you can order de drummers to go leave their posts.</Description>
