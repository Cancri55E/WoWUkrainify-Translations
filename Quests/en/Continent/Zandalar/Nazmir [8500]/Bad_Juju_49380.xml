  <Description>Look, between you and me, dere is no way we will drag my friend outta here without what got us into dis mess.

We saw three orbs in dis camp. Dey are filled with de power of blood magic and are used in dirty rituals. 

Blood is drained from "volunteers" to corrupt de tadpoles of Krag'wa into vicious crawgs.

If dis is a possible fate for children of loa, we must end it. 

Take dis vial and bleed de orbs dry. De chronicler will need to do research.</Description>
