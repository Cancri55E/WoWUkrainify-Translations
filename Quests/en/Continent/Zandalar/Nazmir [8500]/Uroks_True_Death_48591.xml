  <Title>Urok's True Death</Title>
  <Description>This is it! My power is back; we are ready to put down Urok. He used to be a noble beast, you know. Big, strong.

Now Urok is just a mindless undead. It isn't right. We'll put him to rest.

I'm going to run up ahead. When you get near Urok, I'll hop out to ambush him. Let's do dis!

Shut up, Sur'jan. Of course we're going to win! If we don't, I'll just find another $c to help me out.</Description>
