  <Title>No Mercy for Sithis</Title>
  <Description>Heh heh... thanks for the rescue! I could use your help in a little plan that I have.

The commander of this place is a sethrak called Sithis. He's got this thing called a "skycaller gem."

Word is they're looking for some sort of shadow magic in Nazmir to try and really power this thing up.

Heh heh... luckily, yours truly has her own shadow magic to do just that! Maybe you do, too. I don't keep up on what powers you keep getting.

Get the gem from Sithis and we'll have some REAL fun afterwards.</Description>
