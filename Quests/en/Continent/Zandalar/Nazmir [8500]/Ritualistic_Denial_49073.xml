  <Title>Ritualistic Denial</Title>
  <Description>I can't believe we're dealing with a death loa, a DEAD loa, and blood trolls. This isn't what I had planned today!

Look, some of the other tortollans have said there are some blood rituals going on. They were spooked and started heading for the coast when they saw it.

Take this scroll and read it near any blood rituals. It should cause it to disperse.

Be careful with my scroll! It's old and they don't make them like they used to.</Description>
