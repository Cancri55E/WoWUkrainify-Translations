  <Title>Reuniting the Company</Title>
  <Description>Right, then. First order of business, rescue the remnants of my company. 

These sethrak kept yelling about expanding their empire and conquering Azeroth as they attacked us. Lovely, really.

They killed most of my company and took some hostages. I assume they're being told how grand the sethrak empire is.

I'd like the remnants of my company back, if you please. I'll put in a good word with Lady Sylvanas, once this is all over. 

...not that someone like you needs it.</Description>
