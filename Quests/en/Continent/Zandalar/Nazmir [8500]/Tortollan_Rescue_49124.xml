  <Title>Tortollan Rescue</Title>
  <Description>If Torga wants us to help you kill the herald of G'huun, then I guess we'll help. First, we need to rescue our people.

I found out that the blood trolls are draining the blood of our friends nearby and then feeding them to crawgs! 

This is no way for a tortollan to die, not after hundred of years gathering stories on Azeroth. 

Take this scroll. It'll purge whatever blood magic the blood trolls using on my friends.

Be careful with my scroll! I want it back in one piece.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rescue $1oa Tortollan Captives from the blood trolls using Lashk's Scroll of Purging.</LogDescription>
