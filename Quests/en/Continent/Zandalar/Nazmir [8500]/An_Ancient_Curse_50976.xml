  <Title>An Ancient Curse</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The harsh conditions of Nazmir have not been kind to the stone tablet.

Most of the inscriptions have been worn away but you are able to make out a picture that shows a chest surrounded by glyphs. Above the chest you noticed what appears to be a large floating skull.

Below the images you find a single word "Aiji".

The ruins ahead seem foreboding, and you may want to bring some friends to help you.
With their help, perhaps you can find the secret of this "Aiji" and its treasure within.&gt;</Description>
