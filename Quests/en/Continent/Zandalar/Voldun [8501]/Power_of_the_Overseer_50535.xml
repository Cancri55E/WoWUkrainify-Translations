  <Title>Power of the Overseer</Title>
  <Description>Overseer Nerzet is very cruel, and oh so easy to provoke!  

It makes her very angry when things go missing, or move, or change... my crew and I are having a yip of a time! That you got this device to work was certainly a bonus!

It will be much easier for us to finish up what we need to do here, with her out of the way. 

Um, and maybe go ahead and grab that neat power rock she carries. It could come in handy.</Description>
