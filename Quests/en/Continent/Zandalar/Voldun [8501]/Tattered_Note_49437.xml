  <Title>Tattered Note</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The short, hand-written note is scrawled in blood.&gt;

They captured me soon after I was exiled. I was too weak to be a slave and too starved to be food for the beasts.

They were going to kill me, but one called Shath'kar intervened. He said it would be amusing to watch me starve to death among his prisoners.

I have not lived a good life. I deserve nothing. But, to any fellow Zandalari who finds this, I have one request...

Stick a blade in Shath'kar's belly and twist it until the snake is dead!</Description>
