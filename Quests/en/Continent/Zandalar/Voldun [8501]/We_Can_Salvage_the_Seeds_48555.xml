  <Title>We Can Salvage the Seeds</Title>
  <Description>I've studied the flora within the terrace extensively. Once a thistlevine completely dries out, it's too late for the plant to be saved. 

Its seeds are still viable, however. Under the right conditions, they can be used to cultivate new, healthy thistlevines. 

Salvage seeds from the carnivorous thistlevines that can no longer be saved, and plant them within the fertile mounds of dirt. 

The thistlevine plant is extremely quick to sprout, so the terrace should be filled with seedlings in no time!</Description>
