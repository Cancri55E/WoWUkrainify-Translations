  <Description>I do not understand why the naga would bother attacking a small fishing village.

Why waste their time on our simple tribe? The naga seek power and we have none. It makes no sense!

They must be after something else entirely...

Search Darkwood Shoal and learn of their plans. Whatever the naga are after, it must be quite powerful.

Perhaps if we find it first, we can use it against them!</Description>
