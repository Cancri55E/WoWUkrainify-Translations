  <Title>Secrets in the Sand</Title>
  <Description>I found this journal buried in the sand. 

Kiro tried to toss it in the fire.

"Our wagon has no space for a diary, Meerah. What practical use does it have?"

Quite a few pages are missing, but I bet you can recover them out on the dunes!</Description>
