  <Description>One thing I've learned during my time in Vol'dun is to not stay in one place for too long. And doubly so when the Faithless are involved.

We've done our damage here. Let's move before we get caught.

I procured a mount to take us back to Meerah and the others in Vorrik's Sanctum quickly. Don't worry, this Faithless won't be needing it anymore.</Description>
