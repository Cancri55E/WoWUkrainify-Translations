  <Title>Lost in Zem'lan</Title>
  <Description>Legends say that a mountain of treasure sits deep inside the Port of Zem'lan, pillaged from every corner of Azeroth. But it's guarded by unkillable, eternal monsters.

No vulpera or exile has ever stolen treasure from the Port of Zem'lan and made it out alive.

My caravan was going to be the first. Our scout, Meeki snuck in to figure out a route, but he never came back.

It would be wisest for you to leave here and never return. But, if you go into the port, please find Meeki.</Description>
