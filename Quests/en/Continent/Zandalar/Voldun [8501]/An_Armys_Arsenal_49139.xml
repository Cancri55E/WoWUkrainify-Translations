  <Title>An Army's Arsenal</Title>
  <Description>It's my job to scout out the ruins to identify threats and figure out the best way in.

Two storehouses contain the majority of the valuable weaponry in the ruins.

Unfortunately, they're guarded by specters, powerful Zandalari spirits bound to this place.

I... we need those weapons. Take out the specters so I... we can get to them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill the specters of Mugabu and Jam'jen, so Omi can ransack the storehouses.</LogDescription>
