  <Title>They Came From The Sea</Title>
  <Description>You are free to rest your weary legs in our camp, but I'm afraid we have little more to offer you.

Naga have driven us from our village by the sea. We can no longer fish or hunt crabs. I fear we may not survive long if we cannot take back our lagoon.

But taking back the lagoon will not be enough. We must find out why the naga attacked us. What is it they are looking for?

Take this ancient scroll and use it summon the spirits of the naga.

They will only speak truth while under its spell.</Description>
