  <Title>Savage Saurolisks</Title>
  <Description>Please, help me! I'm trapped in dis box and I can't make it out alone!

I came here to collect eggs. I knew it was a bad idea, but I thought I could sneak around and grab de eggs before de saurolisks noticed.

I was wrong...

I hid underneath dis crate to avoid being eaten!

Can you clear out de saurolisks and tell me when it's safe to come out?

Please, don't leave me here!</Description>
