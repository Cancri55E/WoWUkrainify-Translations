  <Title>Informing the Horde</Title>
  <Description>General Jakra'zet has been defeated, but his plan to summon Mythrax succeeded despite our best efforts.

Were it not for the mercy of Sethraliss, I doubt we would have made it out of Atul'Aman alive.

We must inform our allies of what has transpired in Vol'dun.

I'll speak with princess Talanji myself. You should go and speak with the Horde. We need all the help we can get now.

I'm sure our paths will cross again, $n. It was an honor fighting with you.</Description>
