  <Title>Plans for Attack</Title>
  <Description>Before we were attacked, I had a plan to take the fight to the sethrak. 

It was devised with flawless intel. I know, because I gathered the information myself. 

I surveyed their entire compound and created a map based on my findings. 

My plan relies on that map, but it's now in the hands of Fangcaller Sraka, the brute who's leading this assault on my home.

Help me kill her so I can take back what's mine!</Description>
