  <Title>Vol'duni Fried Chicken</Title>
  <Description>Have you ever tried my delicious Vol'duni fried chicken?

Me neither! Probably because dere aren't any chickens in Vol'dun.

Dere are plenty of vultures, though. Why don't you see if you can find some tasty vulture meat?

De secret to delicious fried chicken is to roast de meat before you fry it, but it only works if de meat is fresh.

I've soaked dese arrows in alpaca fat. If you ignite de arrows and shoot down de birds, dey'll start cooking before dey're even dead!</Description>
