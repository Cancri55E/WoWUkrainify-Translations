  <Title>A Meal for Birds</Title>
  <Description>I don't know why I agreed to this. We weren't supposed to be scavenging. 

Kiro gave me specific instructions to head to the basin and feed the buzzards.

I can't go back to camp until they eat, but I'm not heading into that basin while the sethrak are still swarming. 

Have you ever fed a buzzard? It's easy, I promise. 

You kill it, they eat it. That simple.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill wildlife within The Brine Basin so Mekaru's buzzards can eat.</LogDescription>
