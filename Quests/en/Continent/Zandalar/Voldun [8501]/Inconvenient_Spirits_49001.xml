  <Title>Inconvenient Spirits</Title>
  <Description>The sethrak have oppressed vulpera like me for countless generations.

You can't fight 'em. Trust me, $pr. My caravan tried.

I took that beating as a lesson, and then I found a new pack to run with.

Here, we keep our distance from the sethrak and scavenge ruins like this one for anything valuable we can use or trade.

You want in? We could use a fourth. This one's protected by nasty spirits that keep harassing us.

Take them out and you're in.</Description>
