  <Title>Rescue the Relics</Title>
  <Description>According to the information you brought us, we should be adding those relics to our collection.

Explore the ruins and see if you can find any of these "tokens of affection" the sethrak may have left for their Keepers. 

Better we find hands that will cherish them, than ones that will destroy.

Plus, add a little time, and anything becomes interesting... to the right people.</Description>
