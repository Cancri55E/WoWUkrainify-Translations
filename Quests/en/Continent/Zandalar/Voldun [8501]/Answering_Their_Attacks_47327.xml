  <Title>Answering Their Attacks</Title>
  <Description>The sethrak's attacks on our burrows cannot go unanswered. 

They need to learn that not all within the desert will give up so easily. 

The only thing the sethrak understand is blood, so that's the language we'll use to teach them.

&lt;Nisha pauses and looks at you, skeptical that you understood her.&gt;

I'm saying we need to kill the sethrak here. All of them.</Description>
