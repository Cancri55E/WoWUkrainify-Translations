  <Title>Zandalari Treasure Trove</Title>
  <Description>We've looted some quality goods already, but the real reward is still ahead. The big chamber in the back of the ruins is filled with powerful artifacts.

A treasure trove like that is the sort of thing that can save lives and sell for a fortune out here in Vol'dun.

But those specters you killed weren't lying. Their master or king or whatever is very well-protected in there.

We'll have to take this one down as a group. Let me know when you're ready to head up to the chamber.</Description>
