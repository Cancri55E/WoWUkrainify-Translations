  <Title>Ranishu Are Resources</Title>
  <Description>We can't afford to waste resources out here.

Over time, we've learned to take anything that looks even remotely useful, and be creative using what we have. I've turned a skull into a boat and a sethrak into a tent flap.

I can't spit dust when it comes to magic, but I can mix poisons and potions with the best of 'em.

Ranishu stomach acid makes wicked poison, but it's nasty to collect. Don't try to bottle it. Just bring me their stomachs whole and intact. No leaks!</Description>
