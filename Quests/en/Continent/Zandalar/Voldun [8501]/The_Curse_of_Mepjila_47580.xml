  <Title>The Curse of Mepjila</Title>
  <Description>Centuries ago, the sea witch Mepjila attacked my temple with an army of naga invaders.

My followers fought bravely, but I arrived too late to save them.

I defeated the naga army with ease. But as I closed my jaws around Mepjila, she placed a curse upon the spirits of my followers, locking them in an eternal battle they can never win.

This mask will give you the power to enter the spirit realm and end their nightmare.

Defeat the spirit of Mepjila and the curse will be broken.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat the spirit of Mepjila.</LogDescription>
