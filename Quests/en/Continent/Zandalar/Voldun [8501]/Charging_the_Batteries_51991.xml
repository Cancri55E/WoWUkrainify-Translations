  <Title>Charging the Batteries</Title>
  <Description>These little fellas are ravenous whirlwinds of devouring destruction. When they get going, they consume anything in their path, without even stopping! When sated, they discharge power from them little 'lectric zingers on their heads! 

Then they nap.

Lucky for us, we found just the right frequency to control their tiny bug brains. Hit that device, and you can take your own little zapper out for a spin... literally!

Make sure ya bring it back full, so we can keep our rigs charged!</Description>
