  <Title>A Strange Delivery</Title>
  <Description>The last time our caravan rolled through the Whistlebloom Oasis, we found an odd Zandalari living in a cave. We traded a few things and he paid me upfront to bring him a pineapple. I don't know why.

It took me a long time to find one, but a vulpera holds up her end of the trade.

I was planning to stop by and drop it off after we finished here. But, thanks to your help, we've got a lot more treasure hunting to do here at the port.

If you have time, would you deliver it for me?</Description>
