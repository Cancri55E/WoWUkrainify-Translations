  <Title>Freshly Squeezed</Title>
  <Description>Is this troll a friend of yours? I'm so glad Kiro let me keep her. 

He's a bit wary of outsiders, but he's a great healer. 

She'll wake up, I promise. And when she does, she'll be thirsty.

The sands are short on water, but you're in luck. The grove that surrounds this camp is filled with pricklevines. 

You wouldn't want to eat the flesh, but the liquid inside can quench any thirst.

Just give them a good squeeze to collect their juice.</Description>
