  <Title>The Missing Key</Title>
  <Description>Korthek has grown spiteful and arrogant over the years, but I realize now that he has grown mad as well.

Mythrax will kill all of us if he is released.

For too long, I've held out hope that I could convince Korthek peacefully to abandon his heresy. I was wrong.

All of Zandalar is at risk while Korthek and his allies hold even one key to Mythrax's prison.

Meet me outside his fortress in the north. We will confront my old friend "Emperor" Korthek and end this together.</Description>
