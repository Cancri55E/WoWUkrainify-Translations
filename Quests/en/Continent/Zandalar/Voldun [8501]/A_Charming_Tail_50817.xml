  <Title>A Charming Tail</Title>
  <Description>I think they would make great guardians, when they get older... with the proper training.

However, it seems some of my trainees have wandered off. There are so many things nearby that could harm them!

Between the walking sandstorms and angry plants... it's been safer to hide out here and look at night.

I'm so exhausted! 

Could you take this flute with you and play them a little tune? It will remind them to come back to me.</Description>
