  <Title>Relics of Sethraliss</Title>
  <Description>It may surprise you to learn that the Faithless hoard ancient relics of Sethraliss. I assure you that they do not do so out of reverence or respect, as is proper.

Korthek's brood is driven only by greed and an insatiable lust for power. They rip whatever magic they can from the relics, even if it means destroying them in the process.

Rescue the ancient artifacts of Sethraliss in the Sacred Sands nearby. We will honor and preserve them in the Sanctuary of the Devoted.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover the Skull of the First Skycaller, Rebirth Creed, Sethraliss Sight Stone, and Blood of the Fallen Loa.</LogDescription>
