  <Title>Dressed for Battle</Title>
  <Description>Kiro's the leader of my caravan. He's always been far too passive.

I warned him we needed to make a preemptive strike against the sethrak, but he insisted that we keep our heads down and continue to quietly do business.

Look where that got us.

Our caravan was completely unprepared for their attack. 

Now I'm ready to fight for what's ours, but I'm not exactly dressed for battle.

Help me scavenge some suitable equipment here among our enemies. We will use their own tools against them.</Description>
