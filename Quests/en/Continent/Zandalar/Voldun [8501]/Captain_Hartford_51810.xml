  <Title>Captain Hartford</Title>
  <Description>I'm almost ready to leave Vol'dun once and for all. There's just one thing left to be done...

We need to murder the captain of the ship.

If Captain Hartford finds out I've deserted, I won't be safe in Boralus or anywhere else. He'll hunt me to the Eastern Kingdoms and back if he has to!

This will be dangerous. So you'll want to disguise yourself before boarding The Siren's Call.

This will be our last job together. Do it and I'll give you the code to the captain's lockbox. A pirate's bounty!</Description>
