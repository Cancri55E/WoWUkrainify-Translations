  <Title>If the Key Fits...</Title>
  <Description>These Ashvane are unreasonable. I've tried to bargain for my release, but they refuse any offer I bring to the table. 

All they want is whatever's bubbling up in that mine. My kind know better than to go near that stuff. It's volatile.

There are prisoners in the mine being forced to extract it. Us in the cages? We're back up. When someone dies in the mines, they just send another in. 

If you release me, I'll make sure you're rewarded! We just need to find the right key for this cage...</Description>
