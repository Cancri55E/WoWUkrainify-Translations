  <Title>Alpacas Gone Wild</Title>
  <Description>Our herd of alpacas escaped dis morning. Dey're out dere wandering de dunes as we speak.

Probably for de best, if you ask me. We'll all be dead soon once Mojambo comes back.

Since you seem to care so much, take dis alpaca whistle and use it to round dem up. I blow de whistle every day at feeding time, so de alpacas should come running home when dey hear de sound.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Round up $1oa Alpacas.</LogDescription>
