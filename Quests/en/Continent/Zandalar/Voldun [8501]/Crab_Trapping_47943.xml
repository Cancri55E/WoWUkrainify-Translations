  <Title>Crab Trapping</Title>
  <Description>We are trapped here with little in the way of food and supplies.

The territorial sethrak control the land to the west, and the spiteful naga the waters to the east. We are caught between a barren desert and a hostile ocean.

If you are headed to the lagoon to face the naga, will you bring us back some crabs to eat?

I fear that our tribe will soon perish without food...</Description>
