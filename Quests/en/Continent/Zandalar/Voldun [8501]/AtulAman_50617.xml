  <Description>Jakra'zet and his troops attacked while we were away. 

Serrik fought well, but it wasn't enough. The keys are gone, and it's only a matter of time before the barrier is broken.

Your friends have already given chase. 

Jakra'zet must not be allowed to resurrect Mythrax the Unraveler. He must be stopped before it's too late!

We don't have much time. 

Meet me at Atul'Aman! We must catch up with Kaja and Rakera and stop the ritual!</Description>
