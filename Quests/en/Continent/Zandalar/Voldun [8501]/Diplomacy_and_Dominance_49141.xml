  <Description>May I entrust you with my staff, $p? I do not offer this lightly, so do not accept it lightly either.

We will need every advantage when we face Emperor Korthek, and I've identified an opportunity to increase the power at our disposal.

The Faithless maintain a series of suppression spires on the ridge above us to subjugate the pterrordax. My staff can drain power from the spires to bolster its own potency.

Meanwhile, I will recruit a much-needed ally for the next stage of our mission.</Description>
