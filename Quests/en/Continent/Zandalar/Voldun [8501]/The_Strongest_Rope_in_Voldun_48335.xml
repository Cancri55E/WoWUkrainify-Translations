  <Title>The Strongest Rope in Vol'dun</Title>
  <Description>You ever tried tying up a sethrak with vulture string? Won't hold 'em for long.

When you really gotta keep something, or someone, tied down, you need sandspinner silk.

Thick, pliable, and not as sticky as you'd think.

This isn't a tailoring lesson. Omi's scouting report showed a lot of sandspinners inside the ruin courtyard. Get their silk and bring it back to me.</Description>
