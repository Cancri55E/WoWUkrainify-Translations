  <Title>Stolen Goods</Title>
  <Description>It was brought to my attention recently dat many of our supplies went missing overnight.

I suspected dat Tongo's crew was behind de theft, but we didn't have de strength or numbers needed to confront dem.

I want you to search de hideout for signs of our missing supplies. If dere's anything left when you arrive, bring it back here and I'll make sure you're compensated.

If we're going to survive Mojambo's assault we're going to need those stolen supplies back as soon as possible.</Description>
