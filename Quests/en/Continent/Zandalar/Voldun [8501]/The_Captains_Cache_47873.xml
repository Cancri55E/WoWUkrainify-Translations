  <Title>The Captain's Cache</Title>
  <Description>Well, I'm sure you've figured it out by now, eh?

I never was fixing to abandon the crew, I just wanted to move up the ranks. You've helped me out a great deal in that respect.

Speaking of respect, I believe there's the matter of Captain Hartford's lockbox...

Here's the code, courtesy of the fallen captain. Just as I promised. It's all yours!

Now, don't go telling anyone about our little arrangement, okay? I wouldn't want something like that to spoil such a profitable partnership!</Description>
