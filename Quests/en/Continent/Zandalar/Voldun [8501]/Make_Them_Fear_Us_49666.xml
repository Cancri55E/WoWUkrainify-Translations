  <Title>Make Them Fear Us</Title>
  <Description>I carry this banner into every battle because I want the Faithless to fear it. To fear my people.

If I die in the battlefield, surrounded by Faithless, I will die happy.

On that day, I will not need a burial or prayers. But I will need someone to pick up my banner and carry it into the next battle.

If you are of the same mind, plant these banners into the corpse of every Faithless you slay. Let the survivors know who's coming for them.</Description>
