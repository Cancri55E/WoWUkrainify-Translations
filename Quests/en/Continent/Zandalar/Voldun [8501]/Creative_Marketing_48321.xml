  <Description>De Goldtusk Gang is de best gang in all of Zandalar.

I know dat. You know dat. Everyone in de gang knows dat.

But we need to make sure dat everyone who sees our inn knows dat too.

We need something big... Something like a massive gold tusk!

I don't know where we'd find one of those, but I got a plan.

Dere's a huge saurolisk in de oasis. Bring me one of its giant bones and I'll take care of de rest.</Description>
