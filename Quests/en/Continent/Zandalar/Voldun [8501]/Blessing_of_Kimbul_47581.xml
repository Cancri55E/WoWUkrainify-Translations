  <Title>Blessing of Kimbul</Title>
  <Description>The entrance to the temple is sealed by a magical barrier.

According to my scrolls, the barrier can only be lowered by one who has gained the Ring of Tides.

There is a statue somewhere in the temple grounds with the power to bestow the ring, but the ruins are overrun with jungle spiders. Tulu and I are not strong enough to explore the lower ruins ourselves.

If you can gain the Ring of Tides and enter the temple, we may finally be able to face the naga head on!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Acquire the Ring of Tides.</LogDescription>
