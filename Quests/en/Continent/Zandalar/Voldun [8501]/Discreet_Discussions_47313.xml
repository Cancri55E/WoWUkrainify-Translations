  <Description>General Jakra'zet cannot be trusted. 

He is up to something, but I do not know what.

Any who question his actions earn demselves a trip to de sands. 

As long as he remains in power, my city will never be safe.

Speak to his guards. See what you can find out, but be discreet. We do not want to alert Jakra'zet to our actions.</Description>
