  <Description>Just when I thought the Faithless couldn't get any worse, I find out that they're keeping vulpera children trapped down in that crater!

The other vulpera we rescued told me that a big sethrak, Appraiser Versik, is inspecting them on the central platform to determine what he can sell them for.

Selling vulpera kids! Oooh, those Faithless make me so angry!

Please, $p. I'm no fighter. I can't rescue those kids. But if you bring them up here to me, I promise I'll get them out of here safely.</Description>
