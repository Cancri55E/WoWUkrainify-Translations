  <Description>&lt;Sezahjin rummages through his cooking ingredients in frustration.&gt;

Where is Junji? I sent him to scavenge for vulture eggs, but he hasn't returned.

&lt;Sezahjin pauses for a moment.&gt;

He was just going on about de size of saurolisk eggs, but those oversized lizards are far too dangerous for a boy! He can't possibly be so foolish...

If he has gone to de saurolisk breeding grounds... he may already be dead. Please find him before it's too late!</Description>
