  <Description>Do you remember how we met, $p? You were trapped in a Faithless cage, just like the ones in the crater below.

Together, we slaughtered Faithless and earned your freedom in blood.

The vulpera trapped in shackles below can do the same. They just need to be given the chance.

Steal Faithless weapons and give them to the vulpera slaves below. They'll rise up and help you fight the Faithless.

We're going to start a revolt right under their arrogant noses.</Description>
