  <Title>Creeping Death</Title>
  <Description>Scorposhi venom usually induces a slow, creeping death.

It's remarkable that your friend has survived this long.

As with most antivenoms, the thing that kills is also the thing that heals. 

I'll need to extract the venom from several scorpashi stingers to craft the cure.

When the extracted poison is mixed with cactus root salve, we will have the antivenom we need to treat his wounds.</Description>
