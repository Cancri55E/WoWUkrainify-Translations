  <Title>Ending the Madness</Title>
  <Description>Akunda the Exalted is not who he seems. 

He poisoned the eternal spring, sickening all who drank from it. Even I was not immune to his abhorrent alchemy.  

Now he drains my power, abusing my gift to wipe the minds of all who might try to stop him. 

We will not let him succeed. 

What little power I have left, I will lend to you. 

Use it to call the storm and end the madness that has taken over my temple.</Description>
