  <Title>The Fall of Emperor Korthek</Title>
  <Description>Korthek finally approaches.

It's been many years since I've faced him in battle. When he first rose to power, I failed my people. I will not falter again.

I am prepared to do what must be done. What I should have done long ago.

We must kill Korthek and take his key to prevent him, Jakra'zet, or anyone else from ever resurrecting Mythrax.

When you are prepared, we will face him together.</Description>
