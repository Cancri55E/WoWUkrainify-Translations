  <Title>Just a Nip</Title>
  <Description>My tough-guys-in-training are quick learners! 

They do seem to get a bit... bitey... when they're grouchy, though. Too many, and I start to get a little light-headed.

The nearby atrivax plants have a medicinal gel. It is great to treat fresh wounds and nullify venom.

They don't like sharing it. Could you harvest a bit for me?</Description>
