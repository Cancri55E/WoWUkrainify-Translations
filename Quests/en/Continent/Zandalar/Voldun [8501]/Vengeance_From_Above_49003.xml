  <Title>Vengeance From Above</Title>
  <Description>Emperor Korthek hides deep in his stolen temple below ground. We must create such chaos that he has no choice but to emerge to face us.

The vulpera riot is a good start, but it will not be enough. Alone, they are no match for the Faithless army.

Thankfully, they are not alone.

We will ride the mighty Rakjan through the skies. While you throw lightning bombs, I'll use my charged staff to blast the Faithless armies below.

Let us hope that is enough to lure out Korthek. I am eager to finish this.</Description>
