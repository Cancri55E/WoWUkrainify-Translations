  <Title>Unleash the Beasts</Title>
  <Description>The Faithless are arrogant hoarders, capturing people and beasts that can never be truly tamed. All to fuel their endless lust for war.

I've even seen their slavers dragging blood trolls and other dark monsters from the swamps of Nazmir.

I heard terrible noises coming out of a cave while I was scouting the feeding pits up ahead.

Whatever monsters they are hiding in there, find a way to free them and let them exact revenge on the Faithless.</Description>
