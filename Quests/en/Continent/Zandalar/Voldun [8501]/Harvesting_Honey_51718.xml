  <Title>Harvesting "Honey"</Title>
  <Description>I don't know what Rhan'ka's doing down in that oasis with all of the honey he's bought from me. Frankly, I suspect I don't even want to know.

But whatever his reasons, Rhan'ka is my best customer.

So even though my supply's getting low, because Rhan'ka sent you, I'll give you a special deal.

The wasps here keep all their honey stored in their stingers. Bring some to me, so I can drain them for honey and I'll give you a big batch of the sticky stuff to take back to Rhan'ka.</Description>
