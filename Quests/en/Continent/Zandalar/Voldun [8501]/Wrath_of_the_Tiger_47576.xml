  <Title>Wrath of the Tiger</Title>
  <Description>The Tortaka shall have my protection. Even as we speak, an army of the naga have risen from the depths to attack my temple.

How soon the naga have forgotten their previous defeat!

They seek to reclaim the Ring of Tides, a powerful artifact that I took as my trophy when I killed Azshara's previous champion, Mepjila.

I will send you to the battlefield as my avatar to rain destruction upon the naga. They have forgotten what happens to those who trespass against my followers.

Remind them.</Description>
