  <Title>Grozztok the Blackheart</Title>
  <Description>A group of us were dropped off here and left to die. 

Our first night at camp, I was jolted from sleep by de gurgling cries of my fellow exiles. Jakra'zet sent assassins to our camp, looking for Rakera. 

Their leader, Grozztok, came for me, but Rakera intervened. 

She chased him into de dunes, but dat was days ago. 

If you cross paths with Grozztok, don't hesitate to drive a blade into his black heart.</Description>
