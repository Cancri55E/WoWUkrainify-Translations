  <Title>Stolen Satchels</Title>
  <Description>One within our group spoke of a temple in de mountains dat welcomes exiles, though none are permitted to enter without an offering to their loa.

I would have given anything to find some solace in dis wasteland, but now I have nothing, thanks to those thieving assassins.

Each of us had a satchel dat carried de last of our possessions. We didn't have much, but it was more than one troll would need. 

If you search de dunes looking for your friend, could you keep an eye out for our satchels?</Description>
