  <Title>Risky Rescue</Title>
  <Description>The Faithless incursion is just up ahead. 

We tried to get ahead of the siege by attacking their camp in the dead of night, but they knew we were coming. 

Our troops were quickly overwhelmed. 

We called for a retreat, but only a few of us made it out. The fate of those that didn't is unknown...

We don't have the numbers to attempt a rescue ourselves. We can't afford to lose any more fighters. 

You're their only hope.</Description>
