  <Title>Infiltrating the Empire</Title>
  <Description>The heart of the Faithless empire rests just beyond this ridge. We will need to move swiftly and quietly to avoid detection once inside.

Thankfully, my former dwelling is nearby. I know a passage that should allow us to advance into the fortress with minimal resistance. When you are ready, speak with me and I will show you the way.

&lt;Vorrik looks around suspiciously.&gt;

I expected the Faithless to patrol this area... Keep your eyes open for anything suspicious along the path.</Description>
