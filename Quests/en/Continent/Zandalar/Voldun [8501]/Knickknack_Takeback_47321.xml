  <Title>Knickknack Takeback</Title>
  <Description>Nisha told me you came here in search of an exile. One named Rakera? 

We don't know her, but we might be able to help you find her. 

You help us, and we help you. Deal?

We survive by scavenging. We trade what we find, but the sethrak that raided our burrows made away with many of our knickknacks.    

I always knew they were ruthless, but never imagined they'd be so greedy.

Take back what the sethrak have taken, and I'll see that you are provided safe passage through the dunes.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Knickknacks from sethrak within The Serpent's Maw.</LogDescription>
