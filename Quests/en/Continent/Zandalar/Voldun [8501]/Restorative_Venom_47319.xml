  <Title>Restorative Venom</Title>
  <Description>Meerah here found your friend in the dunes. The lightning strike nearly killed her. It might still, without treatment. 

The wasps within the grove have a painful sting, but their venom also has restorative properties. 

I can extract what I need from their glands.

With an ample amount of venom, we should be able to soothe your friend's wounds.</Description>
