  <Title>Untame Slaughter</Title>
  <Description>The Faithless rely on their krolusks for everything. They are mounts, battle companions, beasts of burden, and often even food to fuel the sethrak empire.

If we can disrupt their krolusks, we'll disrupt their whole empire. One broken wheel stops the caravan, eh?

Take out as many of their krolusk tamers as you can. That'll have a longer impact than just killing the krolusks.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa Faithless within the Feeding Pits.</LogDescription>
