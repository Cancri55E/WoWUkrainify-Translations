  <Title>Allies in Anarchy</Title>
  <Description>Even after all these years, I can feel the ancient power of Sethraliss in this place. My loa endures.

Our task ahead is great and I will need a clear, focused mind to accomplish it. Allow me a few moments to meditate here, like I did in ages past.

In the meantime, you should help the vulpera stir up trouble however you can. They seem to know you, and a large enough disturbance will distract the Faithless from our mission.

Meet me back here when you're done and we'll proceed together.</Description>
