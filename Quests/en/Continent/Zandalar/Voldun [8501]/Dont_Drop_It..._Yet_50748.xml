  <Title>Don't Drop It... Yet</Title>
  <Description>The Faithless are training pterrordaxes as mounts so that they can rain down death from the skies.

Their skycallers have developed a means of storing volatile lightning magic into fragile crystals. Lightning bombs, in the simplest sense. The magic behind it is quite brilliant, really.

The bombs will be exceptionally useful if we can secure the aid of Rakjan, the powerful and fierce pterrordax at the top of this mountain.

Acquire as many as you can carry, while I will do my best to recruit Rakjan.</Description>
