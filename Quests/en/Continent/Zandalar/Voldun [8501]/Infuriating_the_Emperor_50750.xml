  <Title>Infuriating the Emperor</Title>
  <Description>It seems I underestimated Korthek's cowardice. I expected him to be behind the barrier, ready to ambush us. Yet, still he hides.

That allows us a few moments to prepare. We musn't waste them.

While I siphon power off of these immense crystals, you must thin the numbers of the Faithless here. I will grant you a powerful boon to speed you in your task.

When Korthek arrives, he will require our full attention.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Vorrik's Bulwark to defeat $1oa Faithless within the Sacred Sands.</LogDescription>
