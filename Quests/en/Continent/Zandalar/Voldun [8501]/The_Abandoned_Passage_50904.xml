  <Title>The Abandoned Passage</Title>
  <Description>My people have known about this ancient passageway for generations, but none have dared enter before now.

The tunnel leads to the tomb of Mythrax the Unraveler and it is said that his power still radiates within the cavern. Who knows what horrors await us inside...

It appears that your friends have already gone inside to face Jakra'zet and stop him from raising Mythrax from the dead.

We don't have time to waste. We must find Kaja and Rakera before they confront Jakra'zet on their own!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Bladeguard Kaja and Warguard Rakera in Atul'Aman.</LogDescription>
