  <Title>Siphoning Souls</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Tacha rummages through her sack of scavenged supplies.&gt;

So these golems are powered by Zandalari souls?

No problem... I've had to deal with that before... I've got just the tool for it.

&lt;Tacha pulls out an eerie Zandalari totem.&gt;

Here it is! Found this ol' soulcatcher totem in one of the southern ruins years ago. It's gotten us out of a few jams.

Disable the golems and throw down this totem next to it. It'll siphon off the souls.

Keep the totem. We'll need it later.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa Soul-Trapped Guardians and use the Soulcatcher Totem to siphon their souls from their corpse.</LogDescription>
