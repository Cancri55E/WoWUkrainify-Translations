  <Description>The naga are searching for a powerful artifact called the Ring of Tides.

According to the invasion plans, the ring was lost long ago in a battle with Eraka no Kimbul, the great tiger loa.

The temple of Eraka no Kimbul is just to the north. If the loa was strong enough to defeat the naga before, maybe he can do it again!

We must let the tribe know what we've found!

Take the invasion plans to Elder Kuppaka. He is the oldest, and wisest member of our tribe. He will know what to do.</Description>
