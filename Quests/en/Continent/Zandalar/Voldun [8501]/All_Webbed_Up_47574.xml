  <Description>The lower ruins of the temple are covered in thick webs and spider egg sacs.

Some of our tribesman went down to the lower ruins to clear out the spiders, but they haven't come back.

I fear for their safety.

Please head into the lower ruins and free our brethren before it's too late.</Description>
