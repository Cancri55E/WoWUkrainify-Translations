  <Title>The Source of the Problem</Title>
  <Description>I checked my work twice when working on this fountain. I made no mistakes. 

There must be something wrong at the source. 

The fountain draws water from a modest reservoir above the terrace. 

Would you mind checking it out?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Ranah determine the cause of the malfunctioning fountain within the Withering Terrace.</LogDescription>
