  <Title>Rhan'ka's Lost Friend</Title>
  <Description>When you head up to Dead Man's Pass, be sure to say hello to Zulsan.

He's my best friend, even if he doesn't want to be near me most of de time. Ha!

Seriously, though, he's been up on de cliffs for days. If you find him, convince him to come back down to de inn. We need him to restock our breakfast buffet.

Oh, and a completely unrelated question dat has nothing to do with you not being able to find Zulsan and my needing to replace him: How wide is ya head?</Description>
