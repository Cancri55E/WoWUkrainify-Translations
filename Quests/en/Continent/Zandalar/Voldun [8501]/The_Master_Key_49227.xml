  <Title>The Master Key</Title>
  <Description>None of the keys you found were the right fit! We're going to need another plan...

I've heard that Overseer Morrison has a master key that can open any lock in the compound. It's dangerous, but I need you to get that key for me!

You'll find her running the mining operation inside the cave. Once you get the key, make sure you rescue any vulpera captives that you find.

Once you've rescued my friends, meet me back here and release me. Good luck!</Description>
