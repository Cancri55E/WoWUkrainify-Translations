  <Description>Everywhere we go, there they are. Sethrak. And it's never the ones you want to see.

It seems they are looking for some key. With this new information, I do not think they are looking in the right place.

Really, as entertaining as it is to confound them, we need to wrap up our work here and move on.

If you could remove some of them, it would greatly help our crew!</Description>
