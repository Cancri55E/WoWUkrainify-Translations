  <Title>Crabby Crew Stew</Title>
  <Description>Shouldn't you be in the mines? Look, I won't tell Morrison if you won't. I wouldn't want to be stuck in those mines, either. 

We could use a hand out here, though. The crew is getting crabby. We've been eating nothing but slop and the occasional rat for weeks. 

I hear one of the deckhands makes a marvelous crab stew. Can I count on you to secure the meat?</Description>
