  <Title>They've Got Golems</Title>
  <Description>I've sacked countless ruins across Vol'dun. Everything from saurolisk-infested dens to the cursed Port of Zem'lan.

I don't say this to brag. I want you to understand that I know what I'm doing.

I've survived this long because I take my time, avoid risks, and only take what I need.

That's what we'll be doing here today.

Omi reported heavy golem activity on her first scouting trip into the ruins. Zandalari golems are formidable. We need to learn what's powering them before we head in.</Description>
