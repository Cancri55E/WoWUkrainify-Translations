  <Title>Offering for the Loa</Title>
  <Description>The time has come for you to make contact with the great loa Eraka no Kimbul.

I can only imagine what it will be like to be in the presence of such an ancient and powerful deity. You have earned the Ring of Tides, so it must be you that addresses the loa. 

Please present the loa with this offering from our tribe. Tell him of our plight against the naga.

Eraka no Kimbul is our only hope of survival now.</Description>
