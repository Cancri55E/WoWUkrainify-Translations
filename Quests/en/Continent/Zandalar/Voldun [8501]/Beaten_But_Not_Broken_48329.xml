  <Title>Beaten But Not Broken</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Beastbreaker Hakid's crystal-encrusted key looks like it will open the large cage nearby.

The pterrordax inside that cage, Scion of Rakjan, is stronger than the other hatchlings you've seen in the Crackling Ridge. He holds his head high and doesn't seem bothered by the myriad scars and fresh wounds that cover his body.

If you release him, he'll likely want to return to Rakjan the Unbroken at the top peak of Crackling Ridge.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Free the Scion of Rakjan and lead him to Rakjan the Unbroken.</LogDescription>
