  <Title>Securing a Foothold</Title>
  <Description>Alleria and I have scouted this area before, alongside some of our best soldiers. We stationed encampments on either side of our current position, but I fear they will have come under heavy attack. They need reinforcements.$b$bOur first order of business is to set up a teleportation beacon directly below the Vindicaar. From there, we will have access to both fronts.$b$bSpeak to Romuul when you are ready to head down to the surface.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel to the Antoran Wastes and place the Lightforged Beacon.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Good. From here we can quickly access and reinforce each of the encampments.</RewardText>
