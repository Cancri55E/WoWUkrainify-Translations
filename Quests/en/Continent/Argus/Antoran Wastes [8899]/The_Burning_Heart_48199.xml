  <Title>The Burning Heart</Title>
  <Description>The loss of Xe'ra is a blow, especially to Turalyon. But even the Light Mother could not be allowed to force destiny upon us.

I wish Illidan had found another way to refuse her... but I too have had choices imposed upon me by the naaru.

This must not distract us from our mission. Now that we have the Army of the Light survivors with us, it is time to press our attack.

We need a foothold on the Antoran Wastes from which we can assault the Burning Throne. It is time to deprive Sargeras of his prize!</Description>
