  <Title>Hindering the Legion War Machine</Title>
  <Description>$ct, I could use your help. The Army of the Light is coordinating an attack against the Spirit Crucible, Terminus, and Shaper's Rise to cripple the Legion's ability to wage war outside of the Antoran Wastes. We do not have enough soldiers to defend our footholds and execute this operation.

Will you approach the $cs on our behalf? This gambit could succeed with them fighting by our side. We can paralyze the Legion war machine.</Description>
