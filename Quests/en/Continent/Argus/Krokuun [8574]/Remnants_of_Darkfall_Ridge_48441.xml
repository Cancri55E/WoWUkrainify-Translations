  <Title>Remnants of Darkfall Ridge</Title>
  <Description>My riders have talbuk, but my people need supplies. Food. Tools. Weapons.

For millennia, we have migrated from one hovel to the next, moving each time the Legion discovered us. Never able to flee with our possessions, we left them behind.

You are powerful, your followers are capable, but you do not know Argus. The landscape will dispatch you as mercilessly as the Legion. Recover our supplies from Darkfall Ridge, and I will order my people to guide your forces through the Argus Wastes.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Scouting Map and complete the mission, "Darkfall Ridge Supplies".</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you found our supplies, $n?</CompletionText>
