  <Title>Heralds of Apocalypse</Title>
  <Description>We've been presented with a rare opportunity.

Our scouts have spotted two shivarra priestesses in the western fel pools enhancing the Legion's war effort.

The inner circle of Sargeras' chosen never leave the walls of Antorus. If we take them out, we might be able to sow fear among those closest to the Dark Titan.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Lady Heretica and Mistress Apostriss.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>This may be our only chance to kill one of those sick monsters before we assault Antorus itself.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Impressive. Without the shivarra bolstering their strength we just might stand a chance.</RewardText>
