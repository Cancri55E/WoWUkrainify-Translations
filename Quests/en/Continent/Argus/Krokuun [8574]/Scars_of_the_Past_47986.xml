  <Title>Scars of the Past</Title>
  <Description>The Army of the Light's warframes have won countless battles on Argus. Despite their power, not all who descend into the fray return.

My modifications to this frame should give us the edge we need, but several critical components are still missing.

There are remains of battles past in Nath'raxas that we can still scavenge. If you can find the pieces I need, the Legion will feel our fury yet.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover an Invocation Array, Vindicator Plating, and a Judgment Core.</LogDescription>
