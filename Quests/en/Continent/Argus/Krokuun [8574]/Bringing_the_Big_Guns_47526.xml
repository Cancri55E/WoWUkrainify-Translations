  <Title>Bringing the Big Guns</Title>
  <Description>Light's Judgment has a security feature to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. We can trigger its recall mechanism, which will teleport it back to a vessel.$b$bWith the Xenedar out of commission, the gun should recall to your ship instead. You can make good use of its firepower.$b$bThe process takes time, though, and will likely attract the Legion's attention. Be on your guard.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate and secure Light's Judgment.</LogDescription>
