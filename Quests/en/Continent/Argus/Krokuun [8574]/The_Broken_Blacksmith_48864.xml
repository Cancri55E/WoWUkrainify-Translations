  <Title>The Broken Blacksmith</Title>
  <Description>$C, I believe this may be a piece of the key to the Armory of the Triumvirate. We locked it behind us as we made our escape from Argus. The last time I saw it, my second in command, Atalaa, was leading a force to secure the armory. That was so long ago...

I cannot be certain, but there may be another who would know. The smith who forged the key was called Gaal. With the reports of broken surviving on Krokuun, he may still live.</Description>
