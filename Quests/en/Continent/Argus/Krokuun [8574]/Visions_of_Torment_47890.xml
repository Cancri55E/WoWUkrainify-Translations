  <Title>Visions of Torment</Title>
  <Description>I've been hearin' whispers ever since we got to Argus. They're just like Azeroth's, only... they ain't hers.

I'm convinced that Argus has a titan of its own that's reachin' out to us!

The broken have a relic stowed away that's darn near holy to 'em. Hatuun says they hear whispers from it... I think it might have some sort o' link to Argus itself!

It's just in this chamber. Let's see what we can learn.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Activate the Sacred Stone to witness Argus' vision with Magni.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I don't know how Sargeras managed to raise Aggramar, but it's bad news for us, believe you me.</RewardText>
