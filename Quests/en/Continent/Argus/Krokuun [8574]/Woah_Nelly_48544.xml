  <Title>Woah, Nelly!</Title>
  <Description>$n, you have my thanks. My Wranglers should be able to take it from here. If I can ask one more favor, would you pass a message to Chieftain Hatuun? Tell him the forest is secure once again. I'm sure he will reward you for all of your effort.

I'll loan you one of my fastest Cragscalers for the trip. Make sure to look both ways before crossing that path outside this forest, there's a giant Legion Obliterator that patrols there. Good luck!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Chieftain Hatuun in Krokul Hovel.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The Wranglers are essential for our survival here. Any assistance you have given them must be repaid.</RewardText>
