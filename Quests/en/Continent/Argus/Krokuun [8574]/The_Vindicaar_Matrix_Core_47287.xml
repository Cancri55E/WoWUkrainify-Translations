  <Title>The Vindicaar Matrix Core</Title>
  <Description>Much has happened on Argus that concerns me but none moreso than Xe'ra's fate. I wonder sometimes if we are doing the right thing? $b$bBut we must carry on. I can rig the Matrix Core that powers the Vindicaar to allow you to call on the power of our guns when you have need of them on the planet. $b$bGo to the Matrix Core in the room at the heart of our ship. Once linked, whatever powers the core has installed now and in the future will be at your disposal.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Link Light's Judgment into the Vindicaar Matrix Core.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you linked Light's Judgment into the Vindicaar Matrix Core?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Light's Judgment will now fire on your command when you use the Matrix Uplink. $b$bPerhaps you will find more objects that we can link into the Matrix on your travels. I have routed enough energy to that part of the Core to handle anything that you can link into it. $b$bGo well, my friend.</RewardText>
