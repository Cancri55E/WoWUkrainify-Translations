  <Title>Long Overdue</Title>
  <Description>I have learned much. High Inquisitor Raalgar has moved to a base near the Legion citadel across the mountains. This is where he keeps the Fel Heart of Argus, the source of his immortality, and it is powered by wells leading directly to the core of Argus. $b$bHe is preparing to attack so you will strike first. Mark the location of the wells and I will rain holy fire upon them with the Vindicaar's guns. With that connection to the fel on Argus broken, Raalgar can be killed and the Fel Heart retrieved.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Mark the Argussian Heartwells for the Vindicaar's guns, kill the Legion garrison, and retrieve the Fel Heart of Argus from High Inquisitor Raalgar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you dealt with High Inquisitor Raalgar yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You are a true hero, $n. Even though the demons freed Raalgar and thought him immortal, he was no match for you! Perhaps the Fel Heart will be of use to you. It is now available in the Matrix Core.</RewardText>
