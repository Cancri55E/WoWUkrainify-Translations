  <Title>Fragment of the Past</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Your eye is drawn to the faint glow of the crystalline fragment. Examining the piece, you trace the partial pattern of a rune that had been inscribed upon its surface.

The fragment appears similar to the argunite crystals used by the Army of the Light to power their armaments. Could this crystal have belonged to the eredar who fought to escape Argus so long ago?

Perhaps Captain Fareeya would be able to tell you more about the crystal.&gt;</Description>
