  <Title>The Power to Reforge</Title>
  <Description>I forged the key using a pristine argunite crystal. Unfortunately, the only ones remaining are used by the Army of the Light's defenses.

Hmm... dendrite clusters might be an alternative. They were used by the elite of Eredath to power simple devices. If enough of the city ruins are still intact, I'd wager the fallen magi or the broken may still have some in their possession. 

Of course, I would need a great many clusters to reforge the key. It seems you have your work cut out for you.</Description>
