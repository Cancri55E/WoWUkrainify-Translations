  <Description>This broken still retains some of his sanity, though not all of it.$b$bI can sense some Void influence nearby, but it is isolated to small pockets. Dispelling these manifestations should help our friend here clear his mind.$b$bPerhaps we can use the prayer fragments you found, as they still contain some Light energy.$b$bI will try and make sense of his chattering in the meantime. Maybe we can learn something about what is happening here.</Description>
