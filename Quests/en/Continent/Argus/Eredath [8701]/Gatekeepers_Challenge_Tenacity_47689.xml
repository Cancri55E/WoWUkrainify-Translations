Absolute conviction was required to succeed under him.$b$bAt the opposite end of the Conservatory you will find a large structure. Once inside, your goal is to overcome all the obstacles placed before you.$b$b Emerge unscathed and I will be forced to consider your will strong enough to proceed.</Description>
