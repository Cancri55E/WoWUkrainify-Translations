  <Title>Recovering the Pieces</Title>
  <Description>The fragment you found is only one part of the key. I fear the other pieces have fallen into the hands of these ethereal beings you speak of... the Shadowguard. 

We must recover them all. The Shadowguard leaders and lieutenants in and around the Seat of the Triumvirate may well have the fragments in their possession.

Get those key fragments, $n... any way you have to.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Secure the missing key fragments from the ethereals around the Seat of the Triumvirate.</LogDescription>
