  <Title>Relics of the Ancient Eredar</Title>
  <Description>I failed Arkhaan. I won't fail again. 

If there is to be any hope of freeing the krokul, the ethereal threat must be removed from Eredath. L'ura has been vanquished, but the void clings heavily near the Shadowguard Incursion.

Before we commence, ensure your forces are protected from the shadow. Your champions should seek ancient eredar armaments in the nearby ruins.</Description>
