  <Title>Conservation of Magic</Title>
  <Description>I have an idea. This construct will be of use to us. We simply need to jolt it awake.$b$bWe once stored great quantities of energy in conduits throughout the Conservatory. They are still functional, but only just.$b$bTake this.$b$b&lt;Y'mera hands you a brightly glowing crystal.&gt;$b$bIt will provide a small burst of magic that should help stabilize an erratic conduit. I think I have enough stored for eight or so.$b$bStabilizing a few should allow us to access the whole network.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Stabilize 8 Erratic Power Conduits.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did it work? I am curious if that crystal holds enough power to accomplish our goals.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Yes, excellent. The conduits are back online.$b$bThe construct however is proving a little more difficult to awaken than I had hoped.</RewardText>
