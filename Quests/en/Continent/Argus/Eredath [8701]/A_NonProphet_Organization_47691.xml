  <Description>I have complete faith that Velen is nearby. We would know if he had been captured.$b$bAll the same, we must not delay. The Legion has a vested interest in finding him after all he has done to resist them. I shudder to think what they might do, given the chance.$b$bThat is why I am going with you.$b$bWe will find Velen and help him track down the Crest of Knowledge. We must have faith in his mission or all will be lost.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate Velen.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You came upon me in a moment of reflection.$b$b&lt;Velen peers at you with a tired expression.&gt;$b$bThere is no time for such sentiment. We must press on.</RewardText>
