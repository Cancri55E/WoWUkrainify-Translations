  <Title>The Dark Ranger's Pupil</Title>
  <Description>I am Moorgoth, hunter of fearsome foes and hero of the Trueshot Lodge.

You are a renowned champion of the Alliance, but I've been told you save those in peril. Please hear me out.

I am friends with a ranger named Velonara. She serves the Horde, but I assure you she is a noble soul.

She's been training an apprentice ranger who disappeared after receiving a letter from his brother. Velonara has gone to Tirisfal Glades to find him.

I have a bad feeling about this. Would you check on her safety?</Description>
