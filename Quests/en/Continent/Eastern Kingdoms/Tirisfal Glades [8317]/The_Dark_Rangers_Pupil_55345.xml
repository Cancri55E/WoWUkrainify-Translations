  <Title>The Dark Ranger's Pupil</Title>
  <Description>Thank the abyss you're here, champion!

I am Moorgoth, tracker of fearsome foes in dark places. Anyone in the Trueshot Lodge will vouch for my credentials.

Dark Ranger Velonara and I are good friends, and I fear she is in peril.

She's been training an apprentice dark ranger. Newly raised, she said. At any rate, her pupil ran off after receiving a letter from his brother, and now Velonara has gone to Tirisfal Glades to find him.

I have a bad feeling about all this. Could you check on her safety?</Description>
