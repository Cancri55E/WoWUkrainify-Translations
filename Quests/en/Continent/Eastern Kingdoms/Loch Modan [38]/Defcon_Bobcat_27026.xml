  <Description>Stop everything! It's come to my attention that there's been bobcat sightings near the lodge. Bobcats!$B$BNow mind you, I've never seen a bobcat, but they're surely dangerous. They're like mountain lions or something. I don't want anyone leaving until the area is secure!$B$BAnyone but you, that is. I'll pay you to help secure the area, $c. But don't get your face ripped off.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 Bobcats.</LogDescription>
