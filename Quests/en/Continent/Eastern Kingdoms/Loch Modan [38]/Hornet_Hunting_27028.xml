  <Title>Hornet Hunting</Title>
  <Description>We're always looking for new game around here. Daryl may like his boars, but the rest of us prefer things more exotic.$B$BNow, I'd never say the Loch draining was a good thing, but it did have a silver lining. The swampy ground's brought in new prey: Hornets!$B$BGiant hornets, mind you. Not many hunters have tussled with massive bugs before. It's rather novel.$B$BIf you'd like to give it a try, I'll wager with you. Bring me back some of those nice glossy wings of theirs and I'll pay up.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 6 Glassy Hornet Wings.</LogDescription>
