  <Title>Clutching at Chaos</Title>
  <Description>The cultists of the Twilight's Hammer use their powers to draw elementium metal from deep beneath the earth. They coax it out into twisted spikes to form their buildings, rooted right into the defiled ground.$B$BThe ogres here seem to be in the middle of weaving the stuff, and we need to strike while they're still twisting it into shape.$B$BTear the spikes right out of the ground while they're still pliable, and bring them back to me! We're not going to give these curs a single inch of our land.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Pull up 10 Nascent Elementium Spikes from the ground of the Mo'grosh Stronghold.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you tear up the spikes?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Shame that these half-formed things are too brittle and warped to be used for some weapons of our own. But it's thanks to you that we had the chance to get them out before they set. I'm not about to complain.</RewardText>
