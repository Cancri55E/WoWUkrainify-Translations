  <Title>A Tiny, Clever Commander</Title>
  <Description>We've dealt with kobolds in these lands for years. Not much other than a nuisance. But they've been getting craftier at their stealing.$B$BI think one of them's ended up smarter than usual. Won't be that way for long, though!$B$BI want you to go to the camp south of here and make sure there's not a "big shot" kobold stirrin' up the other ones. Make sure to check the cave; it's a likely spot.$B$BAnd don't be shy about clearing out the other kobolds along the way.</Description>
