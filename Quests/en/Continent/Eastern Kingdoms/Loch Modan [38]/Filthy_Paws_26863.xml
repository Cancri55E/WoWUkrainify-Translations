  <Title>Filthy Paws</Title>
  <Description>The Silver Stream Mine to the east ran dry long ago. It was converted by the Miners' League into a storage depot, but now kobolds have moved in, putting their filthy paws on good, dwarven tools!$B$BWe'll root out those vermin soon enough, but the League wants someone to get their gear out of the mine before we warriors tromp in there and break things.  It'll be a tough delve - you might want cohorts at your side.$B$BThe gear is stored in Miners' League Crates throughout the mine.  Good luck.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 6 loads of Miners' Gear from the Silver Stream Mine.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have that Miners' Gear, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Did you see a lot of kobolds in there? The thought of their grimy hands clawing around our mine makes my stomach rumble!</RewardText>
