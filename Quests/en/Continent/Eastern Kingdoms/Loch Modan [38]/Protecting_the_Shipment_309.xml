  <Title>Protecting the Shipment</Title>
  <Description>We need to get this powder to Ironband, but this cart isn't going anywhere now. It'll be a lot for us to carry, and these parts can get dangerous -- and who knows what else the Dark Irons might have in store for us now that Saean is with them.$b$bI'll feel a lot better if you helped me watch over things. Miran can offload the powder kegs at camp while you and I protect the cart.</Description>
  <AreaDescription>Protect the Ironband Caravan</AreaDescription>
  <LogDescription>Protect Huldar and the Ironband Caravan, and then inform Prospector Ironband.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak with Prospector Ironband at Ironband's Excavation Site in Loch Modan.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>It is troubling news that you bring. To think that the Dark Irons have sympathizers able to procure this sort of material for their dastardly plans.$b$bThat's a matter for someone else to consider, some other time. Thank you for protecting Huldar and the cart!</RewardText>
