  <Title>Servants of Cho'gall</Title>
  <Description>The Twilight's Hammer started as a clan of the savage Horde. Their leader, Cho'gall, slowly turned his band of ogres into a death cult, welcoming anyone insane enough to wish for the end of all existence. As you can see, there's still plenty of ogres among their ranks; deranged, fanatical, and just as strong as before.$B$BThese crude monsters have the gall to come here and spread their filth across our land. The more you kill, the better off Loch Modan will be, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 7 Mo'grosh ogres in the Mo'grosh Stronghold.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It may look grim, but we'll win with your help, $n. They won't keep the dwarves down.</RewardText>
