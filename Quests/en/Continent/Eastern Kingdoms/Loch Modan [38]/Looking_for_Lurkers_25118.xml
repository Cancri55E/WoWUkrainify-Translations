  <Title>Looking for Lurkers</Title>
  <Description>I don't know about you, but I'm not much a fan of spiders, much less the kind that come bigger than me. Loch Modan's a gorgeous place, but I'd say it could do without those horrid things waltzing around.$B$BTell you what, I've got some spare coin, and you look like a tough one. If you head out and off some of those things for me, I'll pay you for your time.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 Forest Lurkers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'll rest easier knowing one of those lumbering things won't be wandering into my bedroom at night... again.  Thanks much.</RewardText>
