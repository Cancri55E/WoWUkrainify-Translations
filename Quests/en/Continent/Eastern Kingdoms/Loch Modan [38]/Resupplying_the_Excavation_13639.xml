  <Title>Resupplying the Excavation</Title>
  <Description>Ironband has an excavation to the southeast and he's been needing a hefty amount of explosives sent from the league for all the carving. Huldar, Miran, and Saean just departed with the most recent load and could probably use a hand.$B$BThey can't have made it very far, strong as they are. They can only move so fast laden down with those barrels.$b$bThey're taking the normal route to the site, leaving south out of town and following the curve of the Loch. Go catch up with them and help'm out, will ya?</Description>
  <AreaDescription>Find Huldar, Miran, and Saean</AreaDescription>
  <LogDescription>Locate Huldar, Miran, and Saean.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Hmph, it'll take more than a Dark Iron ambush to stop the deliveries!$b$bBut Saean... I would never have suspected him to be one of their sympathizers. We've been working with him for almost a year now... maybe I missed the signs.$b$bWell, I'll consider that later.</RewardText>
