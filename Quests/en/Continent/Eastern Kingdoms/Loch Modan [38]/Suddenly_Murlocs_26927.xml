  <Title>Suddenly, Murlocs!</Title>
  <Description>So we've got troggs working for kobolds, and kobolds working for gnolls. The gnolls must've moved in from the Wetlands.$B$BHow do I know? Well, they brought friends, because what's left of the Loch is swarming with Bluegill murlocs that were never there before.$B$BPests are pests, but this coordination is worrying. I need you to talk to Cannary Caskshot. She's one of the best hunters in these parts, and she'll know how to handle murlocs, if you can pull her away from her mug long enough.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Cannary Caskshot.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Murlocs? Sure, I've hunted murlocs.$B$BAnd every single stinkin' one of them deserved what they got! You hear me?</RewardText>
