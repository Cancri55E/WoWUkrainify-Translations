  <Title>Bird is the Word</Title>
  <Description>I've actually nearly perfected my dream machine: The Skystrider! The world's first flying Mechanostrider! But, well$B$BWhen I was putting the finishing touches on it in my secret cavern lab, my other creations became, er, jealous. Giving mechanical birds a personality to begin with was probably a bad idea, but that's already done.$B$BI need the Supermechanical Robo-Widget from the original Skystrider if I want to rebuild it! Please, journey into the cave and retrieve it for me!</Description>
