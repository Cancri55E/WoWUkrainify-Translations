  <Title>Out of Gnoll-where</Title>
  <Description>Well met, $c. We've got a problem, and I'd ask you to lend a hand.$B$BIt's gnolls. There's a mess of the things west of town, roaming the hills. Not usually any cause for alarm, but we've not usually had gnolls here in Loch Modan.$B$BI'm curious where they came from, but not curious enough to bother asking the mangy things. Clear 'em out, I say. Bring back proof of your kills and I'll pay a solid bounty.</Description>
