  <Title>Vyrin's Revenge</Title>
  <Description>I don't suppose you'd be interested in a little payback for His Boldness? Daryl does have some skill, it pains me to say.$b$bA year ago, a large bear had been the target of the Farstrider Lodge, but none of the hunters had any luck with him. So, Daryl thought he'd try his hand against him. All he had to show for his effort was that ugly scar over his eye.$b$bKill the bear, and I'm sure even Daryl would be speechless for once.$b$bThe bear, Ol' Sooty, can be found around his lair in the cave to the north.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Kill Ol' Sooty and obtain his head.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Ah, $n! Back so soon? No doubt you've been at the hunt again? Don't worry if you've had some setbacks, in the long run it will make you better!$b$b...You couldn't get much worse, anyway...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Er... what's this? A bear's head, by the looks of it.$b$b&lt;He runs a finger along his scar unconsciously.&gt;$b$bWell, that's quite an interesting kill you have yourself there. Couldn't be that bear from back then...$b$b&lt;He trails off then starts to visibly shake.&gt;$b$bOh, take that away take it away! Get that grisly thing out of here!</RewardText>
