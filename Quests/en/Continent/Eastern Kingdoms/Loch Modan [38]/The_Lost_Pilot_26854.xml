  <Title>The Lost Pilot</Title>
  <Description>My friend and fellow Siege Engine pilot, Mori Hildelve, is lost in the hills. We were looking for a rare ore that's needed for a high-grade blastpowder, and during our search he drove his engine up a steep hill and busted it!$B$BStill convinced that ore was in these mountains, Hildelve charged me to guard our engines while he continued on foot.$B$BIt's been days, and I've heard some beastly growls north of Helm's Bed Lake, west of the tunnel. Mori's tough as nails, but I'm worried.$B$BPlease, $n. Find him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Pilot Hildelve north of Helm's Bed Lake.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Here is the corpse of a dwarf -- mauled, frozen, and picked clean by mountain scavengers.  Clutched in its hand is a book containing the roughly scribbled notes of Mori Hildelve.  And around its frame, still in superior condition, is a Brigadier's Vest.$B$BThis grisly scene must have been where the Siege Engine pilot met his end.</RewardText>
