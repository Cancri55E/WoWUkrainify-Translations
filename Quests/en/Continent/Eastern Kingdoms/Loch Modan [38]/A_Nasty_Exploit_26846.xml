  <Title>A Nasty Exploit</Title>
  <Description>I've found out what those rats are up to. There's so many of them outside because they've got troggs digging for them in the mine!$B$BThe tunnel rat geomancers figured out some kind of parlor trick to control the troggs, as creatures of the earth or somesuch.$B$BFascinating, but not something we want to let them practice. Take out those geomancers right away.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 5 Tunnel Rat Geomancers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'm sure that only worked because the troggs aren't bright to begin with. But then again, us dwarves were once creatures of the earth as well.$B$BBeing bossed around by a kobold doesn't sound quite dignified, and I'm glad we didn't get to find out if they could pull that off.</RewardText>
