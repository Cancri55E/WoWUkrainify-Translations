  <Title>Scrapped Golems</Title>
  <Description>We keep golems here, as guards.  The dwarves to our north also keep golems, but I'm not sure why.$b$bMainly just for killin', I suppose.$b$bWe could use some spare parts for our own golems, so here's what yer gonna do: kill theirs, then look for any parts that might've fallen on the ground.  Salvage what ye can.  Ye probably won't be able to salvage everything, so choose carefully.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill War Reavers in the Ruins of Thaurissan, then loot 3 Obsidian Pistons, 3 Flux Exhaust Sieves, 3 Thorium Gearshafts, and 1 Stone Power Core from the War Reaver Parts that they drop.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We build these golems ourselves, ye know.  A little mechanical work, a little elemental work... the results aren't half bad, if ye ask me.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is exactly what we needed.  I'll get the boys workin' on the next batch of golems right away.</RewardText>
