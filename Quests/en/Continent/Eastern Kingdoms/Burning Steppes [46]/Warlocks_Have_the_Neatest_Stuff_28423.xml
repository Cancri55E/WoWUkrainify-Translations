  <Title>Warlocks Have the Neatest Stuff</Title>
  <Description>Ariok said he needs supplies?  I've got plenty of supplies!  Problem is, those warlocks have kicked me out of my home, and they're not letting me back in.$b$b&lt;Gorzeeki sizes you up.&gt;$b$bYou might be able to get in, though.  Head north, and grab some of my slumber sand, my fel slider cider, and a clear glass orb.  I'm pretty sure that's what he wants.$b$bOh, and if you happen to accidentally kill any of those orcs while you're up there, I wouldn't be terribly upset.</Description>
