  <Title>A Delivery for Neeralak</Title>
  <Description>The warlocks of the Blackrock Clan often practice their magic in the Skull Warren, a cave on the eastern side of Dreadmaul Rock.  Their leader, Xi'lun, is busy elsewhere, so the cave is currently being held by another of the Big Three: Dragon-Lord Neeralak.  And Neeralak's expertise is in dragons, not in necromancy.$b$bI've used the slumber sand on those flamekin you captured.  Try to convince Neeralak that they're warlock imps, and not flamekin.  When they wake up, they won't be happy.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Using your Blackrock Disguise, sneak into the Skull Warren and convince Dragon-Lord Neeralak to take your Crate of Sleeping Flamekin.  Speak with Eitrigg if you need a new Blackrock Disguise.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>What are these?  Oh, are these imps?$b$bI'm pretty sure that imps don't just fall asleep in boxes!$b$bI'll take your word for it, though.  I don't understand any of this warlock crap.  Leave them in the corner.</RewardText>
