  <Title>Stocking Up</Title>
  <Description>If we're going to wage war against the Blackrock clan, we're going to need to plan ahead.  My colonel has already put the plan together - now it's time to execute.$b$bI need scorpid stingers... the sharpest ones you can find.  Scorpids are all over the steppes, but you can find most of them in the gulch to the west.$b$bDon't worry about what they're for.  You'll find out soon enough.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 5 Razor-Sharp Scorpid Barbs.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Back already?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Those scorpids are easy to underestimate.  You're lucky you didn't end up on the end of one of these barbs.  Or maybe you're just good.$b$bI'll add these to the stockpile.  We're not done yet, $r.</RewardText>
