  <Title>A Heap of Delicious Worg</Title>
  <Description>We're going to need fresh meat, which means you're going to be hunting worg.  The worg on this side of the steppes should be your target.$b$b&lt;Eitrigg produces a large blade, which he hands to you.&gt;$b$bHunt the giant ember worgs.  Once you've killed them, use this saw to remove the choicest bits of meat from their bodies.  You will find these worgs all over the steppes, but the closest pack rules the land just to our southeast.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Worgsaw on the bodies of slain Giant Ember Worgs to obtain 40 Worg Cutlets.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Any luck out there?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This meat looks good... but I think it needs a little "seasoning".  I'll make sure that gets taken care of.$b$bThank you, $n.</RewardText>
