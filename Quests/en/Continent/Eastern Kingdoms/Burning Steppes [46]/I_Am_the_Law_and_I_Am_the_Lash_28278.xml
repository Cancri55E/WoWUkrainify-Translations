  <Description>I've been looking for a good, strong soldier like you.  I need someone to keep my troops in line.$b$bOutside the stronghold, you will find orcs, ogres, and trolls preparing for the assault on Redridge.  My sergeants keep them in line, but I'd like you to assist them.$b$bTake this cudgel and discipline a few of my soldiers.  I don't care if they're misbehaving or standing perfectly in line, I want them beaten.  I want them focused, battle-hardened, and obedient.$b$bNow go.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Blackrock Cudgel of Discipline on 20 troops in the Fields of Honor.  If one of the troops discovers your disguise, cudgel him to death before he can unmask you.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I have a feeling we'll be hearing about you and your exploits for a long time, soldier.  I look forward to fighting by your side in Redridge.$b$bYou are dismissed.</RewardText>
