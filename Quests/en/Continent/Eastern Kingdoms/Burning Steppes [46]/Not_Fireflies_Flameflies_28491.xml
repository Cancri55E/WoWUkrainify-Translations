  <Title>Not Fireflies, Flameflies</Title>
  <Description>Most of my fellow residents here at Flame Crest seem to have left at some point.  I guess the Burning Steppes weren't INTERESTING enough for them.$b$bNot me, though.  I'm always finding new reasons to not leave, and the latest happens to be the flameflies that have been appearing lately.$b$bThey appear near lava during the day.  By night, you'll find them almost anywhere.$b$bIf you wouldn't mind collecting some, I might be able to make it worth your while.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 7 Flameflies.</LogDescription>
