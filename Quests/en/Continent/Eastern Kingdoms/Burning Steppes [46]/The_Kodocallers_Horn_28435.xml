  <Title>The Kodocaller's Horn</Title>
  <Description>Alright, I've got some actual, legitimate, important work for you.  We've got to call the kodos in from the grazing lands to the south.  General Thorg'izog says we'll be moving out into Redridge soon, and I won't be caught with my kodos down.$b$bUse this horn near a kodo.  It will return to the camp when it hears the call.$b$bYou'll want to watch out.  Sometimes the kodos get a little feisty, so you need to knock them around a bit before they listen to you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Horn of the Callers to call 7 Blackrock War Kodos back to camp.  If a kodo turns hostile, fight it until it submits.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Your job is complete.  You take a look at the horn that they gave you, and decide to hang onto it for a while longer.</RewardText>
