Just act like you're supposed to be there, and you'll be fine.$b$bYour contact inside Black Tooth Hovel will be an orc by the name of Quartermaster Kaoshin.  He does NOT know you're a spy, so try and stay cool.$b$bDo whatever Kaoshin asks you.  Colonel Troteman will be in touch via gnomecorder to give you any special instructions.$b$bGood luck out there, soldier.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Quartermaster Kaoshin at the Black Tooth Hovel in Burning Steppes.</LogDescription>
