  <Title>Crushcog's Minions</Title>
  <Description>Our old enemy, Thermaplugg, is doing his best to keep us from rebuilding and finishing our reclamation of Gnomeregan. He's sent one of his most loyal henchmen, Razlo Crushcog, and a force of irradiated gnomes to harry us.$B$BThey've taken over an old arsenal up the road to the north, and Crushcog's technicians are repairing those weapons. We have to stop them before they're able to get those mechano-tanks back online. Go to Crushcog's Arsenal and eliminate as many of the technicians as you can.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 of Crushcog's Minions at Crushcog's Arsenal. You may kill Irradiated Technicians or Crushcog's Battle Suits.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That should set back Crushcog's plans a bit, but we can't rest until he is defeated and Chill Breeze Valley is secure.</RewardText>
