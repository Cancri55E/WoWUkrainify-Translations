  <Description>We've lost more than a couple scouts trying to find out what exactly Razlo Crushcog plans to do with all those mechano-tanks his irradiated technicians are repairing.$B$BWe can't afford to take it slowly anymore. We must act before Crushcog turns his followers and his weapons on us.$B$BThis techno-grenade packs enough explosive power to destroy the mechano-tanks and deny Crushcog their use. Take it north with you along the road to Crushcog's Arsenal and take out those tanks!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Techno-Grenade to destroy 5 Repaired Mechano-Tanks at Crushcog's Arsenal.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Mekkatorque will be pleased to hear that you've ruined Crushcog's plans to use our old weapons for his followers. Without the mechano-tanks under his command, he'll be weak and vulnerable.</RewardText>
