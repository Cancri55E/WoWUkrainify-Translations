  <Title>Paint it Black</Title>
  <Description>We have reliable intelligence that Razlo Crushcog has taken up a defensive position on the island in the middle of frozen Iceflow Lake. To make matters worse, he's surrounded himself with a network of sentry-bots that will detect any possible attackers.$B$BIf we're to take on Crushcog, we'll need to take out those sentries. This device launches a dark, sticky paint that will coat the optical sensors of Crushcog's sentry-bots. Use it to take out his early warning system.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Paintinator to blind 5 of Crushcog's Sentry-Bots.</LogDescription>
