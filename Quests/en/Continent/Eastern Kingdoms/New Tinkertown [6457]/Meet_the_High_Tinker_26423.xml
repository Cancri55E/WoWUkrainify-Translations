  <Title>Meet the High Tinker</Title>
  <Description>I don't know if you'll remember Mekkatorque or not. Nevin tells me that memory loss is pretty common for a Gnomeregan survivor.$B$BMekkatorque, or more properly, the High Tinker Mekkatorque is the leader of all the gnomes. He has made a habit of meeting with every rescued survivor personally. You should introduce yourself to him. He'll be with his war council beneath the tent in the center of town.</Description>
