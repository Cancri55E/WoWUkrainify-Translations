  <Title>Protecting the Herd</Title>
  <Description>We heard the cries in the middle of the night.  Then this morning, sure enough, the herd was missing two rams.  That dastardly beast known as Vagash has been preying on our livelihood.  With Ironforge's troops already spread thin, there is no one to keep Vagash at bay.$b$bPerhaps you are brave enough to seek out the beast and slay him.  Bring me one of his fangs and I will reward you.  Vagash lurks just above the ranch here, but be warned, he is deadly.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain Vagash's Fang.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Vagash still terrorizes the herd!  Please help us by killing the wretched beast.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Very well done!  Veron will be so happy when he hears the good news.  To kill Vagash is no easy task.  I imagine one day you'll be fighting alongside King Magni's men on the Alliance Front.</RewardText>
