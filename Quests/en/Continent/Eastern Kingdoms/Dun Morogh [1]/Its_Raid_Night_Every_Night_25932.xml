  <Title>It's Raid Night Every Night</Title>
  <Description>The reports I'm sending Captain Tharran can't really convey the amount of trouble the Frostmanes have created for us. Your assault on the village has started to relieve some of the pressure. The raids are still frequent, but the trolls don't have the numbers they once did.$B$BEven so, my men are tired and their morale is flagging. Would you help us keep watch for the Frostmane raiders? They could turn up at any time.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Sergeant Flinthammer and his mountaineers defend Amberstill Ranch from Frostmane Raiders.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>With your help, we've managed to weaken the raiders considerably. They haven't suffered such losses since the raids began. Now is the time to press our advantage.</RewardText>
