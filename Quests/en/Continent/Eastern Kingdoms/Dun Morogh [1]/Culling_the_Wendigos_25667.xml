  <Title>Culling the Wendigos</Title>
  <Description>The wendigos in the Grizzled Den to the southwest of town have long been a thorn in our side. They're never quite strong enough to threaten Kharanos directly, yet they prey on travelers, mountaineer patrols, and supply convoys.$B$BI'm going to be withdrawing my observers from the Grizzled Den because I need them on the troll front. Would you help my men finish culling the wendigo population? Without strength of numbers, they won't be able to attack us.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Wendigos in the Grizzled Den. You may kill Wendigos or Young Wendigos.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Now that you've dealt with the wendigos, we should be able to focus our efforts on the Frostmane trolls to the east.</RewardText>
