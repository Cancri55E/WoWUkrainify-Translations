  <Title>Frostmane Aggression</Title>
  <Description>The cataclysm has thrown the balance of power in Dun Morogh into question, $n. Without warning, a wave of troggs emerged from the caves near Gnomeregan and overran the Frostmane trolls. The trolls have been migrating east ever since.$B$BThere has always been a Frostmane presence up on Shimmer Ridge, to the northwest, but with the migration, the trolls now surround us. We can't allow the trolls to use this position to their advantage. While my men hold the line in the east, strike against Shimmer Ridge.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 5 Frostmane Seers and 7 Frostmane Snowstriders on Shimmer Ridge.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We should be able to focus our efforts on the rest of the trolls to the east, but there's still the matter of the wendigos in the Grizzled Den.</RewardText>
