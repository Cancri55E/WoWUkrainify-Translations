  <Title>Help for the Quarry</Title>
  <Description>Thank you again for all your help here, $n.$B$BI have a cousin who used to work in the mines beneath the Gol'Bolar Quarry, but he hasn't been able to work since troggs flooded into the mines and took control. The quarry and its camp are just to the southeast of the ranch. Would you be willing to check in with the foreman there and see if there's anything to be done?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Foreman Stonebrow at the Gol'Bolar Quarry.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Sergeant Flinthammer? I'm not familiar with the name, but, aye, there is a Flinthammer among the miners. He's one of the ones lucky enough to make it out of the mine, but most of my men are still trapped down there.</RewardText>
