They're angry, confused, and unwilling to hear my pleas.$B$BI have tried everything I know to calm them, to persuade them to stop lashing out and attacking the sergeant's mountaineers.$B$BIt pains me to say this, but no other options remain -- we must kill the elementals.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 6 Helm's Bed Surgers at Helm's Bed Lake.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It is never easy to countenance violence against the very elements whose powers I wield, but sometimes there is no other solution. Our duty to the people of Dun Morogh comes first.</RewardText>
