  <Title>Striking Back</Title>
  <Description>My chief engineer tells me that he's managed to get one of the bombers repaired and airworthy. Take these bombs with you, and look for the repaired bomber at the start of the runway.$B$BOnce you're airborne, use the bombs to do as much damage to the attacking Dark Iron dwarves as you can. I've heard rumors that they're preparing to deploy a new kind of war golem. Keep your eyes peeled for those golems and make them your highest priority targets.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Board the Repaired Bomber and use the Iron Hammer Bomb to kill 30 Dark Iron attackers. You may kill any of the Dark Iron dwarves or their allies at the Ironforge Airfield.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The momentum is starting to shift, $n, largely due to your efforts. Now, it is time to strike at the Dark Iron leadership.</RewardText>
