  <Title>Bound for Kharanos</Title>
  <Description>I was supposed to be bringing these casks of ale to the inn in Kharanos. They contain a mysterious new ale produced by an upstart brewery based in Brewnall Village. As I was leaving town, I was attacked by a Frostmane troll raiding party. It's going to take me days to repair the wagon!$B$BI don't suppose you'd be willing to do me a favor, will you? These big kegs aren't going anywhere, but I have some smaller sample casks. Would you bring them to Kharanos for me? Just follow the road to the southeast.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Sample Casks to Innkeeper Belm at the Thunderbrew Distillery in Kharanos.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Welcome, visitor. Have you come to the inn to rest, or do you need a new hearthstone?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These look promising. I've heard great things about the Short and Stout Brewery, but I haven't had the chance to try their ale until now.$B$BWhile you're here, relax a little. If you need a spare hearthstone or wish to make Kharanos your home, just speak to me and I'll be happy to help.</RewardText>
