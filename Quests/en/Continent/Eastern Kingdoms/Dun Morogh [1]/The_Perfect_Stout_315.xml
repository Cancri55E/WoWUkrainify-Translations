  <Title>The Perfect Stout</Title>
  <Description>I'm on a quest to make the perfect stout.  I know I can do it -- brewing's in my blood.  I just need to find the right recipe...$B$BThe Frostmane trolls grow a plant, shimmerweed, up on Shimmer Ridge to the northwest.  They use it in their strange, tribal rituals. We haven't found much use for it, but it has a unique taste... and I want to experiment with it in my brews!$B$BObtaining the shimmerweed will be dangerous, but I'll pay well for any you can "borrow" from the baskets in the troll village.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 7 Shimmerweeds to Rejold Barleybrew in Kharanos.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have that shimmerweed?  I almost have a batch of stout ready to brew, and I want to try throwing the weed in with this mixture.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Great!  I can't wait to use these in some of my recipes.  There's one in particular I think it'll work great in...</RewardText>
