  <Title>Forced to Watch from Afar</Title>
  <Description>The cataclysm drove the troggs to the surface in hordes, forcing the Frostmane trolls to flee for their lives. Unfortunately, they've decided to settle right on our doorstep and make trouble for us.$B$BI deployed Mountaineer Dunstan and his squad to the Grizzled Den just southwest of town to keep an eye on the wendigos that live there, but now I need to recall them to Kharanos. Find them and tell them to deploy those remote observation bots the gnomes provided, then return to Kharanos.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Relay Captain Tharran's orders to Mountaineer Dunstan, Mountaineer Lewin, and Mountaineer Valgrum in the Grizzled Den.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hey, $N.  Been to the Grizzled Den yet?  Those Wendigos can be fierce.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for your help, $n. Our forces are deployed thinly these days and three mountaineers could be the difference between defending Kharanos and being overrun.</RewardText>
