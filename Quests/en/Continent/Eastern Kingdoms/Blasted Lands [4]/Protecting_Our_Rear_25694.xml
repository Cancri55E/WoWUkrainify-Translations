  <Title>Protecting Our Rear</Title>
  <Description>The only reason you see me standing aside Alliance soldiers is because our duty outweighs our enmity... however slightly.  We have been charged with protecting the Dark Portal from unauthorized travel, and with the recent cataclysm, we are particularly susceptible to an attack.  We've already heard reports of black dragons in the area...$b$bWith my men focused on their duty, we need someone to keep the area demons in check.  Around the portal you will find three demon lieutenants.  Slay them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Jarroc Torn-wing, Shahandana, and Gomegaz.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You have not yet killed these demons.  $n!  Get back to the field!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Your work is appreciated, soldier.$b$b&lt;The warlord leans in close, and whispers:&gt;$b$b$R... if you're still interested, I have one more small task for you...</RewardText>
