  <Title>Nethergarde Reigns</Title>
  <Description>Lungertz is a strong leader, but he is proud.  He understates the pressure that the Horde is really putting on us.  Without our mine... Nethergarde is penniless.$b$bWe need to move the Horde forces from the supply camp NOW, and doing so means killing their commander, Captain Metlek.  He's not a strong leader, and prefers to bark orders from the back lines, but even so, his death might buy us the victory we need.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Captain Metlek at the Nethergarde Supply Camp.</LogDescription>
