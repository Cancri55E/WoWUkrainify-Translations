  <Title>The Demons and the Druid</Title>
  <Description>The Reliquary is focused on the acquisition and preservation of magical artifacts.  Our particular excursion is focused on the demonic artifacts that are hidden in what used to be the Tainted Scar.$b$bA worgen druid has taken residence in the scar and is coaxing a forest to grow.  He seems to be failing, however, as the area is still infested with demons.$b$bAnyhow, his forest stands in the way of our excursion, as do these demons.  Slay the tainted ones, then return to me so we might deal with the druid.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 5 Doomguard Destroyers, 5 Dreadlord Defilers, 5 Corrupted Darkwood Treants, and 3 Felspore Bog Lords in the Tainted Forest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The forest is not yet cleared of the taint, $n.  Do as I say, and then we may proceed with our mission.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $n.$b$bI should be a bit more up-front with you.  The demons were a nuisance, but they are not the real problem.  That worgen druid is our problem.</RewardText>
