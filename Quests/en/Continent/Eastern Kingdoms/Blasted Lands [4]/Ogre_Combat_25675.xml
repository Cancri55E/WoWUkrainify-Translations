  <Title>Ogre Combat</Title>
  <Description>I saw your handiwork down there, $r.  How'd you like to hunt some more ogres?$b$bWe only enslaved the ones we could catch.  Most of the strongest ogres still brood in Dreadmaul Post, plotting our demise.  Our guards can handle the scattered ambushers, but we are not yet firmly entrenched, and will buckle quickly under a coordinated attack.$b$bGo south to Dreadmaul Post and send a message, $n.  Slay the strongest before they get any ideas.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 6 Dreadmaul Maulers and 5 Dreadmaul Warlocks.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The less we have to worry about ogres, the more we can focus on our true mission here.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You've done well today, $n.  Not only have you purchased more time before the next ogre attack, but I think you scared some of the captives into working harder.</RewardText>
