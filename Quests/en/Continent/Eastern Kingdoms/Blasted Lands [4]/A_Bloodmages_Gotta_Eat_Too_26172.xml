  <Title>A Bloodmage's Gotta Eat Too</Title>
  <Description>Contrary to popular belief, ancient and powerful bloodmages do NOT drink blood.  We eat normal food like everybody else - something which can be hard to come by in the recesses of a hostile cultist stronghold.$b$bThe ashmane boars in the central valley of the Blasted Lands are, if nothing else, convenient for eating, as their meat does not require any cooking.  Would you hunt these boars and help me replenish my ever-dwindling foodstores?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 5 Ashmane Steaks from Ashmane Boars in the Blasted Lands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I'm famished!  If you don't hurry, I might actually resort to drinking our reagents.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These are perfect, $n.  I will eat well for the next several days.</RewardText>
