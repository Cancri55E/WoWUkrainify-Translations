  <Title>It's All Mine</Title>
  <Description>All over this cavern you'll find unguarded piles of ore, just waiting to be tampered with.  Our first choice would be to steal the ore, obviously, but that requires mine carts, protection, and labor... three things we just don't have.  So instead, we're just going to ruin this little mining party with a little bit of highly corrosive solvent.$b$bTake this bottle - CAREFULLY - and pour it onto those heaps of ore.  'Cause if we can't have this ore, then neither can they.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Concentrated Solvent on 6 Ore Heaps in the Nethergarde Mines.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I wouldn't store that solvent where I store my potions, if I were you.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There's nothing quite like a big fat kick in the wallet, is there, you Alliance lunkheads?!</RewardText>
