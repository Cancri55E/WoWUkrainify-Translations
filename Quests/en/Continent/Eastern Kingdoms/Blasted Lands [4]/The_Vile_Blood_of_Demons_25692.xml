  <Title>The Vile Blood of Demons</Title>
  <Description>Thalipedes wants demon blood.  Personally, the stuff doesn't even seem like blood to me - more like liquid rot - but that's neither here nor there.$b$bLuckily for you, the area around the Dark Portal is crawling with demons.  Infernals, felhounds, felguards... they've all got what you need, in copious, pustulent amounts.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 7 bottles of Vile Demonic Blood.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Ugh, what's that smell?  Is that you, or the blood?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There's no doubt about it, you found demon blood.$b$bLoramus' requests aside, I'm sure Dar'toon is thankful for your efforts.  They've been struggling to deal with these demon distractions for some time now.</RewardText>
