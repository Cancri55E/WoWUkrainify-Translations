  <Title>Cultists at our Doorstep</Title>
  <Description>You may have already run into some of the Shadowsworn cultists that dwell in the caves just to the southwest of Nethergarde.  They do not impress an immediate danger upon our fortress, but I fear that they are planning something more dreadful than you can imagine.$b$bThe low-ranking members carry spell foci that might hold an answer.  Bring some back to me intact, if you can wrench them from the cultists' hands.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 6 Intact Shadowsworn Spell Foci from Shadowsworn Spellblades and Shadowsworn Occultists in the Blasted Lands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The cultists will not part easily with their foci.  Slay them quickly before they suspect our intent.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ably done, $n.  Now we see if my suspicions are correct.$b$b&lt;The watcher selects a spell focus and focuses intently on its shadows.  After a moment, he turns back to you with a look of horror on his face.&gt;</RewardText>
