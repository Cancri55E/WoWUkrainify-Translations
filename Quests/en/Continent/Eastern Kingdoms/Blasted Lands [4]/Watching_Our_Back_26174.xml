  <Title>Watching Our Back</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Watch Commander Relthorn Netherwane speaks in hushed tones.&gt;$b$bI have orders from... higher up... that you would be suitable for.  I've seen the Horde periodically referring to a stack of papers on that barrel over there.  I'd like you to take a look at those papers and find out what it is that they're plotting.  My duty and station prevent me from such a questionable task, but a newcomer like you might be able to slip in unnoticed...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Examine the Horde Plans at the Dark Portal without getting caught.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You're certain nobody saw you?  Good.$b$b&lt;Netherwane listens to your recount of the information you saw.&gt;$b$bHmph... fairly harmless stuff.  Either the Horde are foolish enough to NOT be planning something against us... or they're hiding their information better than I expected.  Either way, well done, soldier.</RewardText>
