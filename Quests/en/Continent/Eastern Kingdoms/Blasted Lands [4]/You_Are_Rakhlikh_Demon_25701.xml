  <Title>You Are Rakh'likh, Demon</Title>
  <Description>Hero, listen well.$b$bFirst, we must travel to the Deathly Usher, who waits at the northern foot of the Rise of the Defiler, to our northeast.  The usher will take us to the top of the rise.  Once there, I need you to help me defeat Razelikh, for I fear that I am not strong enough to defeat him alone.$b$bMost importantly, I need you to hold the stone knife, and do not use it until I tell you to.  The knife will trap Razelikh's soul within its new, eternal prison.$b$bIf we succeed, speak with Wazzik.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>Your knowledge of his true name shall prove to be his undoing.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Speak with the Deathly Usher north of the Rise of the Defiler.  Once atop the Rise, destroy Razelikh's body, then use the Stone Knife of Sealing to imprison his soul.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I see.  So this was Loramus' plan all along.$b$bI suspected correctly, but I suppose I refused to believe it.  And now, his final instruction for me makes much more sense:$b$bHe asked me to let you choose from one of these.</RewardText>
