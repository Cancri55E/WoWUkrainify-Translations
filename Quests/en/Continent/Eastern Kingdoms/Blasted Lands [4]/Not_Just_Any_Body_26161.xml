  <Title>Not Just Any Body</Title>
  <Description>We need Loramus Thalipedes, the demon hunter.  He knows Razelikh's true name, and as you know: if you know the name of the demon, you have power over it.  The problem is that Loramus has been killed, and his body torn apart.$b$bIf you bring me the pieces, we still have a recourse.  All three pieces are in the west... the Dreadmaul ogres hide them in their caves.  Move quickly, for much like Grimeo, Loramus also owes me a debt...</Description>
