  <Title>Advice from the Cenarion Circle</Title>
  <Description>I believe that the taint of the Blasted Lands has finally exerted its influence over my friend Wormthorn.  His experiment has failed, and his great-tree now only serves as a focus for the demons to rally around.$b$bThe tree must come down, and Wormthorn with it.  Speak with the Cenarion Observer on the other side of town; she should have some idea how to proceed.$b$b$n: the act we are about to commit must not be made known to the townspeople of Surwich.  Morale is low enough as-is.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Report to Cenarion Observer Shayana at the Surwich in the Blasted Lands.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>While I'm surprised that Connisport is willing to go forward with his plan, I'm also relieved.  I've seen the demons rallying around Maldraz, and I share his fears.</RewardText>
