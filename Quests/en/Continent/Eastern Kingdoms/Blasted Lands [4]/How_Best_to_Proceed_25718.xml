  <Title>How Best to Proceed</Title>
  <Description>Your demon-slaying down there bought our scouts enough time to get a good look at that druid.  My intelligence tells me that his name is Marl Wormthorn... a rogue Gilnean druid of substantial power.  He resides in Maldraz, the large, twisted tree at the center of the forest, and is protected from harm by some strange force.  Whether that force is of demonic or natural sources, we have yet to determine.$b$bSpeak with Elijah.  He may have some more information for you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Report to Elijah Dawnflight at the Sunveil Excursion in the Blasted Lands.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Rohan's sending YOU to slay his druid?  Very well.$b$bYou should know: Marl Wormthorn is as much demon as he is druid.  Even a druid of his power doesn't have a chance against the demonic energies that run so deeply through this land.  That does not, however, make him any less of an obstacle.</RewardText>
