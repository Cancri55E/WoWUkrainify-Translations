  <Title>The Vile Blood of Demons</Title>
  <Description>Sharim wants demon blood.  Speaking personally, the stuff does not even seem like blood to me - more like liquid rot - but that is of no consequence.$b$bLuckily for you, the area around the Dark Portal is crawling with demons.  Infernals, felhounds, felguards... they've all got what you need, in copious, pustulent amounts.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 7 bottles of Vile Demonic Blood.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Ugh, what's that smell?  Is that you, or the blood?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There is no doubt about it, you have found demon blood.$b$bKasim's requests aside, I am sure that my Watch Commander is thankful for your efforts.  They have been struggling to deal with these demon distractions for some time now.</RewardText>
