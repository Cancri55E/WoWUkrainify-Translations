  <Title>Blasted Lands: The Other Side of the World</Title>
  <Description>Now here's an interesting one.  It says that members of the Horde should talk to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold.$B$BHmph! I didn't even know that the Horde held Dreadmaul Hold!$b$bI guess this Okrilla requires help fighting some ogres and the Alliance.
