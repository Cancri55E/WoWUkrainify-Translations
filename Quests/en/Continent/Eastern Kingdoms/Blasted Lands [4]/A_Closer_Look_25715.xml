  <Title>A Closer Look</Title>
  <Description>We've seen countless ships sail past the shore to the southeast, but most pass by inconspicuously.  Several days ago, however, a powerful storm carried several of the ships to shore and left them wrecked.$b$bI'd bet a pint of Nethergarde Bitter that they were Horde ships if I didn't love Nethergarde Bitter so much.  I can pay you gold, though, if you'll go check out those ships and report back.</Description>

  <RewardText>You saw worgen?  That's bad.$b$bWorgen ghosts?  That's even worse.$b$bThose weren't Horde ships... they were Gilnean.  And they must have been headed down to Surwich, at the bottom of the Tainted Forest.  That makes a lot more sense.$b$bWe've got to try to help them, $n!  The worgen are our allies!</RewardText>
