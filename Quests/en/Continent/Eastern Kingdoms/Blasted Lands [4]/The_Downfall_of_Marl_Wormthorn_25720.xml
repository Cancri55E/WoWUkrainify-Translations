  <Title>The Downfall of Marl Wormthorn</Title>
  <Description>Wormthorn's unnatural forest threatens our excursion's progress.  His trees' roots break our picks, his moss grows over our excavation sites, and his animals attack my men.  When it comes to digging, I'll take a demon-infested wasteland over a forest any day.$b$bTake the demoniac vessel and use it on Marl Wormthorn to pull him from his trance.  Return to me when he is no more.</Description>

  <CompletionText>I haven't time for this, $n.  You came here for a reason, and it wasn't to chat.  Get back to work.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hopefully, with this druid out of the picture, we can get back to our digging.  The world is full of powerful artifacts, $n.  You just need to be willing to do what it takes to get to them.$b$bFeel free to take one of these.  The Reliquary is always happy to share some of its trove with fellow members of the Horde.</RewardText>
