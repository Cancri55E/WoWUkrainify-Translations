  <Title>Demoniac Vessel</Title>
  <Description>We need a way to get Wormthorn's attention.  Something to break him out of his trance.  Something that's guaranteed to work.$b$bThe few types of wildlife that managed to make a foothold in the Tainted Forest are, without a doubt, affected by the land's latent energies.  Your task is to collect their body parts and find a way to combine them into a vessel.  If Wormthorn's trance is druidic, or even if it is demonic, a large enough vessel of tainted animal flesh should be able to break it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill the Tainted Black Bears, Tainted Nightstalkers, and Tainted Screechers in the Tainted Forest, and try to assemble their parts into a Demoniac Vessel.</LogDescription>
