  <Title>Gar'mak Bladetwist</Title>
  <Description>With the intelligence you have gathered we have learned this assault is being led by a powerful Iron Horde orc named Gar'mak Bladetwist. He is hunkered down inside Okril'lon Hold.$b$bKilling him will not win this war, but it will surely break down the Iron Horde's communication. This will buy us valuable time while we gather more forces and outline a battleplan to deal with this new threat.</Description>
