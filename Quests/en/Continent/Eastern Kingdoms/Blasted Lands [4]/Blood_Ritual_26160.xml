  <Title>Blood Ritual</Title>

Here's the short version - a version at which I happen to be an expert:$b$bThe Shadowsworn cultists wish to summon the demon, Razelikh, back to the Blasted Lands.  We cannot allow this to happen.  So we're going to summon him ourselves, and then kill him.  A task not as simple as it sounds...$b$bLet me know when you are ready to begin the blood ritual, and then stand back.</Description>
