  <Title>Wormthorn's Dream</Title>
  <Description>Not surprisingly, most of our citizens in Surwich did not come to the Blasted Lands for the pleasant atmosphere.  They came following the dream of an idealistic druid: Marl Wormthorn.  Wormthorn believed that the Tainted Scar could be healed, and attempted to grow it back.$b$bIt looks like he was wrong.  He grew his forest, but the land is still plagued by demons, and his great-tree is twisted and gnarled.$b$bI'm still hopeful.  Maybe if we head into the Tainted Forest and clear out some of the taint...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 5 Doomguard Destroyers, 5 Dreadlord Defilers, 5 Corrupted Darkwood Treants, and 3 Felspore Bog Lords in the Tainted Forest.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You say the demons were all worshipping the tree?$b$b&lt;The mayor sighs.&gt;$b$bIt is as I feared, then.</RewardText>
