  <Description>The dark blade of Sargeras has cast a shadow of destruction over this land.

It seemed that the silithid hives were destroyed in the attack, but I have received reports that the silithid are returning.

We need to find out how the silithid avoided destruction and what effect the blade is having on their hives.

The crown wants the surviving silithid dissected and studied. 

Tammy Tinkspinner is conducting the research and is in need of a "collector."</Description>
