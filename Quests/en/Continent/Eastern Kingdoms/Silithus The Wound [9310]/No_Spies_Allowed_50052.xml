  <Description>Hey $n, I'm glad you're here.

I'm in way over my head! Killer bugs, a strange substance... that GIANT sword sticking outta the ground... I don't have a good feelin' about this place!

To make matters worse, I've been gettin' reports of Alliance spies snoopin' around the camp!

Get over to the mining camp and take out those SI:7 spies before they ruin the whole operation!</Description>
