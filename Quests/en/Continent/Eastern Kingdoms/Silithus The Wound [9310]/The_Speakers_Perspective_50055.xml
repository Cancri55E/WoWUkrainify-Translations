  <Title>The Speaker's Perspective</Title>
  <Description>Sargeras has left a scar upon our world, $n. A scar that will not soon heal...

It appears that the scars between the Alliance and Horde have yet to heal as well.

Too many lives have already been lost fighting to save Azeroth from destruction. I will not stay and watch this world lose more.

I have a request for you before I go. Take this letter to Magni Bronzebeard. He is in Silithus seeking a way to heal the wound.

The letter contains information that may prove valuable to him.</Description>
