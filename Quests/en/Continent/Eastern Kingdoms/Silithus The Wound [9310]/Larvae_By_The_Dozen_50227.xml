  <Title>Larvae By The Dozen</Title>
  <Description>How did the silithid survive the blade of Sargeras? I'm perplexed!

I've never encountered a species that can adapt to changes in the environment as quickly as the silithid can.

The larvae, or broodlings as they are often called, can evolve into a variety of silithid creature types based on the needs of the hive.

Is it the hive mind that signals the evolutionary development of the larvae, or is some environmental factor at play?

Science must find the answer!</Description>
