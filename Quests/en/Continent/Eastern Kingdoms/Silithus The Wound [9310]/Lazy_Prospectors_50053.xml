  <Title>Lazy Prospectors!</Title>
  <Description>I've been around long enough to know you can never trust a goblin with an orc's work.

Gallywix and his cartel may be serving the warchief, but we need to keep a close eye on them if we're going to get anything done!

I've already noticed many of the workers loafing about and sleeping on the job. The Horde does not tolerate laziness!

Get out there and put those lazy prospectors in their place!</Description>
