  <Title>The Source of Power</Title>
  <Description>The silithid are all riled up and stronger than ever!

My guess is that they are feeding off of some kind of power beneath the ground. Probably near the blade of Sargeras!

I've been ordered to study the effects that this mysterious power is having on the sillithid.

Bring me as many intact silithid brains as you can carry and I'll begin the research!</Description>
