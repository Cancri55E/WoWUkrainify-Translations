  <Title>It's a Sabotage</Title>
  <Description>The Horde has wasted no time in shamelessly extracting this mysterious ore from the great wound.

Luckily for us, goblin engineering is not nearly as sophisticated as what we create in Gnomeregan! All it takes is a little bit of old fashioned dynamite to completely disable a goblin shredder.

What unsophisticated machinery!

Take these dynamite bundles and plant them on the inactive shredders around the mining camp.

It'll take those greedy goblins weeks to get back up and running again!</Description>
