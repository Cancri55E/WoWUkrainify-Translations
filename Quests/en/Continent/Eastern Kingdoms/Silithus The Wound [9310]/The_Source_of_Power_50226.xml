  <Title>The Source of Power</Title>
  <Description>Although the silithid disappeared for a time immediately following the destruction of Silithus, they have recently returned from beneath the ground.

These new silithid seem stronger than before!

My hypothesis is that the silithid are feeding on some kind of power source beneath the blade of Sargeras.

I've been tasked with studying the effects that this mysterious power is having on the silithid hives.

Bring me as many intact silithid brains as you can carry and I'll begin the research!</Description>
