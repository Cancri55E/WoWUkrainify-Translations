  <Title>Larvae By The Dozen</Title>
  <Description>How did the silithid survive the blade of Sargeras?!

I've never encountered a species that can adapt to changes in the environment as quickly as the silithid!

There's gotta be a way to tame these suckers! Harness their evolutionary biology for our profit!

We gotta start training 'em young! Forget about the old crusty adults, we need babies!

Steal me as many of the silithid larvae as you can carry, and I'll find a way to train 'em!</Description>
