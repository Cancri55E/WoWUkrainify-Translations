  <Title>The Twilight Survivor</Title>
  <Description>Silithus used to be overrun with members of the Twilight's Hammer.

The cult was presumed to be exterminated, but it has always survived in the shadows. Their numbers have dwindled, but the cult remains no less fanatical than at their peak.

Most of the cultists here were destroyed by Sargeras in the attack, but a few still remain. Their leader, Michiel Voidstrider has been emboldened by the destruction of Silithus.

We cannot let Michiel rally the remaining survivors to action. He must be stopped!</Description>
