  <Description>Can you believe it?  We have an actual functioning arcane sanctum up and running southeast of here: the Sanctum of the Sun.  All manner of important magisters have come to take part in running it.$B$BOf course they've all forgotten about the Sanctum of the Moon.  Not much remains of it and its energies have given rise to bizarre creatures.$B$BI'm not one to let good resources go to waste, however.  Go to the Sanctum of the Moon and see if you can recover the crystallized essences from the creatures there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Magister Darenis wants you to travel to the Sanctum of the Moon to the west of Tranquillien and recover 8 Crystallized Mana Essences from the Arcane Devourers and Mana Shifters that inhabit the structure.</LogDescription>
