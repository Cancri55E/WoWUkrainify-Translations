I'm sure he'll send help back as soon as he can.</Description>

  <RewardText>That's dire news indeed -- I completely overestimated Tomathren's ability to lead. I'll see to it that a group is dispatched to safely bring him and Valanna back in.$B$BUnfortunately, we never heard from Ranger Salissa, so I fear the worst in her case.$B$BYou've done the Farstriders a great service this day, $c. Please take one of these as a small token of our appreciation.</RewardText>
