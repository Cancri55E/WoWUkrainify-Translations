  <Title>Assault on Zeb'Nowa</Title>
  <Description>Time for something a little more challenging. Zeb'Nowa, to the south, is where the more powerful Shadowpine trolls make their home. In our continuing effort to keep the troll numbers to a minimum I'm dispatching you to go down there and assail them by whatever means you have at your disposal.$B$BWhat do you say, $n? Ready to deal with some more trolls?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Shadowpine Catlords and 10 Shadowpine Hexxers, and return to Farstrider Solanna at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is your assault on Zeb'Nowa complete already?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Unbelievable! You really should talk to the captain about joining up as a Farstrider.$B$BAlright, $N, you've given us the breathing room that we need to continue building up our forces here. Actually, by your account there aren't many of those trolls left at all! Maybe now we can join with Tranquillien and attack Deatholme?$B$BI think you've earned a little something. Take your pick.</RewardText>
