  <Title>Investigate An'daroth</Title>
  <Description>$C, we are having difficulty with a group of night elves that have recently taken over a nearby island. They've set up a small camp at the old high elf ley-line nexus, An'daroth, to the northwest. There is a dirt path that leads up to it just past the Dead Scar.$B$BI suggest that you lend us your aid by going there, investigating what they are up to, and slaying as many of the conceited night elves as you can.</Description>
  <AreaDescription>Investigate An'daroth</AreaDescription>
  <LogDescription>Investigate the area at An'daroth, kill 12 Sentinel Spies and then return to Dame Auriferous at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>$C. what word do you bring concerning An'daroth and what the night elves were up to there?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Disappointing that the night elves' plans were not readily apparent at An'daroth. However, those objects that looked like small magically-grown trees with powered orbs atop them sound interesting. It would appear that we'll need to be more direct in our information gathering efforts.$B$BHere, take this coin and these potions. I believe that you'll have use for them before we're done dealing with these night elves.</RewardText>
