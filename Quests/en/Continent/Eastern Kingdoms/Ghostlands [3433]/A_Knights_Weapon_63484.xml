  <Title>A Knight's Weapon</Title>
  <Description>It's clear that this san'layn has decided to use the Scourge to empower himself somehow. We can keep taking him out, but he will just keep coming back.

We need a weapon that can break him for good.

I think I have a solution. Upstairs, you will find a newly forged ranseur. It has yet to be tempered with magic--we will need to unlock its full potential. It will be our instrument of the Light.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect the Ranseur from upstairs in Tranquillien.</LogDescription>
