  <Title>Culinary Crunch</Title>
  <Description>This is intolerable!  I have nothing to work with here! Milady asks me to come from Silvermoon City; she deserves cuisine as befits her station.  No?  But I get here and there is no food.  You must go out, $c, and bring back fresh kills so that I have something to prepare.$B$BDame Auriferous prefers a crunchy texture to her food.  There are plenty of spindleweb lurkers to the southwest on the other side of the Dead Scar.  Disgusting, I know, but that's what we have to work with.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 5 Crunchy Spider Legs and return them to Master Chef Mouldier at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I believe I can hear the dame's belly rumbling even from here!  I take it that you are here talking to me because you have what I asked you to obtain?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Very well, these will have to do.  No, don't describe them crawling around, I don't want to know!  I'll work my magic upon these legs and they'll turn out quite tasty.  A little spice here, a pinch of herb there, and then of course some arcane ingredients, and voila, a meal fit for a queen... or in this case, a dame.$B$BYour service has been adequate, $c.  Here, take this recipe and some samples.</RewardText>
