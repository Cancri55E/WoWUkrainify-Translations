  <RewardText>It was just horrible! Night elves! They conjured their moon crystal here for some nefarious plot, but I snuck away and gathered a larger group of our scouts and casters from the nearby Sanctum of the Sun.

It's not safe out here!$B$BGive me a moment and I'll read through these plans to see what the night elves are up to.</RewardText>
