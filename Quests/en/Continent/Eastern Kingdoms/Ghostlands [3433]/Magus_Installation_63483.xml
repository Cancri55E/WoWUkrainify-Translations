  <Description>This is no mindless strike... I have a strong suspicion that some powerful entity is manipulating the Scourge.

Ever since the Helm of Domination was shattered, there has been a conceivable risk that someone else could exert their will and assume control over the undead--at least temporarily.

Rommath and I can help defend Tranquillien, but we need to break those lines. 

Clear a spot for us. Let us see if we can draw out their leader.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Aethas and Rommath set up defenses in Tranquillien.</LogDescription>
