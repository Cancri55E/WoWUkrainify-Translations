  <Title>A Little Dash of Seasoning</Title>
  <Description>I'm on loan to the Farstriders in an attempt to help with their troll difficulties. I believe that I have a solution to their problem.$B$BAt my disposal are a number of potent poisons. The trolls, as you know, are living creatures and therefore must eat. If we combine my poison with their food... well, I'm sure that the results will be entertaining!$B$BCare to help rid us of the Shadowpine trolls at Zeb'Nowa to the south? The camp straddles both the north and south sides of the road to Zul'Aman.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Poison the Troll foodstuff at the camps in Zeb'Nowa and then return to Apothecary Venustus at the Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Isn't this exciting? I really do take great pride in my work; I hope you appreciate it, $c.$B$BSo, I trust that you have 'seasoned' the food at the troll camps in Zeb'Nowa?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah, excellent! I knew that a $r-delivery system would make for the most efficient application of the poison. With any luck the Shadowpine trolls will get fat on it before keeling over. That should get them off of the backs of the Farstriders, and me back to Tranquillien.$B$BIt has been a pleasure working with you, $c!</RewardText>
