  <Title>Troll Juju</Title>
  <Description>The corpses of trolls buried inside the Amani Catacombs have been rising from the dead! I want you to go there and bring back proof of their final demise. Some of these mummy trolls, and their living counterparts, carry juju; glowing objects that house an unknown power source.  It's probably what is animating them!$B$BThe catacombs lie within Sungraze Peak, directly to the east. I am told that the easiest way in lies on the north face of the mountain. See to it, $c!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 Troll Juju and return them to Apothecary Venustus at Farstrider Enclave in the Ghostlands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I don't have to remind you that we can ill afford this trouble with the troll dead rising in our very backyard! We have enough trouble with Deatholme to the south!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Mummies being raised by troll priests... clever! The Shadowpine trolls must be trying to bolster their numbers through necromantic means. I'd wager that these oracles were using the juju in their reanimation ritual.$B$BOnce again you perform your duty as befits a $C of your growing reputation. Take this with our gratitude.</RewardText>
