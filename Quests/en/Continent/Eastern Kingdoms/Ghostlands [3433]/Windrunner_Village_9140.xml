  <CompletionText>$C, has Windrunner Village been liberated? Those damned magisters at the Sanctum of the Sun have been berating me to get their hands on those Scourge remnants I asked you to gather.$B$BDon't worry about that, though. You take your time and get the job done right. I'll deal with the magisters.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You've done it, $N. You've broken the Scourge hold on the three villages! Now we can focus our forces with greater ease against the Scourge on the Dead Scar and south at Deatholme.$B$BHere, take your choice of any one of these. I trust that you're not going anywhere? We can really use your continued assistance!</RewardText>
