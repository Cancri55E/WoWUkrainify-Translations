  <Title>Trouble at the Underlight Mines</Title>
  <Description>The Underlight Mines to the southwest have been overrun by a clan of gnolls calling themselves the Blackpaw. I don't need to remind you how important those mines are to us as a strategic asset in our ongoing campaign here in the Ghostlands!$B$BTake the south road out of town and follow the fork to the right. Just past the ziggurat on the right there will be a short dirt path to the west. Follow it.$B$BThe ore must flow!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 8 Blackpaw Gnolls, 6 Blackpaw Scavengers and 4 Blackpaw Shaman, and return to Deathstalker Maltendis at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is it good news, or bad, darling?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That's a fair job of butchery you managed there, $c. We'll get the miners back to work now. I'm sure they'll be disappointed that their break is over, but there's armor and weaponry to be made, and that requires ore to be mined.$B$BHere, take this as payment for doing your duty. Go get your armor and weapons repaired, and have a drink on me.</RewardText>
