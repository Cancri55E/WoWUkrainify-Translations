  <Title>Goldenmist Village</Title>
  <Description>We've had one success, but there are two more villages that must be reclaimed!$B$BGoldenmist Village is our next target. It lies to the northwest, and has been taken by the ghosts of the high elves that used to live there. Gruesome, I know, but these are apparently the sorts of tactics that the Scourge like to employ.$B$BGo and defeat these ghosts and wraiths, $c. Take the west road out of Tranquillien to get there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat 6 Quel'dorei Ghosts and 4 Quel'dorei Wraiths at Goldenmist Village, and then return to Arcanist Vandril at Tranquillien in the Ghostlands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I've learned much about fighting the Scourge in the time that I've been here. They can be beaten back, but it must be done in small steps. The obscene manner in which they can take your fallen and add them to their own ranks as the newly risen makes it imperative that you make no mistakes along the way.$B$BNow, how goes the fight against Goldenmist Village?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Your success at Goldenmist Village takes us another step closer to taking our land back. Don't fool yourself though, $c; this fight is far from over.$B$BHere, you've more than earned this. You may need it when you go up against Windrunner Village.</RewardText>
