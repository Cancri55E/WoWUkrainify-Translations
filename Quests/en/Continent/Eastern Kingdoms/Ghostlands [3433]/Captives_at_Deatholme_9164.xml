  <Description>Ah, yes. I possess a draught that will break most forms of alchemically induced stupor.$B$BSide effects include confusion, nausea and - in rare cases - temporary blindness. All much preferable to whatever the Scourge plans to do to those prisoners in Deatholme, if you ask me.$B$BBest of luck, brave $c. You are going to need it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take Janeda's Restorative Draught to Deatholme and rescue Apprentice Varnis, Apothecary Enith and Ranger Vedoran.  Return to Arcanist Janeda at the Sanctum of the Sun for a reward.</LogDescription>
