  <Title>Deactivate An'owyn</Title>
  <Description>Their moon crystals are scrying devices -- they're going to spy on us! I know that An'daroth can't provide enough power for that, but An'owyn, directly to the south, most definitely can!$B$BFrom the plans I now have a basic knowledge of how these moon crystals work; enough to shut them down. They're keyed so that they can be turned off. You must go to An'owyn, retrieve the controlling orb from one of the night elves and then use it on the moon crystal to stop them from enacting their plan!$B$BHurry, $c!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve the Crystal Controlling Orb and then use it to deactivate the Night Elf Moon Crystal at An'owyn. Then return to Magister Sylastor at An'telas in the Ghostlands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is it over then, $c? Did you deactivate the night elf moon crystal at An'owyn?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That's a relief, $c! I can assure you that if you hadn't deactivated those scrying orbs we would be in a more tenuous position than the one we're already in! To think, surrounded by enemies, and one of them able to spy upon our every move!$B$BBut now we don't need to worry about that thanks to you! Here, take this, I want you to be rewarded for your efforts and I just happen to have a few things here that I no longer have any use for.$B$BThank you again, $N!</RewardText>
