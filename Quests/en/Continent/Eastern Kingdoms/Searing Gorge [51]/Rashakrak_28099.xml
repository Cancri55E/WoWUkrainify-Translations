  <Title>Rasha'krak</Title>
  <Description>Based on this information you've delivered, I believe that one of this "Archduke's" minions may already have turned its eyes toward Thorium Point.$b$bHis name is Rasha'krak, and he patrols the lava pools just to our south.  He looks like the latent fire elementals that rage nearby, except for one small difference: the bracers of binding that encircle his wrists.$b$bFind him and bring these bracers to me, $n.  I need proof that we are in danger before we involve ourselves in elemental wars.</Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>Rasha'krak</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>He patrols the entrance to Thorium Point.  What does he want?</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Obtain Rasha'krak's Bracers of Binding.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I won't fight any elementals until we have proven that they pose a threat to us.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It is, unfortunately, as I expected.  These bracers bear the indelible mark of the firelord and his minions.$b$bVery well.  With no Horde or Alliance forces anywhere near this godforsaken gorge, it falls upon the Thorium Brotherhood to stop this Archduke before he spreads any more of his evil.</RewardText>
