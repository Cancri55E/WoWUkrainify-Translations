  <Title>Out of Place</Title>
  <Description>The gorge is an unforgiving place.  We don't get a whole lot of fuzzy wildlife wandering around here.$b$bWe tried bringing in some wild game, but they haven't fared well at all.  There's just no food for them to eat.  Now the nearby spiders - which were already dangerous - are getting big and fat on chicken meat.$b$bWe'll never get rid of all the spiders, but we can salvage what few chickens remain.  Not only will you be feeding the Brotherhood, you'll be saving them a painful death by spider bite.</Description>
