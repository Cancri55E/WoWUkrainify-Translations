  <Title>They Build a Better Bullet</Title>
  <Description>Those gorge-digging dwarves do at least one thing right: they make very high-quality bullets.  I've been unable to reproduce their results, so I've taken to stealing whatever bullets of theirs that I can find.$b$bYe want my help?  Get me a couple hundred bullets from those marksmen below.$b$bI'm sure they'll be happy to give ye their bullets one at a time, but you might find it faster just to look for the crates filled with them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 200 Dark Iron Bullets.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>A real $c woulda caught the bullets with $g his: her; teeth.</CompletionText>
