  <Description>I got one more assignment for ye.  This one comes straight down from the Overseer himself.  Seems he was pretty shook up once he heard about that "Archduke" ye discovered.$b$bHe's asked for us to hunt down three Twilight ministers that work over in Firewatch Ridge, to the west.  Kiyuubi, Letherio, and Finister are their names, and they each carry some sort o' special rock.  Combine all three and bring 'em back here.$b$bListen, when the Overseer gives orders, ye don't ask questions.  Ye just do it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain Kiyuubi's Spherule, Letherio's Spherule, and Finister's Spherule, then combine them into a Twilight Tripetricine.</LogDescription>
