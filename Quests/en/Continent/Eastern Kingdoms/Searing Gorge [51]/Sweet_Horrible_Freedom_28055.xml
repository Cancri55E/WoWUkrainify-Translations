  <Title>Sweet, Horrible Freedom</Title>
  <Description>Of course, we'll want to free as many slaves as we can while we're here.  Most of them will likely join forces with us, anxious to fight against their captors.$b$bHowever, sometimes you will find that slaves are resistant to being freed.  It's a strange phenomenon, often called "Durnholde Syndrome".$b$bEither way, you should try to free them.  If they resist, treat them as enemies.  Report your results to Evonice Sootsmoker, deeper within the Slag Pit.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Free 12 Slave Workers.  If they resist, kill them.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Strange how so many slaves cope poorly with freedom.  It's a shame to have to do what we do, but such are the truths of war.$b$bNow, we must move on to more pressing tasks.</RewardText>
