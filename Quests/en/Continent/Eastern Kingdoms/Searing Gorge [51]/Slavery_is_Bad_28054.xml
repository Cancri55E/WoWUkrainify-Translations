  <Title>Slavery is Bad</Title>
  <Description>Much like Overseer Maltorius, I'm a rich dwarf.  However, I earned my riches through hard work and wise decisions, not through slavery.$b$bOK fine, very little slavery.  Hardly any.$b$bAnyhow, the first thing that I see inside these caverns are slavedrivers and taskmasters.  I won't stand for this!  As you progress through the cavern, kill as many as you can.  Report your results to Evonice Sootsmoker, deeper within the Slag Pit.</Description>
