  <Title>Twisted Twilight Ties</Title>
  <Description>Hansel and I came here on a secret mission: kill Overseer Maltorius.  While our main goal still remains the same - defeating Archduke Calcinder - it can't hurt to take out the infamous overseer of the Slag Pit while we're here.$b$bProblem is, Hansel was only prepared to fight one dwarf, but it looks like Maltorius has a visitor... an emissary from the Twilight's Hammer!$b$bSpeak with Hansel and help him out.  Then proceed down this corridor and along the balcony outside to find Overseer Oilfist.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Hansel Heavyhands and help him assault Overseer Maltorius and Twilight-Lord Arkkus.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Twilight's Hammer, eh?  I should've expected as much.  I'm glad you arrived to help them out when you did.$b$bIt looks like, despite all odds, we've pressed our offensive to the doorstep of Calcinder's lair.  It's now time to finish the job.</RewardText>
