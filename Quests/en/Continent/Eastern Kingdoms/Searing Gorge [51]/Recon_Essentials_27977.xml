  <Title>Recon Essentials</Title>
  <Description>We used to have more stuff around here.  I think there was a spyglass somewhere nearby, along with a smithing tuyere.$b$bI'm pretty certain that they've been stolen by Dark Iron dwarves.  Yes, I know that I'm a Dark Iron dwarf!  I'm talking about the bad ones that live down in that gorge.$B$BYou'd best check the steamsmiths that work just south of here.  They'd be most likely to use tools like these.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find and return the Smithing Tuyere and Lookout's Spyglass.</LogDescription>
