  <Title>The Fewer, the Better</Title>
  <Description>I'm not much of a fighter... I'm more of a mining dwarf.  Same goes for Jack and Pris.  And Lunk... well, you'd think he'd be a big fighter, but he's the biggest wimp of all of us.$b$bWhat I'm saying is, it's good that you came here when you did.$b$bIt seems likely that we in the Thorium Brotherhood are going to be fighting the other Dark Iron dwarves soon.  I'm thinking we should pick off some of their finest before the war starts in earnest.  Start with the geologists and watchmen to the south.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 10 Dark Iron Geologists or Dark Iron Watchmen.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The fewer of them that remain, the better our prospects are.</CompletionText>
