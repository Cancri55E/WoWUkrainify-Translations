  <Title>The Mysteries of the Fire-Gizzard</Title>

And why do they taste so bad?$b$bThe key to understanding these prehistoric beasts, I believe, starts with the fire-gizzard.  Every incendosaur has one.  I'd like a few of them to study.$b$bYou'll find incendosaurs circling the foot of Iron Summit, mostly to the west.</Description>
