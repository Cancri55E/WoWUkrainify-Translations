  <Title>A Proper Antivenom</Title>
  <Description>Shame that Lunk left.  I was beginning to enjoy his company.$b$bOh well, back to work!$b$bI'm the closest thing that this expedition has to a medical officer, and I'm running low on antivenom.  We tend to need a lot of antivenom.$b$bThe key to a proper antivenom is ALWAYS to start with the poison itself.  The glassweb spiders nearby should be a good place to start.  If you kill them, you can probably extract some venom from the sacs within their jaws.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 14 samples of Glassweb Venom.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Well well, you certainly operate quickly!  You do have the venom, right?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This... this is way more than I expected.  This will last us for months!</RewardText>
