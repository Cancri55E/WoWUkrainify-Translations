  <Title>Maliciously Delicious</Title>
  <Description>You know, I've got a problem you might be able to help me out with, here.$B$BSee, in addition to the fine pursuit of arms dealing, I'm trying to liven up the entertainment here in Bogpaddle. Apparently there's a bunch of these makrura things in the north waters that don't take kindly to the wild beach parties we've been throwing.$B$BJoke's on them. I'm not gonna be pushed around by giant lobsters; they're my next source of revenue! You bring me some of their tails and we'll turn a problem into profit.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 6 Intact Swampshore Tails from Swampshore Makrura.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You got those tails? Don't be tryin' to push no hacked-up ones on me!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I can see it now: our own famous Bogpaddle Lobster-Poppers! Made fresh from the sea! Oh, it's like this stuff writes itself...$B$BYour help is very much appreciated, my friend. I'll start seeing if I can't cut your people a favorable arrangement, eh?</RewardText>
