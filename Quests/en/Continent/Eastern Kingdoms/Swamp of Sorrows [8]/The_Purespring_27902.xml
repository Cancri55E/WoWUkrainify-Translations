  <Title>The Purespring</Title>
  <Description>Magtoor has told me of the shamanism that the Broken practice. The great Nobundo once said that the path of the elements may, in a way, be another way to the Light.$B$BI can only hope there is some truth in this. The elementals that gather near Purespring Cavern to the south are a source of truly pristine water. They can be chaotic and violent, but the pure water harvested from them will be the perfect conduit for the blessing of the Light.$B$BPlease, bring me this water, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 6 Purespring Motes from Purespring Elementals.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have the elements given up their source?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Such clarity... let us hope this will aid poor Magtoor.</RewardText>
