  <Title>The Dragon and the Temple</Title>
  <Description>These serpents must be from the Temple of Atal'Hakkar. I already had a hint...$B$BNot a few days ago, I had a visitor stop by and ask me to keep an eye out for such things. An elf by the name of Itharius. I'm sure he didn't think I could see through his form... he was a green dragon in disguise, come here to help his fallen brothers no doubt.$B$BHe may very well be on to something. Itharius left for the temple itself. Perhaps you'd better go look for him there. Dark things are afoot.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Lord Itharius atop the outer steps of the Temple of Atal'Hakkar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The goblin sent you? She has a cunning eye, that one.$B$BShe speaks the truth. I am here to stem the tide of corruption seeping from this temple. If you would save your people from a wicked fate, $n, I ask for your assistance.</RewardText>
