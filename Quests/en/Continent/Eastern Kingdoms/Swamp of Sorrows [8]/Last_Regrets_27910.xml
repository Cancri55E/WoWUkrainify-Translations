  <Title>Last Regrets</Title>
  <Description>If I am reduced to groveling, I may as well ask everything I can. There is one last favor I would ask of you, one more task a shamed orc pleads for.$B$BHelgrum had a prized prey. Duskfang, eater of ogres, the great panther of Misty Valley. He would never allow himself the leisure of stalking it. Though he wanted badly to hunt, our scouting duties were too important.$B$BIf he cannot hunt Duskfang in this world, he can hunt the beast in the next. Take up the hunt for him; bring Duskfang's pelt to me.</Description>
