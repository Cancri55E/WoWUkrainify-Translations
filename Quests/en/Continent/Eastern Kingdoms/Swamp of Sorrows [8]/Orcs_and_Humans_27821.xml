  <Title>Orcs and Humans</Title>
  <Description>With war raging across the entire world, the last thing we need is a Horde settlement right in our backyard. Redridge, Duskwood, even Elwynn itself are all a day's march from here.$B$BWe've made the first strike, and I don't plan to give the Horde a chance to catch their breath. So consider yourself deployed. Grab a weapon, join the rest of the troops out in the Bloodmire, and start killing orcs.$B$BReport back here after you've done some damage. I want you back alive...and that's an order. Dismissed!</Description>
