  <Title>Secrets of the Mire</Title>
  <Description>The Shifting Mire takes its name from a unique phenomenon. By some force, the extremely fine silt will collect, and move on its own accord, travelling as if alive.$B$BI originally worried this was some corruptive force, but my studies have shown the opposite; whatever energy invigorates this soil is positive in nature. Perhaps such vibrant life can be imparted onto the Broken to reawaken what they once were.$B$BThe silt may not take kindly to being collected, $n. But please, help gather it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 samples of Invigorated Silt from Shifting Mireglobs.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get those samples?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It will have to be purified, but this will be most helpful. Thank you.</RewardText>
