  <Title>Croc-Out</Title>
  <Description>The Stagalbog east of town is swarming with crocolisks. Swarming, you hear me? I've sold every bit of crocolisk you could imagine.$B$BCrocolisk hides, teeth, tails, tongues, eyes, you name it. My point is, they ain't sellin' anymore. There's too many crocs! We're over-supplied and under-demanded.$B$BSo since they're of no use to me, and they occasionally eat my guests, I need you to just kill the suckers. Do me the favor, eh? I'll be here negotiatin' things with your people.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 8 Sawtooth Crocolisks.</LogDescription>
