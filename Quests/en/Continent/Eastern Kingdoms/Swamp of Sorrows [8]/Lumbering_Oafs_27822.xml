  <Title>Lumbering Oafs</Title>
  <Description>I want victory to be totally assured here. Having more resources isn't enough; we need to make sure the enemy has nothing.$B$BStonard's forces depend on the lumber gathered from the surrounding woods. The orcish peons that chop the lumber may not be warriors, but they still know nothing but hate for humans.$B$BShow no mercy. I want those peons killed and the supply of lumber to Stonard cut off completely.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 5 Stonard Peons.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We've had strikes on our own lumber line while you've been gone. This should at least put us on equal footing for gathering rates.$B$BGood work, $n.</RewardText>
