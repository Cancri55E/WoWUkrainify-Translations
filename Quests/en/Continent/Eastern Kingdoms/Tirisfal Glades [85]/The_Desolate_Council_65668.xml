  <Title>The Desolate Council</Title>
  <Description>By combining our knowledge and expertise, we've restored the surface of the Undercity to the Forsaken.

It was only possible by setting aside our distrust and acting for the good of our people. Now it's time to make this council official.

We are no longer the same undead that followed and served Sylvanas Windrunner. From here on, we lead ourselves, with the same spirit of independence and pride we've had since we reclaimed our free will.

It's time for a new future, with new leadership.</Description>
