  <Title>A Deadly New Ally</Title>
  <Description>Shortly before you arrived at the Bulwark, I was approached by the most unusual young undead woman.  She swore enmity against the Scarlet Crusade, so I sent her to work on our enemies to the north.  You say you saw some dead crusaders earlier?  Those were probably her work.$b$bGo check up on her, and see if she can use any assistance in her vendetta against the Crusade... though I wouldn't be surprised if she's already killed them all.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Look for your new ally at the Scarlet Encampment in Tirisfal Glades.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>As you look over the ruins of the camp, you hear a whisper behind you.$b$b&lt;"I could kill you right now if I wanted to.  You'd better watch your step, $r."&gt;</RewardText>
