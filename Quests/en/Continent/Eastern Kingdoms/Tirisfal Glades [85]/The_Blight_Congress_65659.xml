  <Title>The Blight Congress</Title>
  <Description>We, the Forsaken, have been through a lot since the destruction of Lordaeron. But we're determined to keep our home.

Why should we give up what we've fought so hard to carve out for ourselves?

Calia is still a relative newcomer in some ways, but obviously she's known to our people. How could she not be, as the sister of Arthas himself?

I hope we can move forward, and that she can really help. Her voice could be a powerful one, if she is really truly committed to the people.</Description>
