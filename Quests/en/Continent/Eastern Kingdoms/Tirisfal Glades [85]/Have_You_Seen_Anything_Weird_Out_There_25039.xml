  <Title>Have You Seen Anything Weird Out There?</Title>
  <Description>$R!  Listen up, I got somethin'... odd to discuss.$b$bI was out fishin' by Brightwater Lake when I saw the darnedest thing... some sorta wolf-man, running around Tirisfal.  Ya don't suppose that could be a... worgen, do ya?$b$bAnyway, I keep tellin' myself I should tell Executor Zygand about it, but I just get so scared when I talk to that guy.  Maybe you could talk with him?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Executor Zygand about your encounter with the worgen.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Hmm... yes, that makes sense.  Since the worgen have come streaming out of Gilneas, I knew it would only be a matter of time before they arrived here in Tirisfal.</RewardText>
