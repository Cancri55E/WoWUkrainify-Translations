  <Title>A Daughter's Embrace</Title>
  <Description>The whisper continues:$b$b&lt;"My name is Lilian Voss.  Before I died, I was a member of the Scarlet Crusade.  My father, High Priest Voss, raised me to be a weapon against the plagued.  I studied stealth, sorcery, martial arts, anything to make myself stronger.  I gave up my childhood for him."&gt;$b$b&lt;"Then, as fate would have it, I died and returned as... this.  My father instantly forgot me and, when I returned, ordered me executed."&gt;$b$b&lt;"Come.  We will speak with him now, in his tower to the northwest."&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Lilian Voss to her father in the tower at Crusader's Run.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>From birth to grave to undeath, we all have our own path to follow.  Some are easier than others.  It sounds like this Voss girl has had a rough path so far.$b$bHopefully she ultimately chooses to join us and follow the Dark Lady.  With power like hers, we could do incredible things.$b$bBy the way, $n... excellent work out there.  If you're ever ready and willing, I may have some more work for you in the Plaguelands.</RewardText>
