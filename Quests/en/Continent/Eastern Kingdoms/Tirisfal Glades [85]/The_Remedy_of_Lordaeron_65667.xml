  <Title>The Remedy of Lordaeron</Title>
  <Description>The time has come. By the Light, I pray our plan works.

Master Apothecary Faranell's wagons have reproduced the plague eater many times over, and the bats are ready to deploy them.

If you see a place where our forces could spread even more of the remedy, you can signal them with a flare.

Take to the skies, and let's put an end to this blight. For Lordaeron, and for the Forsaken.</Description>
