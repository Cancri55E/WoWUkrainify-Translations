  <Title>Escaped From Gilneas</Title>
  <Description>As far as you know, a worgen rogue roaming in Tirisfal is a new development.  This is something that Executor Zygand would certainly be interested in.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Report the worgen's presence to Executor Zygand at Brill in Tirisfal Glades.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Hmm... yes, that makes sense.  Since the worgen have come streaming out of Gilneas, I knew it would only be a matter of time before they arrived here in Tirisfal.</RewardText>
