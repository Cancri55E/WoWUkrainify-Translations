  <Title>The Grasp Weakens</Title>
  <Description>While the Frozen Throne lies dormant, the grasp that the Lich King once held over the Scourge grows ever-weaker.  His grip on a weakling like Devlin Agamand should be weak enough that we can remove it entirely.$B$BSpeak with Shadow Priestess Malia in the manor on the east side of town.  She will assist you in the procedure.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Shadow Priestess Malia in Brill and participate in the extraction of Devlin Agamand.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What did you find out?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah, how unfortunate.  Perhaps the Scourge's dominion over Devlin's mind remained too strong.  Or perhaps our methods are simply not strong enough.  It's also possible that Devlin was too simple-minded to comprehend what we were asking him.</RewardText>
