  <Title>Graverobbers</Title>
  <Description>The mass graves within the forest to the west of us were made to accommodate the... impressive... number of deaths Tirisfal suffered when the plague first came.  $B$BThe bodies in these graves have so far been spared an undeath, but the Scourge now send Rot Hide gnolls to gather the corpses and use them to bolster their armies.  This cannot be allowed!$B$BYour task is twofold: slay the Rot Hides at the mass grave and Garren's Haunt, and gather from them the embalming ichor that gives them life.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Rot Hide Graverobbers and Rot Hide Mongrels, and obtain 6 flasks of Embalming Ichor.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is your task complete?  Have you destroyed those dog-things and drained them of their ichor?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Expertly done, $n.  The Scourge are mistaken if they think they can use those corpses against us, and the fluid you gathered from the Rot Hide slaves will be studied by my master.  It may have secrets we can use against them.</RewardText>
