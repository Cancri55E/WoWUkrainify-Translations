  <Title>Assemble the Forsaken</Title>
  <Description>It's heartening to see progress has been made in rebuilding Brill, but this is only a first step. The ruins of the capital remain inaccessible because of the blight.

And here is where I hope you will aid the cause.

Restoring as much of the land as possible will require a gathering of minds all working toward a singular purpose.

A number of influential figures have risen to prominence among the Forsaken. Please help bring them together so we can meet and discuss the path forward.</Description>
