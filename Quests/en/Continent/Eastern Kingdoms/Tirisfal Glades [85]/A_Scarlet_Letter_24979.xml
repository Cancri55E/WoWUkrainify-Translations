  <Title>A Scarlet Letter</Title>
  <Description>Lieutenant Gebler:$b$bHow curious that you would decide to take a prisoner... an undead one at that.  What were you thinking?  Do you think that, just because of the prisoner's former status, that she would be above the edicts of the Scarlet Crusade?$b$bThis is most troubling, Gebler.  I would remind you that there are penalties for such behavior.  I command you to execute the prisoner at once.  She is no longer one of us.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find the prisoner in Scarlet Palisade.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>A letter?  What does it say?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The Scarlet Crusade takes no prisoners.  That they would do so with this young woman... curious.$b$bThe powers that you describe are even more curious.  She passed through the bars of her prison and killed her captor?  Why hadn't she done that in the first place?</RewardText>
