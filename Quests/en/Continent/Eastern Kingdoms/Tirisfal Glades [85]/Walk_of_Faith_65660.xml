  <Description>I promised that I would help, and I shall. We need that pure sample of the plague afflicting Lordaeron, but we cannot put anyone else at risk.

Come with me. I will call forth a shield of Holy Light to safeguard us deep into the blighted area so that we can collect that sample.

This spell will require my full focus. I'll trust you to protect us from anything that might try to stop us.

Are you with me?</Description>
