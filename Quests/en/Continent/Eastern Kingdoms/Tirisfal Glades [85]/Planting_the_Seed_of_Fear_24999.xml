  <Title>Planting the Seed of Fear</Title>
  <Description>It seems that Jerrod has you hunting the murlocs to the north.  That's good... we can use their parts for our poisons.  I get a little worried sometimes, though...$b$bThe Vile Fin spawning grounds are not far off Tirisfal's northern coast, so you'll probably notice several tadpoles among the adults on the shore.  If these impressionable young murlocs were to seek revenge against us... that could ruin us.  Go chase them, and show them that the Forsaken and the Horde are not to be trifled with.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Chase 12 Vile Fin Tadpoles until they pass out in fear.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Chase them until they pass out in fear, $n.  Let them grow up in fear of the Forsaken.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Did they run from you, $n?  Good.  This is better than killing them... if they live to tell the tale, then future generations of murlocs will learn to fear us.</RewardText>
