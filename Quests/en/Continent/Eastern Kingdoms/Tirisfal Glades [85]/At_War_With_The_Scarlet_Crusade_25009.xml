  <Title>At War With The Scarlet Crusade</Title>

It should prove to be a devastating blow to the Crusade!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 3 Scarlet Zealots and 4 Scarlet Friars.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I see you have returned but your task is not complete.  Perhaps you are at ease with the mere humans interfering with The Dark Lady's plan?  Or perhaps you can heed the call of duty and slay the Scarlet band that lies only moments away!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Your actions will slow down the Scarlet Crusade's advancement in Tirisfal quite a bit... hopefully for good.  But other threats loom.</RewardText>
