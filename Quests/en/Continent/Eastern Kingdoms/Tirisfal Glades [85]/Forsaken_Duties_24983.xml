  <Description>I need a fresh report from our Deathguard waystation to the east.$B$BI must know if more Scourge forces have slipped past The Bulwark and into Tirisfal.  Our vigilance on the border to the Plaguelands must be maintained - we can't let the Scourge get a stronger foothold here!$B$BTravel south along the road, then east at the fork to the waystation.  Speak with Deathguard Linnea.  She has the information I need.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Deathguard Linnea at Death's Watch Waystation in Tirisfal Glades.</LogDescription>
