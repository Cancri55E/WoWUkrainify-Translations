  <Title>Deaths in the Family</Title>
  <Description>The Agamand family was the most prosperous family in Tirisfal Glades.  I used to work their mills...before the plague.$B$BWhen the Scourge first came, the Agamands fortified their home and convinced those in their employ to remain and help them defend.  We were fools, but at least we were loyal fools.$B$BThe Agamands, in their pride, doomed us to undeath.  And now they are minions of the Scourge!$B$BServe the Forsaken by defeating the Agamands who fell to the plague.  Serve me by bringing me their remains.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain Gregor's Remains, Nissa's Remains, Thurman's Remains, and Devlin's Remains.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the remains of the Agamands?  Are those cursed beasts finally destroyed?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Revenge has a sweet taste, don't you think?  When you destroyed the Agamands, did you catch any hint of free will within them?  I hope so.  I hope they knew fear before they were smashed into oblivion.$B$BIt is a foolish hope, I know.  But it is a hope I foster nonetheless.</RewardText>
