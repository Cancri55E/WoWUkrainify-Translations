  <Title>The Good Stuff</Title>
  <Description>I've got a little proposition for you, if you're interested.$b$bThose Dark Irons were here before Durdin and his crew arrived.  That means that, once these titan ruins opened up, the dark irons were the first ones in there, lootin' all the good stuff.  I'll bet they've still got those treasures locked up inside Angor Fortress, northwest of here.$b$bYou've more than proven your ability to wallop a dwarf.  Head on into that fortress and wallop your way to titan treasure.$b$bI'd go with, but I'm drunk.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search for treasure in the bottom floor of Angor Fortress.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Back so soon?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Now here's some treasure!  I was beginning to worry that these weren't titan ruins at all!$b$bI'll show these to Durdin.  Thanks again, $n.</RewardText>
