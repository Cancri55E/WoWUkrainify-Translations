  <Title>Lifting the Veil</Title>
  <Description>The black dragonflight was once noble.  They were the earth warders, protecting the very land itself.  How ironic that they would become the worst menace the land has known.$b$bI believe that there remains a sliver of hope, however, and so does my mistress.  The black dragonflight will live beyond Deathwing's treachery, and will soar as the noble earth warders once again.$b$bI wish to show you something.  Close your eyes, and I will reveal to you the final part of my studies.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Witness the final piece of Rhea's studies.</LogDescription>
