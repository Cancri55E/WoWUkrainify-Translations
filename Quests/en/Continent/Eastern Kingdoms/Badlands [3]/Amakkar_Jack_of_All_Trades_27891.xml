  <Description>Before we get too crazy with the dragon-killing, let me tell you a little bit about how I fight.$b$bI'm not terribly strong or stalwart like these other two, but I've got a few tricks.  At your command I'll stun your enemies to keep 'em held still.  I also make sure to keep a few potions around for tight spots.$b$bWhy don't we practice fighting together?  Head out into the field, and you can see what it's like to fight with a real orc.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Amakkar's Kidney Shot and Amakkar's Pocket Potion.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We're not through yet, $n.</CompletionText>
