  <Title>The Morons' League</Title>
  <Description>I need your help in a little project I'm working on, $n.  It falls into a realm I like to call "defensive archaeology".$b$bI like to bury non-magical items in conspicuous places to fool those Alliance idiots into thinking they've found something valuable.$b$bHmm... Dark Iron dwarves wander Hammertoe's Digsite and Angor Fortress, to the north.  Bring their heads back to me.  Yes, that's right, their heads.$b$bOnce the flesh is stripped, we can use those skulls to interfere with the dwarves' work.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 15 Dark Iron Heads.</LogDescription>
