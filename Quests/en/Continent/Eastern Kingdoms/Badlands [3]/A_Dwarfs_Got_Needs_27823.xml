  <Title>A Dwarf's Got Needs</Title>
  <Description>I can appreciate a good diggin' as much as any other dwarf, don't get me wrong.  It's just that... well, we do so much diggin', and so little drinkin', that sometimes I wonder if I should just hang up me shovel and head back to Ironforge.$b$bBut not today.  I've got some diggin' in me yet.$b$bThose Dark Iron dwarves at Hammertoe's Digsite - just north of here - make some powerful fine beer, right here in the desert.  You think you could pick up a few for me?</Description>
