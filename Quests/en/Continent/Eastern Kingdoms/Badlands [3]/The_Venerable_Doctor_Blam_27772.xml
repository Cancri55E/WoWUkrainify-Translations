  <Title>The Venerable Doctor Blam</Title>
  <Description>I made a calculated decision in revealing my identity to you, $n.  I needed you to trust me, but I can no longer stay here in Lethlor Ravine, as my cover has quite clearly been blown.$b$bYou may be able to slip away unnoticed, however.  Here, take the results of our research, and bring them west.  At Agmond's End, you will find a gnome who knows what to do with these samples.$b$bHurry, $n!  You mustn't loiter here any longer than necessary!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Black Dragon Samples to Dr. Hieronymus Blam at Agmond's End in the Badlands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Dr. H. Blam, at your service.  How can I be of assistance to you today?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ooh!  Science stuff!  Let's see what you've got here...$b$bWild eggs?  Blech.  Useless.  These are never any good.$b$bOoooh, what's this?  Some sort of... pre-engineered egg?  This looks promising, but I don't want to know what Rhea had to do to get it.$b$bHmm... yes, some very nice corpses.  Very nice indeed.$b$bAlright, I'll see what I can do.</RewardText>
