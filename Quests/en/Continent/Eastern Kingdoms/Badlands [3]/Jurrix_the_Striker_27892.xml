  <Title>Jurrix the Striker</Title>
  <Description>Oh, you want to talk?  Fine.$b$bI'm Jurrix, the only merc here with half a brain.  The only one with any bite to my attacks, too.  The only reason I keep these meat shields around is to keep myself from getting killed.$b$bListen, you're the boss of this operation.  You give the word, and I'll send a fireball right through your target's heart.  If things start getting hectic, I can even warp time a bit so you can fit in a few extra attacks.$b$bWhy don't we go try fighting together?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Jurrix's Fiery Blast and Jurrix's Time Warp.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We're not quite ready yet.  A little more practice, then we'll get with the dragon-slaying.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I think you're ready, $n.  You're getting the hang of this.</RewardText>
