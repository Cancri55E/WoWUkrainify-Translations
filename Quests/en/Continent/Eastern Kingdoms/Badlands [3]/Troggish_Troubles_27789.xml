  <Title>Troggish Troubles</Title>
  <Description>I'll need some time to analyze these samples, as well as a break from this trogg-shooting duty.  Go man one of my turrets and take out as many troggs as you can.  I'll be here studying.$b$bThe turrets have two abilities: a regular shot, as well as an electrical overload, for when too many enemies get close!  Heh, heh.  Good luck.$b$bOh, and look out for the big, slow troggs.  You probably don't want to let them anywhere near you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Enter a Blam Turret, then survive four waves of trogg attacks.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Not quite done yet.  Need some more time.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The results are in.  I've identified traces of corruption in all three samples you brought me.  Rhea will be quite disappointed.</RewardText>
