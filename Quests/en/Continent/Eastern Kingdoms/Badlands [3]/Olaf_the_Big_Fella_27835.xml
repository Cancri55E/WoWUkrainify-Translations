  <Title>Olaf, the Big Fella'</Title>
  <Description>You may not have noticed, but I'm pretty big, as far as dwarves go.$b$bI make sure that my two brothers here don't get into too much trouble.  They're small, and they don't have a big shield like me.  I'm big, and I can handle a few monsters hitting me!  Plus, if I'm careful, I can usually get them to hit my shield instead!$b$bI can protect you, too.  Come on, let's go practice for a bit.  I'll make sure the enemies attack me, and not you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Olaf's Shield Wall and Olaf's Mighty Shout.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>See?  No need to worry when Olaf is around.  Just let me know, and I'll protect you from the monsters.</RewardText>
