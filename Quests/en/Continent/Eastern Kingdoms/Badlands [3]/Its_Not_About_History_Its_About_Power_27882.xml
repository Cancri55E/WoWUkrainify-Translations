  <Title>It's Not About History, It's About Power</Title>
  <Description>The Explorers' League may have a yeoman's knowledge of the actual act of digging.  What they lack, however, is the good sense to USE the artifacts that they dig up.  They stow their treasures in stagnant museums instead of using these items of power for their true purpose.$b$bThe dwarves are fools.  Fortunately, they die easily.$b$bYou'll find them digging into canyon walls north of here.  Take whatever you can out of their stubby-fingered hands, then return it to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain a Broken Chalice, a Dusty Vase, an Earthen Hieroglyph, and a Trogg Tool.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You've returned with liberated artifacts, I presume?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Chalice... worthless.$b$bVase... counterfeit.$b$bHieroglyph... interesting, but rather common.$b$bWhat's this?  I've never seen trogg craftsmanship of this caliber!  You've stumbled upon something rare indeed, $n.$b$bWe must not be so hasty as to overlook the troggs.  They may be simple, but they know things about the deep, hidden places of this world.$b$bYou've performed well enough.  Let's talk titans, shall we?</RewardText>
