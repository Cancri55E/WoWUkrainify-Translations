  <Title>Eric, the Utility Dwarf</Title>
  <Description>Before we get too crazy what with the dragon-killin', let me tell you a little bit about how I fight.$b$b"The Swift" is what they call me, and here's why: I'll dash straight into your enemies - helmet first, mind you - and stun 'em for a few seconds.  I also keep a few potions with me for tight spots.$b$bWhy don't we practice fightin' together?  Head out into the field, and try out my abilities.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Eric's Charge and Eric's Pocket Potion.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'm not what you'd call "very strong" or "battle-hardened", but I get the job done my own way.$b$bLookin' forward to fightin' with you.  I never fought with a fancy-lookin' $c before.</RewardText>
