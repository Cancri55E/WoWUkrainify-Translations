  <Title>Gargal, the Behemoth</Title>
  <Description>You may not have noticed, but I'm pretty big, as far as orcs go.$b$bI make sure that my two pals here don't get into too much trouble.  They're small, and they don't have a big shield like me.  I'm big, and I can handle a few monsters hitting me!  Plus, if I'm careful, I can usually get them to hit my shield instead!$b$bI can protect you, too.  Come on, let's go practice for a bit.  I'll make sure the enemies attack me, and not you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Gargal's Shield Wall and Gargal's Mighty Shout.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Don't worry, little $r.  I'll protect you.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>See?  No need to worry when Gargal is around.  Just let me know, and I'll protect you from the monsters.</RewardText>
