  <Title>Baelog, the Glass Cannon</Title>
  <Description>Before I start droppin' arrows on those dragons, I'd better introduce myself.$b$bI'm Baelog, the muscle of this group.  My sword bites like a crocolisk, and my arrows sing like banshees.  I tend to wear down quickly, however, and can't take as much punishment as either of my two brothers.$b$bYou give the word, and I'll send an aimed shot right through your target's heart.  I can also cheer my brothers on, sending 'em into a battle-fueled frenzy.$b$bWhy don't we go try fighting together?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Baelog's Valhalla Shot and Baelog's Warcry.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I think you're ready, $n.  You're getting the hang of this.</RewardText>
