  <Title>To Fuselight Proper</Title>
  <Description>This, $r, is paradise.  I've always wanted to live in a nice quiet town by the sea so I can focus on my explosions without any distractions.$b$bQuiet's not for everybody, though... 'specially the adventuring hero-type, like yourself.$b$bWe've installed a teleporter in the backside of town that'll take you up to the top of the cliffs.  From there, you can take the quick ride west into Fuselight proper, within the Badlands.$b$bThere should be more for you to do up there.  Tell 'em that Flo sent you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Teleporter in the back of Fuselight-by-the-Sea to port up the mountain, then report to Dolph Blastus at Fuselight in the Badlands.</LogDescription>
