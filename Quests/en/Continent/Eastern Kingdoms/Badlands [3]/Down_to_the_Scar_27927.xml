  <Title>Down to the Scar</Title>
  <Description>The Badlands are home to some unusual people, many of whom have been here for quite a long time.$b$bFor example, there were three gentlemen who were staying here in town.  I forget their names... the dwarf was Theldurin, I think?  Anyhow, they headed south with a pack full of ale a couple of days ago, and haven't been heard from since.  I think they were headed to that big scar.$b$bWould you mind checking in on them?  I'd like to make sure that they're alright.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Theldurin the Lost at the Scar of the Worldbreaker in the Badlands.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>They sent you to check up on us?  Pshh... I've been around this desert longer than any of those chumps.  We're just soaking in some of the scenery and telling stories about old times.$b$bYou like telling stories?</RewardText>
