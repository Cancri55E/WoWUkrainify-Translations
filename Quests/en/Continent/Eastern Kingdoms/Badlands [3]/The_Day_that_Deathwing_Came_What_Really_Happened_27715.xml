  <Title>The Day that Deathwing Came: What Really Happened</Title>
  <Description>These two have no idea how to tell a story.  Theldurin's story was too short, and Lucien's tale was a little too tall, if you catch my drift.$b$bAlso, neither of their stories had action and fans admiring my awesomeness in them.$b$bSit back, $n.  I'll tell you what really happened that day.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Listen to Martek the Exiled's version of the story.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I can't believe those guys would interrupt me like that.  My story was going so well, too...$b$bAnyhow, thanks for sticking around so long.  It's nice to have someone new to share tall tales with.  I'm sure Lucien and Theldurin feel the same way.$b$bYou have any you'd like to share with us?</RewardText>
