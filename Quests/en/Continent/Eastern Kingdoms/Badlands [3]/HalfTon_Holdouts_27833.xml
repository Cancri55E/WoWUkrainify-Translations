  <Description>I'd say we have a dragon problem, but it seems like they're a little more interested in New Kargath than they are in our small encampment.  Nevertheless, I've got top men focused on keeping the dragons at bay.$b$bOne problem that has gone unchecked, however, is the ogre camp to our southwest.  A small army of combatants seems to have appeared outside of their hovel.$b$bWe can't sit and wait for them to flank us, soldier.  Thin their ranks before they thin ours.</Description>
