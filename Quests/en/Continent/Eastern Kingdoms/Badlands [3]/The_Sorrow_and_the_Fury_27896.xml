  <Title>The Sorrow and the Fury</Title>
  <Description>My greatest regret is the treatment that we - no, I - gave to Nyxondra.  I forced her to lay eggs, then I performed experiments on them.  Over, and over, and over again.$b$bEven as a mother myself, I can only imagine her sorrow.$b$bNo... I mustn't be weak.  Our work is, after all, for the benefit of future generations of black dragons.  Her sacrifice was necessary.$b$bShe circles the Ruins of Kargath, northwest of New Kargath, insane with fury.  Please, heroes... put her out of her misery.</Description>
