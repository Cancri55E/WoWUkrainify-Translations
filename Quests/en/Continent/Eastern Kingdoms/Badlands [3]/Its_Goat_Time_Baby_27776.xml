  <Title>It's Goat Time, Baby</Title>
  <Description>We have a little bit of a goat problem here in Fuselight, in case you haven't noticed.  They'll eat anything, and they seem to have taken a liking to the piles of cogs and gears that we tend to leave sitting around.$b$bIt's getting really annoying!$b$bYou'll find most of the billy goats wandering around the edge of town, near the cliff's edge.  Use this device on them to give 'em a little "nudge".</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Garyanne's Goat Puncher on 12 Billy Goats in Fuselight.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It's their own fault for standing so close to the edge</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done!  I have no doubt that those goats will be back, but they'll think twice before they nibble my cogs again!</RewardText>
