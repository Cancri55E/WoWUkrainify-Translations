  <Title>This Ain't My War</Title>
  <Description>They asked me to fight in those wars. I didn't ask them! I did what I had to do to win. So I end up getting captured by those filthy, crap-swilling, maggot orcs and for five long years they used me as a toilet. Finally I break out and head back to my hometown and what do I get? People spitting on me, protesting me, calling me a baby orc killer and all kinds of vile crap!$B$BNo, I don't think I'll be helping you. You go back to Troteman and you tell him that this ain't my war.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Colonel Troteman.</LogDescription>
