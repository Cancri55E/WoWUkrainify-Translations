  <Title>Still Assessing the Threat</Title>
  <Description>Damned worthless gnolls are up to no good. I can feel it in my bones. Gnoll activity in the area has tripled in the past two weeks. I fear they might be mounting up to make an assault on Lakeshire.$B$BI need you to head to each of the gnoll camps of this area and gather any information that you come across. Check the camps directly north of here, east of here and southeast of here. Bring back whatever you find.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Steal the Gnoll Battle Plans, Gnoll Orders and Gnoll Strategy Guide.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find the gnoll plans?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I knew it! Looks like Yowler is behind this uprising - which is incredible, because we keep killing gnolls named Yowler. I don't know how many sons the original Yowler had, but it's got to be close to a hundred.$B$BWell, looks like we got ourselves another Yowler to kill.$B$BMagistrate Solomon must be notified.</RewardText>
