  <Title>An Unwelcome Guest</Title>
  <Description>Once again my garden was trampled and pillaged.  And I know the brute who is doing it.  It's that forsaken boar, the one Marshal Marris has taken to calling Bellygrub.$b$bI won't be able to re-plant the daffodils until next season now.  Ruined!  All ruined by that one menacing boar.  Put an end to that pest!  Show me his tusk and I'd be happy to reward you.  He seems to spend his time foraging in the field southwest of Lakeshire but occasionally he roams over here and into my garden.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Bellygrub and take Bellygrub's Tusk.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is Bellygrub still at it or were you able to rid Lakeshire of the pest once and for all?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Finally the menace is laid to rest!  Thank you, $n, you have done me a great service.  The garden shall be in full bloom this season!</RewardText>
