  <Title>Point of Contact: Brubaker</Title>
  <Description>Before we do a damned thing we need to get a field kit together. You'll help with that, $n. There's also a matter of scouting. Thankfully for that we got some help from Stormwind. An old war buddy of mine, Brubaker, was sent here by SI:7 to scout around for us. You're to meet him in the field, just south of here.$B$BMeet up with Brubaker and find out what he knows.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Brubaker.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Brubaker is dead. It looks like the orcs are attempting to send a message with this grisly display. Upon closer examination you notice something in Brubaker's pouch.</RewardText>
