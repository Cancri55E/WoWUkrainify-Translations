  <Title>Reclaimers' Business in Desolace</Title>
  <Description>There's work to be done in Desolace, $n. It's an atrocious place, befouled by centaur and other nasties. But if you're looking for a good week's honest work, then head there, meet with Kreldig Ungor, and tell him I sentcha.$B$BYou can find him holed up at Nijel's Point--it's a little cozy camp hidden in the mountains of northern Desolace. Just head east if you enter from the Stonetalon Mountains. It's easy to miss, so be on the lookout.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Kreldig Ungor in Desolace.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Glad to see the Reclaimers aren't in short supply of work, or adventurers willing to help out.$B$BI'm Kreldig, $n. You've made a smart move helpin' out the Reclaimers. Everyone needs something these days: they've lost a family heirloom, a magic item, a loved one. You never can tell. But with the Reclaimers around, there's no reason, for the right price, everyone can't find what they've lost. </RewardText>
