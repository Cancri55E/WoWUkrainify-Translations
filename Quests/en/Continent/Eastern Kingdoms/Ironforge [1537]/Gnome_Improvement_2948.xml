  <Description>Listen $n, that ring is yours, sure... but I can make you a better one!  That design, like I said, is really simple.  I am a lot more skilled now, and for the mere fee of thirty silver coins I'll spruce it up for you!  Well, a little more than thirty, actually...$B$BI'm in a tight spot right now; all my material stock is all dried up.  If you bring me a bar of silver and a moss agate, I'll add a silver and agate lattice to the ring that will give it a little more pizzazz!$B$BTrust me!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Brilliant Gold Ring, a Silver Bar, a Moss Agate, and 30 silver coins to Talvash del Kissel in Ironforge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the materials I need?  I wouldn't ask you for them if I wasn't down on my luck...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah, exactly what I needed!  Someday, when I find myself out of this hole that I am unjustly in, I will make for you, for EVERYONE the finest trinkets in all of Azeroth!  Until then, thanks for being a sport about the reagents.  I'd normally charge ten times what I have charged you for a ring of this quality...$B$BSpeaking of rings, here's your new one!</RewardText>
