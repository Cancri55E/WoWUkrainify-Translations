  <Title>The Perfect Fuel</Title>
  <Description>How much do you know about fuel, $n?  Constructing the perfect fuel is a tricky job, as there's plenty of factors to balance: chrono-pyroxidation parameters, tempero-incendiary variables, conflagrational siltification criteria... and that's only naming a few.$b$bHopefully the samples you brought me can be combined in the right proportions to create... the perfect bio-fuel.  Use that table over there and try combining some samples!  Bring the result to me when you're done.</Description>
