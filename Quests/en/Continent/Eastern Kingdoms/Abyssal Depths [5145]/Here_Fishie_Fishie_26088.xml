  <Description>&lt;Orako rolls the glow-juice into a ball, then attaches it to a device that he's clearly been working on for a long time.&gt;$b$bHere, I got you this hat.  It has a light on it, and it will make fish follow you.  Just like the murlocs!$b$bThe murlocs like to hunt in the kelp and coral along the sides of the canyon.  If you put on this hat and swim in that kelp, you might catch some fish like they do.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Put on the Fish Hat, then swim through the coral in Underlight Canyon to attract 30 Underlight Nibblers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How many did you catch?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hmm... you got a lot of fish, but none of these are the ones that ate my wolf.  I think it was probably a bigger fish.</RewardText>
