  <Title>Coldlights Out</Title>
  <Description>Oh yeah!  I was supposed to put together a report!  I'd almost forgotten!$b$bLooks like mostly harmless wildlife around here... 'cept for those blasted eels... and a few murlocs.  Cap'n will be more interested in the murlocs, I think.$b$bGo engage a few of 'em in combat and see what kinda moves they got.  From what I've seen, the big ones hunt for fish in the kelp, and the little ones practice some kind o' magic or another... but that's all I know.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 4 Coldlight Hunters and 4 Coldlight Oracles.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Ya gotta get back out there, $n.  Cap'n needs this recon, and he's counting on me!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Humphrey listens as you recount your fights with the Coldlight murlocs.&gt;$b$bHmm... they sound like regular ol' murlocs... just underwater.  That'll make Cap'n Glovaal happy.</RewardText>
