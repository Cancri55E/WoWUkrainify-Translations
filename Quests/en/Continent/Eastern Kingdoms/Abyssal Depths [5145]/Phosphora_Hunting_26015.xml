  <Title>Phosphora Hunting</Title>
  <Description>Oskar's last wish, before he floated up into that great-eel's gullet, was to bring back food for the captain, so that's what we'll do.$b$bMy brother had a genius plan.  He saw those murlocs luring fish out of the reeds with a phosphorescent antenna, and devised a way to make one of his own.  All ya need is something that glows.$b$bKill the crabs and groupers that roam the canyon's floor.  They aren't edible themselves, but their phosphora is far more valuable than their meat.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 6 Underlight Phosphora from Pyreshell Scuttlers and Luxscale Groupers in Underlight Canyon.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We need enough phosphora to make a really bright light, especially if you're going to be competing with those murlocs.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Humphrey grabs the phosphora from you and attaches it to an unusual device.&gt;$b$bThere ya go.  It's beautiful!  Oskar would be proud.</RewardText>
