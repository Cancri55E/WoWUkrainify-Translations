  <Title>Environmental Awareness</Title>
  <Description>Have you ever smelled submarine fuel, $n?  It's nasty stuff.  Unfortunately, we need to burn huge amounts of it to get the Verne to move, and it's both bad-smelling AND deadly to the local wildlife.  We need to be more environmentally conscious.$b$bThe sea creatures nearby have particularly oily flesh.  Take this device up to Seabrush - just above this cave - and use it on the corpses of terrapins, remoras, and hammerhead sharks.  Their oil might save the lives of hundreds of other sea creatures.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Oil Extrusion Pump on the corpses of Seabrush Terrapins, Scourgut Remoras, and Spinescale Hammerheads in Seabrush to obtain 4 Terrapin Oil, 4 Remora Oil, and 4 Hammerhead Oil.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Please... don't tell the other goblins that I'm an environmentalist!  I don't think I can take the mocking!</CompletionText>
