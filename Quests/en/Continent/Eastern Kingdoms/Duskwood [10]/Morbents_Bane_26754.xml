This should let you defeat Morbent Fel's dark magic.&gt;$B$B&lt;Further down the tunnel, away from the direction you came from, a heinous cackle rings out. It's the clattering laugh of a lich. Morbent Fel is just ahead!&gt;</Description>

  <RewardText>May the disgusting monster stay dead this time!$B$BI'll head down there and scatter his remains to ash myself, $n. You've done a great thing; perhaps in time Duskwood can return to its former peaceful state.</RewardText>
