  <Title>Dusky Crab Cakes</Title>
  <Description>I'll let you in on a little secret - Dusky "Crab" Cakes are really made from spider meat!  I know it's a bit disgusting, but the cakes have a nice, tangy flavor and make great snacks!$B$BIf you want to try some still, I'm afraid I'm out of meat. I need some lump meat to whip up a few more cakes.$B$BVenom Web Spiders are a good source - they nest to the north, between the foothills and the river.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 6 Dusky Lumps from Venom Web Spiders.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hail, $n.  Did you get that lump meat for me?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah yes, a nice lump you have there!  Let me just get this seasoned with my secret spices (no looking!) and get them to skittering on a skillet for a while...$B$BAnd, although Dusky Crab Cakes are my specialty and I won't give out the recipe, here's the recipe for a dish that's almost as good.</RewardText>
