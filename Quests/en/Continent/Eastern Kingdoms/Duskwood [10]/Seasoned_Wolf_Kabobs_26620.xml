  <Title>Seasoned Wolf Kabobs</Title>
  <Description>Seasoned wolf kabobs are a house favorite!  Sure, I can make you some.  But first I'll need the supplies.$B$BBring me five wolf skirt steaks.  The dire wolves near the river north of town are good to hunt; I wouldn't stray too far into the woods if I were you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 5 Wolf Skirt Steaks from Dire Wolves.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to find five wolf skirt steaks yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Mmm-mmm! The skirtsteak's the best part. It's not an efficient way to cook, though.$B$BHere, have this recipe. It's a little different, but flank meat's easier to come by when you really need a meal.</RewardText>
