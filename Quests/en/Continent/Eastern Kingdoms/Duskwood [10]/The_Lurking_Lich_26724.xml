And now he continues to ruin this land.$B$BI remember Duskwood before all this, $n. I remember bright skies and peaceful woods. This can't stand! Morbent Fel must be stopped for good.$B$BSpeak to Sister Elsington. Her vision might guide you to where Morbent Fel is, and how he can be defeated.</Description>
