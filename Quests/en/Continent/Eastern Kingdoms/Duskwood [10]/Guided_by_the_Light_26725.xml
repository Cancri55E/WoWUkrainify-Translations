  <Title>Guided by the Light</Title>
  <Description>Sven is correct. I can feel the presence of a powerful evil deep beneath the Raven Hill Cemetery. Evil lurks in its catacombs, and Morbent Fel must be the source.$B$BYou will need the power of the Light to strike him down, $n. Sven told me the heroes who first slew Morbent Fel wielded an artifact of lightforged iron, imbued with holy power. That artifact is still here!$B$BI can feel it as well, a glimmer of light amidst the darkness. Search Raven Hill for it, and let the Light guide you through it.</Description>
