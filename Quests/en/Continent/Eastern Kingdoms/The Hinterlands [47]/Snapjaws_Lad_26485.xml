  <Title>Snapjaws, Lad!</Title>
  <Description>I've got plans to brew up somethin' special for those pesky trolls. Aye, I said for them... a brew they won't ever forget! A brew that'll have them pickin' their tusks out of the hillsides!$B$BI've got a few ingredients steepin' already, but I could use a hand gatherin' more. At the bottom of the Overlook Cliffs to the east, near the shore, is a whole mess o' snapjaws. I need fresh, whole gizzards from them for my blastbrew.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 Snapjaw Gizzards from Saltwater Snapjaws.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Got those gizzards?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah, nice an' fresh. I'll get those going while you fetch me some more goods then...</RewardText>
