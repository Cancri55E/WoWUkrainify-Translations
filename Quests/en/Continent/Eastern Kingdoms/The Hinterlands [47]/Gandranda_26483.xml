It'd be nice to get this battle over with, aye?$B$BTheir commander, Gan'dranda, sits in the ruined walls to the southeast of the battlefield. Our boys have most of their forces locked up, so I want you to slip in there and take out Gan'dranda. When they see a $r standin' over the corpse of their biggest hero it should take some of the fight out of 'em!</Description>
