  <Title>The Eye of Shadra</Title>
  <Description>Gryphon Master Talonaxe has sent me here to deal with Shadra, the Venom Queen. The conquest of Jintha'Alor isn't enough... the trolls could regroup and summon this creature later, when we're not expecting it.$B$BWe'll gather the artifacts first, pull Shadra into this world on our own terms, and put our hammers to that foul creature. I'll need you to help find the artifacts, and put a hurt on the rest of the trolls while you're at it.$B$BWe first need the Eye of Shadra, guarded in Agol'watha to the north.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover the Eye of Shadra from Agol'watha.</LogDescription>
