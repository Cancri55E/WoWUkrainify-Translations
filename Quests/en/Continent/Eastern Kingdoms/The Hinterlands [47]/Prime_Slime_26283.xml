  <Title>Prime Slime</Title>
  <Description>I've become very interested in the slimes inhabiting Skulk Rock. No matter how many times they're cleared out, they seem to return, yet it doesn't seem they're capable of reproducing from a single slime.$B$BI think something's growing in there. There's a source where all the slimes come from, and I want to study it. Find this source, and bring me back a sample.</Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>The Direglob</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>Try not to get too close... Who knows what this thing is capable of?</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Collect a Direglob Sample from The Direglob.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Well? What did you find?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Fascinating... How large did you say it was? I wonder if others could be found intact...$B$BThis sample is excellent. I'll be sharing it with my fellow researchers.</RewardText>
