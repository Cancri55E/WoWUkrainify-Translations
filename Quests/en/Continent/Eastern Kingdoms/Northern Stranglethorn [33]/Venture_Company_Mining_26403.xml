  <Title>Venture Company Mining</Title>
  <Description>Man, I hate the Venture Company.  They have a string of operations through Stranglethorn which keeps hard-working goblins, like me, from making honest gold!$B$BMy way? Theft. The Venture Co. geologists near Lake Nazferiti to the northwest are deeply interested in those strange blue crystals they have been finding in the mines.  Bring me samples of the stone from their geologists.  I don't care what you have to do to get them. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 5 Tumbled Crystals to Skeezy Whillzap at Bambala in Northern Stranglethorn.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have those crystals??  I need them!!$B$BI mean...I need to know the evil Venture Company is losing ground in Stranglethorn.  Because, you know, we honest folk have to make a living!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Great!  Wonderful!  I can get a bundle for these!!$B$BThat Venture Company sure picked the wrong jungle to mine in, didn't they?  We'd all be in better shape if they moved out of here.</RewardText>
