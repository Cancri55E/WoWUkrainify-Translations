  <Title>Deep Roots</Title>
  <Description>On a somewhat unrelated note, I've been putting together a collection of troll stories and legends for a... personal project.  I was just thinking you might be able to help me find some of them.$b$bThe Bloodscalps at the Bal'lal ruins, on the coast to the southwest, maintain a large tablet documenting some of their stories.  Of course, I'll reimburse you if you're able to bring any of these stories back to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Bloodscalp Lore Tablet from the Bal'lal Ruins in Northern Stranglethorn.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you make it down to Bal'lal Ruins yet?  Did you find the tablet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>To be honest, I'm sending this information home to Stormwind, for my wife and son.  They love to hear about what I've been doing out here in the jungle, and I only get to visit so often.  Every little bit helps.$b$bThank you, $n.</RewardText>
