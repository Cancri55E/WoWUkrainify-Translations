I hope you don't mind.$b$bThose dastardly Venture Company geologists have been collecting some tumbled crystals that will suffice for what I need.  You'll find them around their Base Camp, on the other side of Lake Nazferiti, to the east.$b$bI don't care what you have to do to get them. </Description>
