  <Title>Mosh'Ogg Handiwork</Title>
  <Description>This ogre was carrying an unusual item: the severed hand of another ogre, tied to a piece of string, and worn around the neck.  The hand itself is marked heavily with scars that glow a faint purple.$b$bA scar that glows after death is highly unusual, and to find such an item on an ogre is even stranger.  Perhaps someone back at Grom'gol will know what to do with this oddity.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Disfigured Mosh'Ogg Hand to Far Seer Mok'thardin at Grom'Gol Base Camp in Northern Stranglethorn.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>A hand, you say?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The Far Seer makes sure to hold the item by the string, carefully avoiding the dead ogre's fist.&gt;$b$bStrange indeed.  I will pass this on to my contacts in the east, near the Mosh'Ogg's main camp.  I have a feeling that they'll be interested in these strange scars.$b$bYou have my thanks, $r.</RewardText>
