  <Title>Spared from Madness</Title>
  <Description>Kurzen's death is a relief, but what's more interesting, and perhaps more immediate, is the sign of some potential allies within the compound.$b$bI don't care what it says on that prison record, I know EXACTLY why those 3 were locked up: refusal to follow orders.  They must have been spared from the madness, much like my fellow rebels here, and incarcerated for speaking up.$b$bFind them, $n.  Find them, and send them back here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rescue Berrin Burnquill, Emerine Junis, and Osborn Obnoticus inside Kurzen's Compound.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $n.  It looks like my suspicions were correct... the three prisoners seem to have escaped the affliction that gripped Kurzen and the rest of his men.$b$bBefore you arrived, Emerine teleported them over to Stormwind to get cleaned up after their ordeal.  They promised to return soon.</RewardText>
