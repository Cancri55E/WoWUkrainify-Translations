  <Title>Sacred to the Bloodscalp</Title>
  <Description>Ahh... these must be names of their totemic creatures - the animals that they attribute to the spirits.  Let's see... Mahamba as water, Tsul'Kalu as earth, Pogeyan as... air?  Fire?  I can't make this part out.$b$bI'd like some more information on these spirits of theirs.  The Bloodscalp have a camp close to here, in the Tkashi ruins.  Maybe you can find some details there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain an Icon of Tsul'kalu, an Icon of Mahamba, and an Icon of Pogeyan from Bloodscalp trolls in the Tkashi Ruins.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It's likely that these totemic creatures are based on some of the fantastic creatures that roam this jungle.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>First you save me from the madman's jail cell, and now you bring me some keys to understanding trollish shamanism.$b$bThis is turning out to be a pretty good week!$b$bThank you again, $n.  I will see to it that you have the support of the Wildhammer clan as you continue on your journeys.</RewardText>
