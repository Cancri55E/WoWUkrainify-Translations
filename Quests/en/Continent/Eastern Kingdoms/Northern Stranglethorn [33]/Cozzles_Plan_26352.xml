  <Title>Cozzle's Plan</Title>
  <Description>I may be of Darkspear birth, but I spent my childhood here, in Stranglethorn Vale.  I've seen everything there is to see here in Stranglethorn, but the most offensive is the devastation that the Venture Company has done to the riverbed.$b$bTo make things worse, Foreman Cozzle and his crew have been increasing their activity, and I suspect they have some new plan.  Succeed where I failed, $n: Kill Cozzle, obtain his key, and steal the blueprints from his apartment.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Obtain Cozzle's Key from Foreman Cozzle, then obtain the Fuel Regulator Blueprints.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The Venture Company's acts against Stranglethorn cannot be forgiven.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>A fuel regulator?  This seems important.  At least, I hope it is.$b$bWe may not have ended the Venture Company's operations, but we at least slowed them down.  Thank you, $n.</RewardText>
