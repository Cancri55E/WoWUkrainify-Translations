  <Title>Excelsior</Title>
  <Description>With the inside finished, all that's left is to add the outer layer. For this, I use only the best elder croc skins. They are more durable and a better canvas--if you will--for adding the designs and accents that make Drizzlik's Excelsior line.$b$bIt's hard to find that perfect skin though, the only one that fits my plan is the skin of an elder snapjaw crocolisk.  Find them to the south, near the border with the cape.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring an Elder Crocolisk Skin to Drizzlik at Nesingwary's Expedition.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I read somewhere that the elder crocolisks are slowly dying out... bad news for my business, isn't it?$b$bAnyways, I hope you have that elder snapjaw crocolisk skin for me!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Great! Thanks to your help I'll have this order filled and sent off to Director Riddlevox on the next boat to Undermine. Ahead of schedule, even!$b$bFor all your hard work, here, I made some extras, so take a pair. It's on Drizzlik.$b$bAnd remember, there's no boot so fine as one of Drizzlik's Excelsior line!</RewardText>
