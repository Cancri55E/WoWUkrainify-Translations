  <Title>Water Elementals</Title>
  <Description>I arrived in Stranglethorn to study a feature known as the Altar of Naias, but made the unfortunate choice of denying Colonel Kurzen's advances, which earned me several years in that cage.  Now that I'm out, I figure I might as well continue with my original studies.$b$bThe altar is on an island to the west, south of Zul'Kunda.  Gather some of the bracers from the island's water elementals.$b$bOh, and you can use this device when you're finished.  No need to make you walk all the way back here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Acquire 6 Water Elemental Bracers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Yes, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These will do for my purposes.  Though we can't activate the altar with bracers alone...</RewardText>
