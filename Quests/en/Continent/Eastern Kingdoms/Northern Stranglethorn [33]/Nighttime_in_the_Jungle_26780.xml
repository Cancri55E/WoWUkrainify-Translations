  <Title>Nighttime in the Jungle</Title>
  <Description>Nighttime in Stranglethorn is a beautiful thing.  The skies fill with stars, and the moon casts its rays right between those leaves, right there.  I could stare at these skies all night.$b$bUnfortunately, the trolls that walk the ruins of Zul'Mamwe are interfering with my astronomy.  They burn braziers, day and night, which rob me of the darkness I need.$b$bPlease, $n... travel east into Zul'Mamwe and put them out.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Put out 8 Zul'Mamwe Braziers at Zul'Mamwe in Northern Stranglethorn.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I can see the difference already.  I can't wait until later tonight, when I get to perform my observations again!</RewardText>
