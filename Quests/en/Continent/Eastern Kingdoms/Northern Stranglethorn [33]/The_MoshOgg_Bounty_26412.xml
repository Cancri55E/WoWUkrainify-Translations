  <Title>The Mosh'Ogg Bounty</Title>
  <Description>Say... have you heard about the ogres?  I got a hot tip from some fella' named Mok'thardin that they're hiding some special, magical artifact in their cave.  Skeezy knows better, though.  I can smell money from a Mulgore mile away, and I'll bet that ogre doodad's worth a fortune.$b$bHere's a hint: I've seen them guarding a chest up in some ruins behind their mound.  Care to fetch it for me?</Description>
