  <Title>Rebels Without a Clue</Title>
  <Description>Several years ago, Stormwind's Captain Kurzen brought a brigade into Stranglethorn Vale on a mission whose details are still murky.  Kurzen swiftly descended into madness, as did his men... except for a few rebels who made it their mission to undo the evils that Kurzen had wrought.$b$bAs I said, that was years ago.  I'm now hearing rumors that Kurzen is dead, but those rebels still persist at their rebellion.  If you wish to investigate, you'll find them at a camp on Stranglethorn's northern border.</Description>
