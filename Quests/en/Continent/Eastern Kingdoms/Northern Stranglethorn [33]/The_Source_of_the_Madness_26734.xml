  <Title>The Source of the Madness</Title>
  <Description>After reducing the basilisk blood out of the elixir, I've uncovered an unusual precipitate.  It appears to be a blue crystal of some sort...$b$b&lt;Brother Nimetz consults his notes.&gt;$b$bIt's not a singing blue crystal... not a pulsing blue shard...$b$b&lt;He flips forward a few pages.&gt;$b$b... not a piece of the Mind's Eye.  Nope, this isn't something we've seen before in Stranglethorn.  If anyone has any more of this substance, I want it.  Check the high-ranking Kurzen troops, in the back of their cave.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain a Whispering Blue Stone from Kurzen troops within the Stockpile.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Make sure you handle that stuff carefully, $n.  We don't know what it is.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Brother Nimetz opens up a pouch and lets you place the crystal inside.&gt;$b$bI knew they'd have some more of this substance.  I'm going to send this to my contacts at Fort Livingston, to the south.  Hopefully they'll have some more luck with it.$b$bThank you for everything, $n.</RewardText>
