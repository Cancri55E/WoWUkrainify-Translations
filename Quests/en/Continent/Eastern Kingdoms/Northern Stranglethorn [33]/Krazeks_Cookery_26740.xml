  <Title>Krazek's Cookery</Title>
  <Description>I do most of the cooking at the camp.  It used to be a lot of work, until I bought a mechanical cooking pot from a goblin merchant.  The pot is a wonder!  It saved me countless hours...until it broke!$B$BCan you take the pot back to the goblin for me so he can fix it?  His name is Krazek.  Last I heard, he was staying with Nesingwary in the hunters' camp just to the south.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Krazek's Crock Pot to Krazek.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hello!  You brought me something?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Oh I see, it's a Krazek's Crock Pot!  An ingenious piece of work, but it can break a spring or throw a gear now and then.  Let me see what's wrong with this one...$B$BAha!  Its steam charger is rusted out, it has a cracked knuckle-gasket and its fobulator is missing teeth.  I'm surprised the pot could even boil a turnip in this state!$B$BCan I fix it?  Of course I can fix it!$B$BBut there's a price.  Oh yes, there is always a price...</RewardText>
