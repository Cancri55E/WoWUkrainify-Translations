  <Title>The Universal Key</Title>
  <Description>We're going to need something even stronger than those beefy $r hands of yours to open this.  And the Venture Company schlubs to the northwest might have just the thing.$b$bLast time I was over there, I saw shredders walking around with giant rotating blades on their hands.  That's one way to open a box!$b$bIf you can't find any shredders, you might also try the giant sawblade in their lumber mill, by the lake.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Open the Mosh'Ogg Bounty by fighting a Venture Co. Shredder or by using the sawblade in the Venture Company lumber mill.</LogDescription>
