  <Title>The Mosh'Ogg Bounty</Title>
  <Description>Say... have you heard about the ogres?  I got a hot tip from some fella' named Mok'thardin that some $r schmuck in a ridiculous $c getup found this ogre hand, and...$b$b&lt;Skeezy trails off as he looks you over.&gt;$b$bWhat was I just saying?  Oh yes... some $g SWASHBUCKLING HERO: BREATHTAKING HEROINE; found this ogre hand, and Mok'thardin thinks it means that the ogres have some special artifact.  I've seen them guarding a chest up in some ruins behind their mound.  Care to fetch it for me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Mosh'Ogg Bounty from the ruins behind the Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Why is it that the OGRES always find the priceless artifacts?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Skeezy struggles fruitlessly to open the box.&gt;$b$bThose ogres really know how to close a treasure chest, I'll tell you what.  A box is useless to me, $g hero: my dear;.  We're going to need to find a way into this crate.</RewardText>
