  <Title>The Mind's Eye</Title>
  <Description>The Mind's Eye is held by an ogre mage, in the Mosh'Ogg ogre mound just to the south.  His name is Mai'Zoth.  I know him from when the Darkspears dwelt in Stranglethorn - he is vicious, and his magic is strong.$B$BAnd if he has the Mind's Eye, then his magic will be stronger still.$B$BYou must face Mai'Zoth and wrest from him the Mind's Eye.  It is a perilous task, but it is the only hope we have of saving Yenniku.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Mind's Eye from Mai'Zoth.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Greetings, $n.  The spirits sing praise of your bravery, yet they tell me no tales of your quest against Mai'Zoth.$B$BDo you have the Eye?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You retrieved the eye!  Your might is the stuff of legends, $n!$B$BAnd in getting the Eye, you must have defeated Mai'Zoth and sent him to the Nether.  That is why the spirits would not mention him before.$B$BIt is good that he is gone from the world of flesh and bone, but now that he is in the realm of spirits...I fear he will begin a new reign.$B$BBut that is a worry for another time.</RewardText>
