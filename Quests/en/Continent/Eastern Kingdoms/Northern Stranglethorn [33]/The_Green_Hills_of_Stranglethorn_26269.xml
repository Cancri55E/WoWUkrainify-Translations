  <Description>One page!  I only need one more page!$b$bMaster Nesingwary's novel ran into a bit of an... accident &lt;Barnil shoots an accusing glance over at Spanks&gt;... and we misplaced some of the pages.$b$bI've been asking your fellow adventurers to look for the missing pages, and they've been quite helpful, but one page still eludes me.$b$bI'm sure you're awfully busy with other matters, but while you're out in the jungle, would you mind looking for it?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Page 14 of the Green Hills of Stranglethorn.</LogDescription>

It shouldn't be long now until we see Master Nesingwary's book in libraries throughout the world!$B$BI'll leave a copy of the book right here, if you ever want to take a peek at the finished product.  Thanks again, $n!</RewardText>
