  <RewardText>&lt;You explain to Ghaliri what has happened up to this point.&gt;$b$bIt would seem that Jin'do has survived, and he is rallying his brothers to once again summon Hakkar into this world.  It was good of you to come to speak with me.$b$bThere is not much we can do now but to wait, and watch.
