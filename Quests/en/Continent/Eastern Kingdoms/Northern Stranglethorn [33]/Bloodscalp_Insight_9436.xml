  <Title>Bloodscalp Insight</Title>
  <Description>Well met, $c. I've made a habit of studying the fighting techniques of the various troll tribes in my travels, and I've noticed a trend. The Bloodscalp trolls at the Tkashi Ruins and Bal'lal Ruins to the north use some of the same tactics as the Amani of the northern forests.$B$BTheir magic seems to have diverged in an interesting direction and they've used it to become the strongest tribe in the area. It could form the core of a powerful weapon against the Amani, but first I must find out more about it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Nemeth Hawkeye at Grom'gol Base Camp wants you to bring him a Bloodscalp Totem from a Bloodscalp Shaman.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do not fail me, $n. If we can bend this Bloodscalp magic to our will, my people may yet eliminate the Amani threat.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done. Now, this is curious...$B$BThe inscription on this totem is in a language no troll could ever hope to learn, but one that is known to us. It names the bearer as an ally of a water elemental named Naias and marks him as one worthy to channel his power.$B$BThis is most unexpected, but not entirely bad, $n. With your help, I'd like to pursue this further.</RewardText>
