  <Title>The Defense of Grom'gol: Trollish Thievery</Title>
  <Description>The trolls leave us well enough alone here in Grom'gol.  Most trolls know that the Horde can easily crush them when angered, and the trolls here in Stranglethorn are no exception.$b$bThe Bloodscalp have been more active lately, however.  As lately as last week, they sent a party into Grom'gol and stole several cases of rations.$b$bStealing food is the most forgivable type of theft, but I still can't let it happen under my watch.  Head north, to the Bal'lal ruins, and return our property.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Grom'gol Rations from the Bal'lal ruins.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Pity has no place under my command.  The trolls can find food elsewhere.  It's a big jungle.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Aggro'gosh salutes you.&gt;$b$bThe Horde thanks you, $n.  Grom'gol is protected, if only for today.</RewardText>
