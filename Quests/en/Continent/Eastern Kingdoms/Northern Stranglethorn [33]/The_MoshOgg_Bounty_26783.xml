  <Title>The Mosh'Ogg Bounty</Title>
  <Description>There's been some activity up north, at the rebel camp.  I just heard from a soldier named Nimetz that a $r $c up there found the key to what's been driving them so crazy.  That wasn't you, was it?$b$bAnyhow, he sent a sample to me, and it looks just like the rocks I've been seeing over at the Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound, to the northeast.$b$bI've heard that the ogres are guarding a chest up in some ruins behind their mound.  I suspect it may be related.  Care to fetch it for me?</Description>
