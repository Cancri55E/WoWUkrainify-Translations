  <Title>The Shrine of Dath'Remar</Title>
  <Description>Day after day I stand here, watching, waiting.  I've been accused of dwelling too much on our past, while my eyes look to the horizon.  But it is my firm belief that each visitor to this island should honor those who have sacrificed all so that they may continue to do so.$B$BDath'Remar Sunstrider was our first king.  He led us here from Kalimdor through the Maelstrom.$B$BSeek out his shrine to the west and do not return to me until you have read the plaque upon it in his honor.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Read the plaque on the Shrine of Dath'Remar and then return to Well Watcher Solanian at the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you read the plaque on the shrine then, $c?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah, $n - thank you for sharing your experience at the Shrine of Dath'Remar.  First off, you should be commended for your sense of duty and respect - it will serve you well not only here, but in all of Azeroth as well.$B$BAs for the odd sensation, it is no doubt a contributing part of the taint that has befallen Sunstrider Isle.  We shall keep an eye on it; thank you for alerting us to it!</RewardText>
