  <Title>Thirst Unending</Title>
  <Description>If there is only one lesson you deign to remember from your time on Sunstrider Isle, let it be this - control your thirst for magic.  It is a thirst unending, $n - what you absorb must be controlled and released via Arcane Torrent.  Failure is to become one of the Wretched... hopelessly addicted and insane.$B$BSeek out a mana wyrm and unleash your Arcane Torrent upon it.  Learn to master your power. When you have sufficiently released an Arcane Torrent, return to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use your Arcane Torrent racial ability on a Mana Wyrm, then return to Arcanist Helion.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It is not an option or a choice... you must quench your magical thirst.  To fail in this is to fail as a blood elf.  Those who thought they could control their needs without tutoring now find themselves as one of the Wretched.$B$BYou do NOT want to end up as an insane addict.  Believe me.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You've done well today, $n.  Your willingness to learn shows that you may very well rise above the unyielding cravings you must endure as a blood elf.$B$BRest not on your laurels, young one, but instead seek to master what you have learned.  Only through diligence will we as a race survive.$B$BTake this - it may be of some use to you.  Go now, and bring glory once more to our people.</RewardText>
