Lanthan will explain fully when you speak to him.$B$BSimply walk west of here along the path, and you should see him standing close by.$B$BGood luck, $n - your continued successes shall be rewarded.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Lanthan Perilon on Sunstrider Isle; he is standing close to the path running west away from the Sunspire.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Magistrix Erona told me you'd be along quick enough, $n.  The Falthrien Academy to our west - the huge floating building with the ornate spires - is in bad shape.  You're going to be leading the effort to recapture it from one of the Wretched - a blood elf who has forever succumbed to their basest cravings.$B$BI hope you're ready to work.  This is not only going to be a lesson about danger, but also of what happens when you forsake the realities of who you are.</RewardText>
