  <Title>A Fistful of Slivers</Title>
  <Description>It's a shame that we've lost control of many of the creatures here on the island.  This was once a tranquil place of study and research.  Now it's all we can do to keep from being attacked by our own creations!$B$BI'm going to offer you a chance to receive a magical boon in exchange for some collecting work on your part.  Bring me a stack of arcane slivers that are found on the mana-using creatures of Sunstrider Isle, and I will cast a spell on you that should aid your adventures on the isle.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 6 Arcane Slivers from any creature on the isle that uses mana, and then return to Arcanist Ithanas on Sunstrider Isle.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Many of the creatures here on the isle were at one point bound into non-aggression and complacency by our magical skills.  When the Scourge destroyed the Sunwell, our hold over these creatures shattered.  Arcane slivers are the remnants of the control we once had, and as such might be usable in fashioning a new device to aid us in regaining their control.$B$BBetter still, perhaps the slivers could be used to see what malaise the isle truly suffers under...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Splendid - these will do nicely.  I've been doing quite a bit of thinking on the current malaise Sunstrider Isle suffers under.  One possible course of action I had pondered was to collect these arcane slivers from the beasts on the isle.  In doing so, they could be experimented on; this would provide a potential source of culpability.$B$BAnyway, I will tend to the research.  Allow me to place this incantation on you.  I believe you'll make good use of it!</RewardText>
