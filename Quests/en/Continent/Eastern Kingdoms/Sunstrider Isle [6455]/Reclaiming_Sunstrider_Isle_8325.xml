  <Title>Reclaiming Sunstrider Isle</Title>
  <Description>The sooner you begin your education, $n, the better for us all.  There is little room for error, so listen closely.$B$BThe Burning Crystals - the green floating objects to the west of the Sunspire here - have long been used to power the isle's experimentations.  The mana wyrms were their guardians, but the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas has driven them errant from our lack of magical control over them.$B$BThere is little choice but to thin their numbers for reclamation.  Do this, then return to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 6 Mana Wyrms; they are located close to the Burning Crystals that are adjacent to the tower and gazebo.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Our work in rebuilding our society begins here, $n.  Once we are able to secure our home, we can look outward and upward.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You have successfully completed your first task; for that, you are to be congratulated.  Such success gives me faith that you will turn out better than those young blood elves who fail to heed the lessons of their masters.  Continued success will be rewarded - not only with knowledge, but also with tangible rewards as well.$B$BYour work here, however, is not finished.  There is much more to learn, my young friend...</RewardText>
