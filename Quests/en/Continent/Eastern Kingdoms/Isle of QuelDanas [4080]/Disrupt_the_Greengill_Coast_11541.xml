  <Title>Disrupt the Greengill Coast</Title>
  <Description>The naga have taken the Greengill Coast to the southeast. Their females, the Darkspine sirens, are using magic to enslave the indigenous murlocs.$B$BIt's my responsibility to see to it that whatever the naga are up to over there is disrupted. That's where you come in.$B$B$C, I want you to get the controlling orbs from the female naga and throw them near the Greengill slaves, breaking the orb and setting the murlocs free.$B$BMy guess is that the murlocs will be incensed and turn on their masters.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Captain Valindria wants you to free 10 Greengill Slaves. Return to her onboard the Silvermoon's Pride at Sun's Reach Harbor once you have done so.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>My scouts tell me that there hasn't yet been enough disruption of the naga today.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That's enough for today. Slow and steady is the key here. Too much disruption and they'd turn their attention directly upon us; something that we don't want.$B$BCome back again tomorrow and we'll work on it some more.</RewardText>
