  <Title>Making Ready</Title>
  <Description>Supplies are inbound, or so I'm told.$b$bRegardless, we can ill afford to wait around hoping that help arrives before our offensive stalls. We must make the best of what we have.$b$bAs for me, I need ore to fashion an anvil so I can begin to upgrade our armor and weapons.$b$bThere are a group of naga on the coast to the east of here collecting ore and placing it in chests for shipment to the Legion.$b$bRelieving them of their ore will help our efforts in more ways than one....</Description>
  <LogDescription>Smith Hauthaa in Sun's Reach Armory wants you to kill Darkspine Myrmidon to the east and use their keys to steal three pieces of the ore from their chests.</LogDescription>
