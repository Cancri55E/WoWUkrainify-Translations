To compound the strain, we've had to dispatch a contingent to Azeroth to investigate developments at the Sunwell Plateau.$b$bYou are needed there, $n. Report to Larethor. Tell him that I wish we could spare more men.</Description>

Whatever's going on out here won't wait for us to make ready.$b$bHave a look around, $c. There's much that needs doing. Pitch in and do your share.$b$bOh, yeah, and don't go tauntin' the cryers - err, Scryers. Looks like we're in this thing together....</RewardText>
