  <Title>Murder Was The Case That They Gave Me</Title>
  <Description>Here's the deal, kid, we've got a full-blown murder on our hands. Double homicide... Single horse... icide.$B$BWorse yet, we're in Westfall. I could throw a rock behind me and hit a dozen hobos with motive enough to want to wipe these people (and horse) out.$B$BNow I don't know who did this and I sure don't appreciate having to come to this dump to investigate the deaths of a couple of squatters, but I'll be damned if I don't find the perp. You want to help? Go talk to some bums. The hobo... knows.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to the various homeless people occupying the Jansen Stead to gather clues about the Furlbrow murders.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Gnolls and murlocs? Horse poopy, $g pal:lady;! Gnolls and murlocs didn't kill these people. I've seen what gnolls and murlocs do to people that they kill and this... isn't it. Too pretty. Too... perfect.$B$BFurthermore, the Furlbrow's had been squatting on this farm for 5 years. No, whoever wiped them out had a reason. This is murder, plain and simple and we're gonna get to the bottom of it...</RewardText>
