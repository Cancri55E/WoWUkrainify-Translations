  <Title>"I TAKE Candle!"</Title>
  <Description>Back before those damned kobolds gave me a permanent limp I used to be William Pestle's number one candle supplier. Hell, I even came up with the line "I TAKE CANDLE!" Yea, that was me. Kobold would say "You no take candle!" and I'd just respond "I TAKE CANDLE!" and then bash their brains in!$B$B&lt;Jimb drifts off for a second.&gt;$B$BGood times... The best times.$B$BNow? Can't even use the bathroom without assistance. You want to help me? Kill me some kobolds. You'll find a good load of 'em in the nearby mine.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 12 Kobold Diggers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Oh SWEET justice! Killin' those kobolds won't make me walk like a normal person and it sure won't get me a job, but damn does it feel good.$B$B&lt;Jimb reaches into a crusty old sack.&gt;$B$BHere, I think I got somethin' for you from my kobold huntin' days. Maybe you can put it to good use.</RewardText>
