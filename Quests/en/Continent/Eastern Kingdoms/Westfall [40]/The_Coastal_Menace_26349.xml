  <Title>The Coastal Menace</Title>
  <Description>When my life was ended upon the rocks, I had no clue what the afterlife held for me.  The Lighthouse was black that night because Old Murk-Eye had scared the keeper's family off.  They returned and re-lit the flame but Old Murk-Eye coerced the weaker minded murlocs to raid the Lighthouse with him once again.  The second time the family was not so lucky and before my eyes they perished helplessly.$b$bSlay Old Murk-Eye if you see him along the shore and bring me one of his scales and I shall reward you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring a scale of Old Murk-Eye to Captain Grayson at the Westfall Lighthouse.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you laid waste to the menace known as Old Murk-Eye yet?  He has been spotted roaming the coastline of Westfall.$b$bReturn to me when the foul beast is dead.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>So the foul heathen, Murk-Eye is dead.  Well done, $n.  By your hands one life was laid to rest but perhaps many more were saved.  The Great Sea, wrought with danger as it is, shall be a wee bit safer this night thanks to your heroics.</RewardText>
