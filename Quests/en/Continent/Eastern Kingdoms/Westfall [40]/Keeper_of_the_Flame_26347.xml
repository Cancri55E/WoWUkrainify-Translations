  <Title>Keeper of the Flame</Title>
  <Description>The night the Lighthouse Keeper's family died was horrible.  I watched, helpless, as Old Murk-Eye led the attack.  But what's done is done and now my concern is for the lives of the sailors on The Great Sea whose ships come close to the perilous rocks of the coastline.  With no one to keep watch on the flame the responsibility has fallen upon me.$b$bHelp me keep the torch lit by bringing me chasm ooze from the slimes in the Raging Chasm to the northeast.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 5 Chasm Oozes to Captain Grayson at the Westfall Lighthouse.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The flame will not burn for long without ooze, $n. We used to use oil back in the day, but it was hard to come by!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Praise you, brave $C.  The rocks of the Westfall Coast shall be lit thanks to your hard work.  Many lives will be spared so long as the torch is kept lit.$b$bI died needlessly on this very shore.  My afterlife plight is to see that no others follow my destiny.</RewardText>
