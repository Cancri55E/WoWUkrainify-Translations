  <Title>The Westfall Brigade</Title>
  <Description>We were once known as the People's Militia. These days, though, we fight under the banner of Stormwind, with the full support of King Anduin Wrynn. Our goals here in Westfall are many: to clean up the mess left behind by the Defias, to expand the reach of the Alliance and to maintain order. So far we are failing on all fronts.$B$BTimes are worse now than when the Defias ran amok. Now with the indigenous gnolls of the region up in arms, we find ourselves backed into a corner. Help us, $n!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay any 12 Riverpaw Gnolls attacking Sentinel Hill.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n. You have provided us a temporary reprieve from the onslaught of gnolls, but there is more work to be done.</RewardText>
