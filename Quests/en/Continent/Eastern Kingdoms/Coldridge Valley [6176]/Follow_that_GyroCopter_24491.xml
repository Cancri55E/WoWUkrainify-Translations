  <Title>Follow that Gyro-Copter!</Title>
  <Description>D-d-did you see that?  How the whole cave just crumbled like that?  I guess it's good that you got here when you did, and not a minute earlier.$b$bWhile this development makes my job of monitoring the cave entrance much easier, I imagine it makes it a lot harder for you to get to Kharanos.$b$bHey wait, I've got an idea!  The Gnomeregan Airmen have a flight path not far from here.  I'll send up a signal, and they should be here to help.  I imagine they'll land back over at Anvilmar.</Description>
