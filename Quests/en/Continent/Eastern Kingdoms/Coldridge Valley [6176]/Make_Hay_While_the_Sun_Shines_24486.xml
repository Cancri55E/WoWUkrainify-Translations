  <Title>Make Hay While the Sun Shines</Title>
  <Description>The trogg village to the southwest suffered similar damage to ours.  One would assume, logically, that there would be some trogg artifacts sticking out of the ground, too!$b$bUnfortunately, it looks like most of the artifacts have already been scooped up by trogg scavengers.  Please, go see if you can find some way to get them back.  Believe it or not, knowledge about troggs may eventually lead to further knowledge about the mighty dwarves!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 5 Priceless Rockjaw Artifacts from Rockjaw Scavengers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you manage to pry any artifacts from the troggs?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well would you look at this!  An axe blade, a couple of arrowheads, and what appears to be some sort of rudimentary spoon.  This is indeed fascinating.$b$bThanks again for your help, $n.  I've much studying to keep myself occupied while Joren's got us under lockdown.</RewardText>
