  <Title>First Things First: We're Gonna Need Some Beer</Title>
  <Description>I don't know how ANYONE expects to get any work done around here if we don't have any ale!  Our beer level here in Anvilmar is dangerously low.$b$bLucky for us, we've stowed some backup kegs for just such an occasion.  West of Anvilmar, along the valley's northern border, ye'll find kegs of Stormhammer Stout and Theramore Pale Ale.  Just to the east of here, ye'll find a stash of Gnomenbrau.  That's me personal favorite.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain a Cask of Stormhammer Stout, a Cask of Theramore Pale Ale, and a Cask of Gnomenbrau.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The ale, darling, the ale!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Jona drinks deeply from the Gnomenbrau.&gt;$b$bAhh... that hits the spot.  Now we can get some work done around here.</RewardText>
