Then we had this ridiculous earthquake, and I got all turned around.  I ended up here, and what's worse: the trolls stole all my stuff!$b$b$n, I've obviously proven myself to be quite incompetent over the last day and a half.  Would you mind infiltrating the troll camps southwest of here and returning my stuff to me?</Description>
