  <Title>The Troll Menace</Title>
  <Description>The trolls're acting up.  More than usual, I'd say.  We've seen them put together war parties before, but this time it's... different.$b$bWhat matters most, however, is the continued protection of Anvilmar.  I've no intention to let these trolls flank Anvilmar while its attention is turned towards troggs.  Go thin their ranks a bit.  They need to know that we're still not without defenses.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Frostmane Troll Whelps.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>From what I've learned, these trolls hail from the Frostmane clan. I'm afraid I don't know much else about them that would be of any use to you, $N.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hopefully that did the trick.  Anvilmar will be safe from trolls for the time being.  Now, to find out what it is that has the trolls so agitated.</RewardText>
