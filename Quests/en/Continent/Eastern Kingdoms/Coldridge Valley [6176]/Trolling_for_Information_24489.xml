  <Title>Trolling for Information</Title>
  <Description>I'm notoriously bad at reading troll facial expressions.  That being said, these trolls don't look angry to me.  They seem to be confused... maybe a little frightened.$b$bSomething happened that we're not seeing here, $n.  I say we do some investigation before we just kill every troll in sight.$b$bThere are three troll camps in the area: one to the southeast, one to the southwest, and one due west.  Each camp has a soothsayer... see if you can get close enough to listen to what they're saying.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Stand near a Frostmane Soothsayer in each of the Frostmane camps and listen to what they have to say.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Hmm... interesting.  From what you're saying, it sounds like a fire elemental might have snuck in from Searing Gorge.  Or, the earthquake opened up a crack to the elemental plane...$b$b&lt;Soren laughs uncomfortably.&gt;$b$bEither way, this is bad news.  You should probably report this information to Grelin.</RewardText>
