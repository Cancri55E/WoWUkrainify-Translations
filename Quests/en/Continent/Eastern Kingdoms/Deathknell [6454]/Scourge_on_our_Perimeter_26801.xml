  <Description>If you're going to be an asset to the Forsaken, you need to learn how to fight.  And there's no better target than the Scourge minions that continue to pester us.$B$BThe wretched ghouls and Rattlecage skeletons that roam the north and to the east are former troopers of the fallen Scourge.  They should prove to be an even match for a fledgling $c like you.$b$bDo not tarry - when you are done, speak to me again.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 undead outside of Deathknell.  You may kill either Wretched Ghouls or Rattlecage Skeletons.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Those who dally in this task might as well end up wandering about aimlessly like our fallen brothers and sisters in the village.  Let's hope you will fare better than them, yes? </CompletionText>
