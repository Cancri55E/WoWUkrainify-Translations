  <Description>King, peasant, or $c... I don't care WHAT you were before.  I just need somebody with a working tongue.$b$bBeing raised from the dead is strenuous.  Not everyone copes with it as well as you did.  In particular, there are three newly-raised undead who are having trouble coping right now.$b$bI want you to find them and talk to them.  It might be that they just need someone that they can relate with.$b$bYou'll find them here in the graveyard.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Marshal Redpath, Lilian Voss, and Valdred Moray.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>No dilly-dallying now.  You're among the Forsaken now, and we hold ours to a higher standard.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You've done well, $c.  As you can see, not all of us have resigned to our fates.  I'm glad to see that you're at least willing to work.$b$bValdred will be a valuable asset to the Forsaken.  As for the other two... there is not much we can do.  We cannot force them to join us.</RewardText>
