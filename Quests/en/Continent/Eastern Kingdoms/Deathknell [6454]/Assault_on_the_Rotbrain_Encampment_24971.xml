  <Title>Assault on the Rotbrain Encampment</Title>
  <Description>While you were taking care of matters for Executor Arren, I went off on an assignment of my own.  Shadow Priest Sarvis asked me to peek in on the Rotbrain camp.$b$bThere's a reason why they're called Rotbrains.$b$bTheir leader goes by the name of Marshal Redpath, and he's an absolute beast.$b$bLook, $n... the attack is starting.  You're better in combat than I am.  Get in there and help out!$b$bWhen you're done, meet up with Shadow Priest Sarvis in the chapel.  Good luck, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Marshal Redpath and 8 Rotbrain undead.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Being born again under the power of a val'kyr is a strenuous process.  Many don't survive the shock, turning into zombies or ghouls.$b$bOthers retain just enough humanity to seem normal on the outside... but they're sick inside.  We should have slain those rotbrains the day they were raised.$b$bAs for you... you're a strong $c, $n.  I knew you'd do well.  You'll be headed out of Deathknell soon.</RewardText>
