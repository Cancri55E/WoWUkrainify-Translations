Still, I don't get why he'd be sendin' an outsider to be recruitin' me - not right polite by my standards.$B$BI'm guessin' ya don't last 20 seconds with any of my boys, at the bar or in the battlefield. Prove me wrong. Take one of'm down in a fight and then I'll think about flyin' with ol' Keegan.</Description>
