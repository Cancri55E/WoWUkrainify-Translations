  <Description>I'm new to this gig. Very new. But ya know what? That gives me perspective!$B$BThese shaman buddies of mine have come upon somethin' great, but they're too single minded! They lean on the elements and they forget to make use of the common materials all around them.$B$BIn the ruins to the south, I saw those Twilight goons tote in barrels of flammable oil! They used it when they razed the town. I say we use it when we raze them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 10 barrels of Pyreburn Oil.</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>Now that's what I'm talkin' about! Can you think of all the uses for this stuff? I definitely can't. But I can think of a lot, and I'm liking the possibilities.</RewardText>
