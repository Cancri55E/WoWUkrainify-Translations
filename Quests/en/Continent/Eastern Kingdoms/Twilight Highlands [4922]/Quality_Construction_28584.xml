  <Description>Look here, chief, if it weren't for this bumbly idiot across from me, the Krazzworks would be holding up just fine.$B$BUnfortunately for everyone involved, "Fancypants" Rothman here decided to deploy the place on top of a mountain! I mean really, who does that?$B$BSo, we got leaks all over the place due to faulty valves. Think you could take this blast tape and seal 'em up for me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Blast Tape to seal 10 Faulty Valves.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Look, I'm just a simple cartographer, but according to my estimates, not to mention what my eyes are telling me, there are a few more faulty valves that need to be sealed.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There you go. Now hows about we use this blast tape on Rothman's mouth?</RewardText>
