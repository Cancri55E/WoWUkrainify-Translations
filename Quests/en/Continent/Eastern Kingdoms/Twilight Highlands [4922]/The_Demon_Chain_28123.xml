  <Description>Narkrall revealed to me the secret of his influence over the drakes in this area. I thought the Demon Chain was a myth, but he's had it all along.$B$BAnd now the fool is about to lose it!$B$BHis life is meaningless to me but the Dragonmaw can't afford to lose that artifact. Follow him north, up to Thundermar. The city will be in chaos, so you may be able to land undetected. Return to me with the Demon Chain, even if you have to remove it from Narkrall's corpse.$B$BFind that artifact, $n!</Description>

  <RewardText>&lt;Zaela takes the gore-spattered length of chain and wraps it around her hand and wrist.&gt;$B$BIf the stories are true, $n, it was on this length of chain that Deathwing had once fastened the Demon Soul, forged in his bid to control the other dragonflights.
