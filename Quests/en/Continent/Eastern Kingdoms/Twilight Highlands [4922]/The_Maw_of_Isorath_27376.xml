  <Description>We are ready to attack the beast. First, we need to destroy it's tentacles, then Yevaa will perform a ritual to summon a powerful fire elemental that we will drop into its maw.$B$BI want you to fly out with our first group attack. Hold steady until an opportunity presents itself, then join the battle with the rest of the shaman in cutting the tentacles down.$B$BTake any one of the gryphons when you're ready to join the assault.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Mount a gryphon to join the attack on Iso'rath.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The tentacles swept us off of our gryphons as well! They were far more nimble than we anticipated.$B$BNo matter. We were prepared for this possibility. I can summon the elemental from here if you can keep me safe.</RewardText>
