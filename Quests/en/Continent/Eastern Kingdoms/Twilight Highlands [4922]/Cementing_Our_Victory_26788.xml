  <Title>Cementing Our Victory</Title>
  <Description>Our alliance with the Dragonmaw is secured, but this port is far from combat ready. These flimsy wooden walls are an embarrassment to the Warchief.$B$BWhen water elementals carve their way through rock, as they have in the Verrall River, they create a peculiar kind of muck. It spreads easily and dries harder than the hardest stone. It's the perfect mortar for large-scale construction.$B$BGo to the river delta northwest of here and collect some Verrall River muck. Even a little will go a long way.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 piles of Verrall River Muck.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the mud? Construction of the new walls has already begun!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Ornak allows the muck to drip from his fingertips.&gt;$B$BNow that's the stuff! I'll start mixing and diluting this with gravel and water. Just a few handfuls of this can enhance enough cement for an entire stone tower.$B$BWe've got big plans for this port, $n. You'll see!</RewardText>
