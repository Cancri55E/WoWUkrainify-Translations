  <Title>Any Portal in a Storm</Title>
  <Description>Our friends in the Earthen Ring have been trying to open portals back to Stormwind, with no luck. But Thordun here tells me he might just have the key.$B$BThe crazed water elementals in the nearby Verrall River Delta have been sent into a frenzy. Thordun tells me we can channel their energy into a portal.$B$BI don't understand all this elemental-claptrap, but I understand one thing: killin' elementals and takin' their whirlpool cores. Deliver them to Talaa in the courtyard! </Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Muddied Water Elementals to collect 5 Whirlpool Cores.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hello, $c. Kurdran tells me you've got a solution to getting this portal opened?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>My word, $n. These elemental energies are so powerful, so chaotic - no wonder the Twilight's Hammer has chosen to build their stronghold here!$B$BI should be able to channel these energies into something more benign and productive though. Let's give it a try...</RewardText>
