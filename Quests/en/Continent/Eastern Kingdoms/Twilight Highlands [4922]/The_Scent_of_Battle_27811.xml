  <Title>The Scent of Battle</Title>
  <Description>Don't let Duglas fool you, the Mullans have been itchin' to take wing again, and if there's anyone we'd do it for, it's Firebeard.$B$BWe left our gryphons in the Highland Forest to the south to hunt and to get away from the sounds of battle for a bit. They deserved a rest.$B$BIf you want us back in the air soon, you'd do well to help us bring our gryphons back in.$B$BTake this piece of charred highland birch. We use it during training - as soon as they smell it, they'll come straight back to us.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find 8 Mullan Gryphons and dispatch them back to their gryphon riders.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We're not going to be much use to you without our birds.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good on you. I always feel like a part of me is missing when my gryphon isn't nearby. I can't speak for Duglas or the rest of the clan, but I'll be ready to ride at Firebeard's call.</RewardText>
