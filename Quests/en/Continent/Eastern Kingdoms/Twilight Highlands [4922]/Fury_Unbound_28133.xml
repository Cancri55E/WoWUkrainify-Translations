  <Title>Fury Unbound</Title>
  <Description>Narkrall's drake Torth survived the failed attack on Thundermar, and now the creature is free from his former master.$B$BTorth seeks vengeance against the Dragonmaw, and has already strafed Bloodgulch once. He will keep returning until we skewer him for good. It is time to put the Demon Chain to work.$B$BTorth's old nest is a small cave in the hills west of here that we have turned into a small camp called "The Gullet."$B$BMeet me at the Gullet and we will finish Torth off.</Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>Torth the Ravenous</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>Meet me in the Gullet and we will destroy Torth together.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Travel to the Gullet and speak with Zaela. Kill Torth.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Our dominance over the dragons is both our strength and our curse. Their wrath is a terrible thing to behold.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Once free of the chain, Torth died rather than submit again. I admire the creature. I will have his hide fashioned into a set of armor.$B$BThis much is clear to me now: The Dragonmaw cannot stand alone if the Alliance backs the Wildhammer. Narkrall proved that. And you have proven the might of the Horde, again and again.$B$BI will rebuild our drake wings and take up position outside the Bastion of Twilight. You should continue to help out here in the Gullet and elsewhere in the Highlands.</RewardText>
