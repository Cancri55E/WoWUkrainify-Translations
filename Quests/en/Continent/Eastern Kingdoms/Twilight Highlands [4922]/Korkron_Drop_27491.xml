  <Title>Kor'kron Drop</Title>
  <Description>Garona and a detachment of the Kor'kron are here to assist us with operations up top in the Twilight Citadel. I need you to escort them there.$B$BI've called upon a local tribe of trolls to give us a lift in with their wind riders. The assassins have some things that they need to do down in the Twilight Gate area first, though.$B$BSpeak with the troll chief, Jon-Jon Jellyneck and get yourself a detachment of Kor'kron to drop off. You'll fly them in. A big red X marks the spot.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Get a Crushblow Wind Rider squad from Jon-Jon Jellyneck and then escort them to the drop off point in the Twilight Gate.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I need you to get those Kor'kon assassins safely to their destination, $n.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That must have been exciting.$B$BDespite any losses that the Kor'kron may have incurred along the way, no one will be able to doubt their effectiveness, nor that of Garona. And with you in the mix, it's only a matter of time before victory is ours.</RewardText>
