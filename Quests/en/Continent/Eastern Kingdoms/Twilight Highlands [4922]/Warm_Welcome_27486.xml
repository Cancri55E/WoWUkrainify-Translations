  <Title>Warm Welcome</Title>
  <Description>Good. You're back. Saving the world again I assume.$B$BI was dispatched to establish relations with the red dragons in the area, but I'm finding this bunch somewhat less accommodating than the ones at Wyrmrest were. I have, however, been told that you are the type that solves problems.$B$BA problem solver as it were.$B$BI need you to gain the trust of Lirastrasza at Vermillion Redoubt to the southwest. Our association with the Dragonmaw has complicated things, but I'm hoping you can ease relations.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet with Lirastrasza at Vermillion Redoubt.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'm glad Lira didn't scare you off. I won't say her concerns aren't warranted, but we have a common enemy. She is perhaps a bit overzealous.</RewardText>
