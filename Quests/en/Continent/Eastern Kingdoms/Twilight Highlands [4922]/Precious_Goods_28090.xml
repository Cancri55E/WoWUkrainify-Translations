  <Description>The gates further down the canyon are shut. Our scouting revealed some kind of stone that they carry in chests in their caravans that they use to open the gates.$B$BGet down there and look for a chest key on the bodies of the guards. When you find it, use it on one of those chests on the caravan wagons and bring the gatestone back to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve a Twilight Caravan Gatestone. The Spearwardens should carry keys that can get you into the gatestone chests.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You know, we could probably just blow the gates, but knowing our demoman, we're probably better off dodging the risk.</CompletionText>
