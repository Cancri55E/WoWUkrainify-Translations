  <Title>A Coward's Due</Title>
  <Description>We may be safe here, but there are a lot of Wildhammer who could still use support. Our wing can offer that, but we need to keep bolsterin' our forces if we're going to clear the Twilight completely.$B$BI'm going to have words with Colin Thundermar. Only a coward turns down the callin' of his people, especially in a time this dire.$B$BGo to Thundermar, find Colin and get a real explanation out of'm. I won't be putting up with cowardice in a Wildhammer leader.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Colin Thundermar in Thundermar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Here here, WOT!? He calls ME a COWARD!?$B$BJust like a Firebeard, all hot air and not a lick of sense. I've been bearing the brunt of a Dragonmaw invasion from the south, much of Thundermar is in ruins, and do any of the other clans stick up to help? NO! Ol' Thundermar is on his own he is, and you'd better believe I'm usin' everything in my arsenal just to stem the tide.</RewardText>
