  <Title>Patchwork Command</Title>
  <Description>Recent events make it even more apparent that holing up here and making sporadic attacks isn't enough to keep our kind safe, much less retake Grim Batol. We need to be more aggressive, we need to strike into their heart.$B$BI've agreed to send dragons to the aid of your commanders. They were already hatching a plan to strike at Grim Batol, so you should focus your attention there first.$B$BYou should be able to find Patch in Dragonmaw Pass, in the canyon below us to the south.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Patch in Dragowmaw Pass.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You got the dragons in the game! Good on you.$B$BWe'd already laid out plans for our ambush by the time the dragons contacted us. They're helping by cutting off their retreat.$B$BIt's not too late for you to join in on the fun though. We saved some for you.</RewardText>
