  <Title>How to Maim Your Dragon</Title>
  <Description>&lt;You sling the gore-spattered gryphon corpse over your shoulder, its wings dragging to the ground.&gt;$B$B&lt;Highland Black Drakes roost just southwest of the Crucible of Carnage, along a ring of low mountain peaks.&gt;$B$B&lt;If you drop the gryphon corpse there, a drake is sure to start feeding. With its guard down, you should be able to attack it until it is weak enough to mount and fly.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Lure in a Baited Black Drake, attack it until it is weak, and then ride it back to Bloodgulch. </LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That was an impressive aerial display, $n, but I wish it had come at a better time.$B$BNarkrall is a great warrior, but he's also an impatient fool. He's about to get himself killed ... and we're about to lose one of our most important weapons in the battle for the Highlands!</RewardText>
