  <Title>Purple is Your Color</Title>
  <Description>So far as I can tell, the Glopgut Ogres right outside the cave here have not yet joined up with the Twilight's Hammer. If we're clever, we can turn the two groups against each other.$B$BLet's roll with a little trick I learned in Silithus. First we'll need to put together a set of cultist robes for you.$B$BHead south of here and kill some Twilight Windwarpers in the Twilight Breach. Aside from disrupting whatever they're up to, it'll give you a chance to collect garment scraps.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather up 8 Twilight Garment Scraps.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>This is good, $n. With heroes like you stirring up trouble out here, we'll keep the cult distracted from our main invasion.$B$BDo you have a disguise?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>What did you manage to get? I suppose we can piece something together from this.$B$BAfter all, you're not joining the cult. We just need to fool a few ogres.</RewardText>
