  <Title>Shining Through the Dark</Title>
  <Description>The great petrified tree that lies before us to the south was once a beacon of great life. Our beacon. We lost this forest to the black flight, and it has since been corrupted and petrified. Nearly unredeemable.$B$BBut all is not without hope. I've brought a powerful tool to begin the healing process. The tree may still be saved, with much time and fortune, and with perhaps a little effort from you.$B$BBring this, Alexstrasza's Tear, and use it within the hollowed heart of the tree.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Alexstrasza's Tear within the hollow beneath the Obsidian Tree.</LogDescription>
