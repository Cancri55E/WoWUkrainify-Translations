  <Title>Something Brewed</Title>
  <Description>It would be an insult to celebrate a Wildhammer wedding without drink. Kurdran himself called for a few kegs of rare Thunderbrew Lager to be sent ashore from Highbank, but the caravan can't get through the pass.$B$BFollow the road east of here, around the south side of Thunderstrike Mountain, and catch up with the caravan. Look for a fellow named Hammelhand, and help him get the booze through the pass!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Hammelhand on the road East of Kirthaven, and escort a supply caravan back to town.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is the road clear? Or were the Dragonmaw causing trouble again?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ahh, Russell the Bard is always raving about Thundermar Lager. I guess it doesn't have the kick of a good Wildhammer brew, but he goes on and on about the "body" or "flavor." I guess we'll find out, eh?</RewardText>
