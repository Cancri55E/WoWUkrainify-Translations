  <Description>Shame about the Doyles. It's a fair miracle that as many of us made it out as is though, so can't count it as much of a surprise.$B$BThose louts at Thundermar are cowards. Even after tellin' them it was Keegan askin', they won't set foot outside of their town. I did rope in the Moores though, so that's at least three clans' worth.$B$BKeegan wanted to hear from ya personally when you returned. Go find'm in town.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Keegan Firebeard at Firebeard's Patrol.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It seems you had some luck bringin' riders back. Well timed too - we just pushed the elementals back, so we should have the arm room to lead an attack right away.$B$BThank you, $n. You're a good $r.</RewardText>
