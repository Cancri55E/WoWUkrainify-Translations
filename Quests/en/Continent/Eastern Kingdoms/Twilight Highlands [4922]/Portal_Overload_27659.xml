  <Title>Portal Overload</Title>
  <Description>I used to be the caretaker of the Earthen Ring's portals here. But while we were away helping to save Deepholm, the Twilight's Hammer moved in and corrupted the area.$B$BThey're using powerful ascendants to guard our portals. That's where they've made a critical error.$B$BI want you to go to the portals and use the controllers to overload them. This will unleash all of the portal's energy, debilitating the ascendant. Slay it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Debilitated Apexar, Debilitated Aetheron, and Debilitated Edemantus.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We need those portals shutdown and their ascendant guardians slain, $c.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The last portal is deep within the mine here, but we'll deal with that in a bit.</RewardText>
