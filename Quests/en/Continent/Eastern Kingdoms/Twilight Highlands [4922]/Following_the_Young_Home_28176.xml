  <Title>Following the Young Home</Title>
  <Description>In the southwestern portion of the Obsidian Forest, you will find some of the black egg clutches. Many of the eggs can be hatched at any time with a bit of prodding from the right flame, and as the whelplings hatch, they will cry out and flock for their mother.$B$BDo not worry, if this purging is to be taken to the whelps, that is not a task that I will force on you. I simply want you to let them out and follow them home as they seek their mother. It is she who we must confront.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Mother's Flame on Obsidian Eggs to release whelps. Follow those hatchlings to the lair of their mother.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Lirastraza sent me ahead to the lair, suspecting the black dragon we are seeking may still be here. Judging by the hatchlings, it seems she was not mistaken.</RewardText>
