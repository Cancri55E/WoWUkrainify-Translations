  <Description>The Twilight's Hammer were damn thorough when they sacked our town.  Me and me brothers may well be the only ones that held'm back. I gotta be sure though.$B$BAs you're siftin' through the ruins, keep an eye out for the bodies of me kinsmen. I wanna know if dere were any survivors... or if it seems like some might have gotten away.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search for the bodies of 12 Dunwald Victims.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What's the news, $r?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That many dead, eh? Not seemin' likely that anyone outside of me brothers fought through it then. I guess I already expected as much.$B$BThanks for takin' the time to look for me.</RewardText>
