  <Title>The Crucible of Carnage: The Bloodeye Bruiser!</Title>
  <Description>I was wondering when you'd show up, $n! Having a past champion of the Ring of Blood here will be a huge draw! We're gonna be rich, buddy! RICH!$B$BAnyway, this is some old Dragonmaw fighting pit. Didn't take much modification to tune it up to our uses. I put out a few feelers, and got some heavy hitters from all around Azeroth to join in the carnage. Bout time to make some gold!$B$BYou know the drill, $n. When you're ready, let me know and we'll get this show on the road!</Description>
