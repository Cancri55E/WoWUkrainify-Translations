  <Title>Potential Energy</Title>
  <Description>As you well know, the amount of energy stored in a conventional spring is equal to one half the spring's elasticity times the displacement squared. Unless you're using an elementium spring. Then the numbers get obscene! Mathematically grotesque!$B$BI need some elementium loops for my secret weapon, and it just so happens that Twilight's Hammer cultists use coils like that to bind earth elementals.$B$BFind them on the Obsidian Stoneslaves east of here, in the terrible region known as the Black Breach.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather up 10 Twisted Elementium Coils.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>If you start pulling heaps of elementium coils out of your backpack right now, you're going to make me one happy gnome!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Terrific! These coils will decompress with the force of a thousand suns!$B$BThat's just a rough approximation of course, don't hold me accountable for those numbers.</RewardText>
