  <Title>Blackout</Title>
  <Description>The Twilight Drakehunters used vicious implements to drag our circling drakes from the sky. Hooks that buried into their scales and held the Twilight secure while they brought our kin to the ground.$B$BWe are past the point of peace. Past hope for their redemption. The only mercy we have left to offer the black flight is the oblivion that they so passionately pursue.$B$BUse these hooks to slay the Obsidian Pyrewings to the south. They should allow you much maneuverability in the air if used right.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 8 Obsidian Pyrewings after using the Wyrmhunter Hooks to reach them.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Trust me, I know how distasteful it sounds. We have a grim task ahead of us, but tenderness and sympathy must be put aside in these moments... for the sake of all life.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You seem to have made use of the disturbing implements with ease.$B$BI take solace in knowing that some tools of evil can ultimately still lead to safeguarding life. Nothing is without purpose.</RewardText>
