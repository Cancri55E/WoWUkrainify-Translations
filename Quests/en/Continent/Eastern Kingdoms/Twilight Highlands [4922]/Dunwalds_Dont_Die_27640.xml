  <Title>Dunwalds Don't Die</Title>
  <Description>As I understand it, you're to be looking to bring the Wildhammer clans together with the Alliance for war. Not sure you know what you're gettin' into.$B$BAnyway, if it's battle you're preparin' for, there's definitely one family you want by your side. Head southwest, to the opposite side of the Crucible of Carnage, and there you'll find Clan Dunwald's ruins. They're rightly ravaged, but that's not likely to be stoppin' the Dunwalds. It's just a matter of findin' them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Look for Dunwald family survivors in the Dunwald Ruins.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>If it's Dunwalds you be lookin' for, it's Dunwalds you've found. A couple of'm anyway. I can't find me other brothers for the life of me.</RewardText>
