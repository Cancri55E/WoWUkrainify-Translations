  <Title>The Bachelorette</Title>
  <Description>Firebeard? Marry my sister!? I swear the world's gone mad, $n!$B$BStill, maybe Kurdran is right. A nice normal wedding would ease everyone's mind... and maybe cool off Firebeard a little. It was great to actually work together here against the ogres.$B$BRight then! It's all up to Fanny. Something tells me she won't want to be tied down.$B$BFly back to Kirthaven and see if she's game. I'll finish up the nasty business with the ogres here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Talk to Fanny at Kirthaven in Twilight Highlands.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Fanny throws her arms up, exasperated.&gt;$B$BYou, Kurdran, Firebeard, and now my brother - everyone's got wedding fever!$B$BFine, fine, I'll marry Keegan Firebeard. But only 'cuz he's strong and handsome, with a jaw that can cut gravel and an arse like an anvil. Not for any political reasons.$B$BWe're going to need your help, though. We got a whole lotta wedding to put together, and not a lot of time to do it.</RewardText>
