  <Title>Dressed to Kill</Title>
  <Description>Your disguise is ready, $n. Whenever you go north into Glopgut's Hollow now, your Twilight's Hammer regalia will fool the ogres.$B$BThe rest of the plan is simple: you kill a bunch of Glopgut ogres, and they blame the cult. Are you ready to create some havoc in the ogre camp? I thought so.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Glopgut Ogres. Your Twilight's Hammer disguise will automatically apply while inside Glopgut's Hollow. </LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How is your disguise holding up? And what's happening with those ogres?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hah! I'm sure Twilight's Hammer wanted to number those ogres among their ranks. Now they'll probably have to fight them off instead.$B$BThis is good, $n. With one well-placed $c we managed to do the work of a small army. I'll let Warlord Krogg know of your work here!</RewardText>
