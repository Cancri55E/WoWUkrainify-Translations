  <Title>Hot Stuff</Title>
  <Description>I have a plan to quadruple the recommended torque for a standard speargun of this size, but according to my calculations the act of firing the weapon would shatter the casing. And possibly cleave the planet in two.$B$BI can weld together a chassis 100-times stronger if I had a good source of pure elemental flame for the smelting.$B$BUnbound Emberfiends are roiling around west of here, in the Humboldt Conflagration. Killing them should render them down to pellets of molten fury. Bring me some!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 5 pellets of Molten Fury.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the molten fury? No no, don't put it in my hand. Here, use the tongs!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Marvelous! I'll smelt this down into a delicious soup. An angry soup. Of molten metal.</RewardText>
