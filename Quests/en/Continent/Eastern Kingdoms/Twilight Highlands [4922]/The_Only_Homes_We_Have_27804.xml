  <Title>The Only Homes We Have</Title>
  <Description>We've already been pushed back farther than I'd hoped, but I'm not about to give up our homes to these mongrels. They may burn them, pillage them, and spit on the rubbled remains, but we'll still fight to take them back.$B$BThat being said, I rather like them not burnt. I have the boys running buckets from the well to try to keep the fire down. If you'd join them, they can help out by tossing you buckets so you don't have to make the runs.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Extinguish 50 fires at Firebeard's Patrol.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>As long as we work together, we can overcome anything the Twilight's Hammer might throw at us.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thanks for your help. Every little bit makes a difference.$B$BWe'll keep the water going until we can push the Twilight back.</RewardText>
