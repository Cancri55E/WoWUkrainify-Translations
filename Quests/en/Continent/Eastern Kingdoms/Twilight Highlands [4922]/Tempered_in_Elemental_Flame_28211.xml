  <Title>Tempered in Elemental Flame</Title>
  <Description>First things first: We're going to need ammunition. Ammunition powerful enough to pierce the armored hide of a black drake. $B$BWest of Thundermar is a Wildhammer town that's been overrun with unbound fire elementals. Any weapons left behind in that conflagration will have been tempered in elemental flame. Tougher than anything I could whip up at this forge!$B$BFind me spears in the Humboldt Conflagration, $n. The pointier the better.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 Tempered Spears.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Spears, yes? My rapid-fire speargun would be rendered ineffective without them.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Look at that - OW! Pointy! Hot!$B$BThese spears should cut through that dragonhide like an electric cheese-slicing apparatus through butter.</RewardText>
