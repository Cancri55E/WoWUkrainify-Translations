  <Title>Honorable Bearing</Title>
  <Description>Iain, my second in command, bore the body of one of our fallen heroes to the cathedral to the west. He's the man I've put in charge of reforming a wing of gryphon riders from whatever scattered forces he can find. I would like you to help him.$B$BI should impress upon you the urgency of this task. We will not be able to hold here forever; the Twilight's Hammer or the Dragonmaw orcs will eventually overwhelm us. Putting together an active gryphon wing may be our only hope for surviving these conflicts.</Description>
