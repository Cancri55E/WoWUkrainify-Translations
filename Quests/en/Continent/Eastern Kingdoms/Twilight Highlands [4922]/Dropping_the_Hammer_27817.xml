  <Title>Dropping the Hammer</Title>
  <Description>Thanks to you and Iain, we've got enough riders together that we can take the fight back to the Twilight.$B$BWe're trained to fight while ridin', but a second rider to handle the Stormhammer tends to be more efficient. I thought you might enjoy the honor.$B$BPick your gryphon and join the fight. Best be quick about it though - we're aimin' to clear every last one of those Twilight off of those floatin' rocks before the hour's out.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 12 Twilight Stormbenders and Servias Windterror using one of the gryphons at Firebeard's Patrol.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Today is the day that the tables turn.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Now that's how it's done, $g lad:lass;!$B$BWith a real gryphon wing back together, we can take the fight to the rest of the Twilight. You're welcome to fly with us anytime.</RewardText>
