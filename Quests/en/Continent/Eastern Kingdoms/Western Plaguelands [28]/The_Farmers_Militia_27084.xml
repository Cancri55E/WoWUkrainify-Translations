  <Title>The Farmers' Militia</Title>
  <Description>The battle started when they attacked us from the rear.  I let my guard down, and a group of poorly-armed farmers and militiamen swung into our flank from the Writhing Haunt.$b$bThey may be weak, but unchecked, they threaten to overwhelm us with their numbers.$b$bLindsay's pet abominations can handle the melee combat.  You take this collar, stay in the rear, and use it to release my ebon gargoyle upon these farmers.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Ebon Gargoyle Collar on 6 Provincial Militiamen within Andorhal.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Deal with these farmers now, $c.  That is your primary objective.  Teach them how truly unprepared they were for the horrors of war.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Merely a dent in their numbers... but the sight of their fellow men falling from the skies surely weakened their resolve.</RewardText>
