  <Title>Latent Disease</Title>
  <Description>I need plagued grass for an... an experiment, of sorts.  Those Argent Crusaders and those infernal Cenarion druids have done too good a job of healing the plaguelands, however... and I can't find proper reagents within a reasonable walking distance.$b$bSome of the local wildlife retain the plague's touch, however.  Kill a diseased black bear, then retrieve the grass that grows where its decaying body lies.  It's not optimal, but it'll do.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Diseased Black Bears in Western Plaguelands, then loot 20 Plague Tangles that grow near their corpses.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Animal tissue holds onto disease so much better than plant tissue, doesn't it?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Glorious!  This is the last bit I need.$b$bActually, stick around, $n.  Let me tell you a little bit more about our plan.</RewardText>
