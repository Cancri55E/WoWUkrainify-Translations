  <Title>The Menders' Stead</Title>
  <Description>I can handle training from here.  If you're looking for something else to do, I recommend heading up the road to the northwest.  The Cenarion druids and Argent Crusade have a small camp set up there, at Dalson's old farm.  Maybe they can keep you busy until we need your help again.</Description>
