  <Title>I Ain't Sayin' You a Gourd-Digger...</Title>
  <Description>$R!  I'm glad someone's here to help me out.$b$bWe Cenarion druids have re-cultivated Dalson's Farm, immediately behind me.  The land has flourished and our crops have been successful... mostly.$b$bA few plants seem to still be infected by the plague that ran through this land.  Perhaps their roots were too deep, perhaps the seeds were weak... I cannot say.  All I can say is that I need an able $c like you to help me remove the bad plants from the good ones.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Remove 6 Bad Corn, 4 Rotten Apples, and 3 Unhealthy-Looking Pumpkins from Dalson's Farm in Western Plaguelands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you finished killing... er, removing those plants yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for your help, $n.  I know that picking vegetables isn't the most heroic task imaginable, but even the humblest tasks have their rewards.</RewardText>
