  <Title>The Reckoning</Title>
  <Description>Your performance was admirable, soldier.  You make the Forsaken proud, which is more than I can say for our general, Koltira Deathweaver.$b$bI intend to have a word with that death knight.  He has shamed himself and his cause.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Stand by as Lady Sylvanas Windrunner speaks with Koltira Deathweaver.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I have nothing against the Knights of the Ebon Blade, but Koltira needs to be reminded who he works for now.  His loyalty must lie with the Horde.$b$bOr, more specifically, the Forsaken.$b$bI wouldn't plan on seeing Koltira anytime soon.  Now that I have him... you can rest assured that any bonds he may have had with that Alliance scum will be thoroughly broken.</RewardText>
