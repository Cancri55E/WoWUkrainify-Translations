  <Title>Too Close for Comfort</Title>
  <Description>I'm happy for Nathaniel: he's spent so long trying to return to Northridge, and now with the Scarlet Crusade out of the way, he can finally move back home.  It's just... even for such a seemingly-idyllic setting, it's not really the best place to raise a family.$b$bFor example: along this valley's edge, you will find rabid foxes searching for innocent prey.  Every once in a while I catch a glimpse of one looking right at me.$b$bPlease, $c, remove some of these foxes.  I don't feel safe with them near.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 12 Rabid Foxes near Northridge Lumber Mill in Western Plaguelands.</LogDescription>
