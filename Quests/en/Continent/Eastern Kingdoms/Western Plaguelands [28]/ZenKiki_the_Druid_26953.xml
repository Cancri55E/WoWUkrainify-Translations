You can thank us for healing this land, where once there was only death.$b$bWe accept all who choose to follow the druidic path, regardless of race, faction, or talent.  Occasionally that means we enlist a druid who needs more help than others.$b$bI'd like you to meet Zen'Kiki.  He's pretty new, and he's still learning his craft.  Would you mind taking him out with you for a while?  You can practice combat on the plagued animals that roam nearby.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 20 plagued wildlife with Zen'Kiki by your side.  You may kill Hulking Plaguebears, Diseased Wolves, Venom Mist Lurkers, or Plague Lurkers.$b$bReturn to the Menders' Stead if you become separated from Zen'Kiki.</LogDescription>
