  <Title>The Menders' Stead</Title>
  <Description>I don't like the looks of what the Forsaken are doing here at the Bulwark.  Bombs, cauldrons, needless bloodshed... none of these embody that which the Argent Crusade stands for.  Furthermore, I don't like the fact that they employ mercenaries like yourself.$b$bNothing against you personally, $c.  It's just that you could be doing so much more for yourself.  If you're interested in healing the plaguelands, rather than re-plaguing them, then report to Field Agent Kaartish at the Menders' Stead to the east.</Description>
