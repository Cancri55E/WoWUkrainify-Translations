The bottom level of the crypt was once used for storage of weapons and armor... until the Scourge came.  Now that the undead have left, the weapons are free for the taking.$b$bMost of the weapons are probably rusted and rotten by now, but they will serve better than tunics and pitchforks.</Description>
