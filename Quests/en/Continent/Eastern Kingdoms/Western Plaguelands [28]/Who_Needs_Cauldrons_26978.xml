  <Title>Who Needs Cauldrons?</Title>
  <Description>Have you seen the condition of Felstone Field?  The Alliance forces at Andorhal have taken the area, and they're using it to... to... to grow CROPS!$b$bI almost liked it better when the Scourge held the area.  At least they had the sense to put a giant plague cauldron in the middle of the field.$b$bWe're going to take that farm back from these humans, $n.  Take these drums and place them at key locations around the field.  I'll be waiting here at the Bulwark.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place Dithers' Plague Drums near the Windmill, the Grain Silos, the Ranch House, and the Barn at Felstone Field.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I see you're still carrying some of those drums with you, $n.  Don't return until they've all been placed.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Dithers practically glimmers with excitement.&gt;$b$bThe drums are placed?  In their positions?$b$bVery well then, I will give the word to the High Executor.  When the time is ready, he will be the one to press the ignition switch.</RewardText>
