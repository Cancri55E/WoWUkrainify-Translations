  <Title>Zen'Kiki and the Cultists</Title>
  <Description>While you've been away, I've been trying a different approach on our friend Zen'Kiki.  I believe he may have a future as a healer.  This is mainly because healing spells never miss.$b$bI hear from Field Agent Kaartish that the cultist camp to the east is where the plagued animals are coming from.  I hope you don't mind escorting Zen'Kiki over there... perhaps he can help heal some of the plagued animals within the camp.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Zen'Kiki to the Malicia Outpost in Western Plaguelands, then break 4 Captive Plaguebears out of their cages and allow Zen'Kiki to heal them.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>By the grace of the Earthmother, I hope this works.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>By the grace of the Earthmother, he's done it!  Thank you, $n!$b$bI admit, I had nearly given up hope on Zen'Kiki.  It is only due to your patience and diligence that he has come into his own as a druid and member of the Cenarion Circle.  And that's without even mentioning the good you've done for nature.$b$bYou have my admiration and respect.</RewardText>
