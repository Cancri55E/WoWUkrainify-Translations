  <Title>Gahrron's Withering Cauldron</Title>
  <Description>My analysis is complete!  The blight that affects the animals here is no residual disease.  No, it is something new... and I think I know what it is.$b$bThe Cult of the Damned maintains a plague cauldron on a farm called Gahrron's Withering.$B$BThis farm is due southeast of us, close to where the Eastern Plaguelands begin.  I need a sample from this cauldron to verify my suspicions.$b$bEliminate the cauldron lord present there for its key.  You will then be able to access the cauldron and obtain my sample.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>Get the key from the cauldron lord, then activate the cauldron.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Go to Gahrron's Withering in Western Plaguelands to locate and defeat the Cauldron Lord present there, and use its key to gain access to the cauldron.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>An access panel to the cauldron remains securely fastened.  In order to open it, you will need to find the key.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Cauldron Lord Soulwrath's key disintegrates as it touches the lock on the access panel at the base of the cauldron's platform.  A slight clanking noise is heard within, and the access panel swings open to reveal more viscous toxins within the cauldron's framework.$B$BThere is a small spigot that the bottle fits well enough under, allowing you to draw a sample for Field Agent Kaartish back at the Menders' Stead.</RewardText>
