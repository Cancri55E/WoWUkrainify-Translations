I've received orders from higher up that you are going to be helping out in this process.$b$bYou may have met Lindsay Ravensun on the battlefield in Andorhal.  I've never met her before, but she seems to have made some friends in high places, because she's taking over operations at Felstone.  You're to meet her at the charred Scarlet camp... the one you scouted out earlier.</Description>
