  <Title>Bagging Bisp</Title>
  <Description>Magus Bisp is one of Hearthglen's most preeminent arcanists.  To imagine that he would be interacting with gnolls... and dabbling in necromancy?  Unthinkable.$b$bYou'll find him atop the tower near Hearthglen's main gate.  Hopefully he'll have an explanation for all of this.  If not, well... I wouldn't go to the top of that tower unprepared, $n.</Description>

  <PortraitTurnInText>Bisp, gnolls and necromancy... oh my.</PortraitTurnInText>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Magus Bisp atop the mage tower in Hearthglen.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I suppose that we can take his aggression as an admission of guilt.  You alright, $n?</RewardText>
