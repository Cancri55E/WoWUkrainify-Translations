  <Title>Val'kyr Incursion</Title>

To think that Sylvanas is stooping to such levels for the sake of the Forsaken...$b$bWe need to stop the val'kyr before they wipe us out and turn our army against us.  Slay as many as you can find.  And bring some of these minutemen with you.  If they've survived this long, then they must have some battle skill.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 9 Lesser Val'kyr within Andorhal.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>For every val'kyr you slay, you save dozens of our men... and prevent the Forsaken forces from growing.$b$bStill, they press on.  We may not win this battle after all.</RewardText>
