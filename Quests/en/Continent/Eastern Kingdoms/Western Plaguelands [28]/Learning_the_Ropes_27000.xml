  <Title>Learning the Ropes</Title>
  <Description>Ah, it's good to be back in Northridge!  I've got my mill, my beautiful wife, a bouncing baby boy... I've even put in my hat with the Argent Crusade.  We'll be supplying Tirion's forces with lumber.$b$bMy lumberjacks were being exceptionally productive, too... up until the point when the spiders came.  Now they refuse to go any deeper in the woods.$b$bMaybe you can help me out.  Hop on one of my horses and use it to frighten those spiders.  Maybe we can avoid bloodshed and just scare them away.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Mount a Hearthglen Mustang at Northridge Lumber Mill, then use its Whinny ability to frighten 25 Northridge Spiders.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The spiders tend to be a little skittish.  One of the mustangs should be enough to scare them away.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, it sounds like they're certainly afraid of the mustang, but they're not leaving for good.  I can't have you running around on a horse forever.  Nor do I think you'd want to.$b$bFine.  Bloodshed it is.</RewardText>
