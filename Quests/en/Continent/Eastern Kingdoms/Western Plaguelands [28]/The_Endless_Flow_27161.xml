  <Title>The Endless Flow</Title>
  <Description>Araj the Summoner is bolstering the Scourge defenses with simple skeletons... an army of weaklings that will overwhelm you before it overpowers you.  He has assembled animi within Andorhal's northern towers that spew these skeletons out at an alarming rate.  But I've got the solution!$b$b&lt;Lang passes you a handful of grenades.&gt;$b$bTheir function is simple.  Throwing these grenades at a bone animus... or, for that matter, a mob of skeletons... will reduce them to splinters.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Lang's Hand Grenades to kill 5 Stickbone Berserkers and to destroy a Scourge Bone Animus.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>These grenades are all explosives, nothing more.  I may not be a goblin engineer... but I still understand the value of being able to just explode things every once in a while.</RewardText>
