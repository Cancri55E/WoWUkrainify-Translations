  <Description>Well, what do you know, $n?  All this time and Stormglen's been left mostly intact.$B$BIt's too bad the Forsaken are still working their way inland, but it'll make a fine place to rest our feet for a night or two.$B$BThe other half of town is overrun with spiders, so I've asked the villagers to stay away from there.$B$BPerhaps you'd like to lend a hand in clearing the spiders out?  I'm certain our injured men and women will sleep more soundly if they know someone's keeping those eight-legged beasts at bay.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 6 Vilebrood Skitterers in Stormglen.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You've done well, $n.  The spiders are everywhere, however, and I'm afraid we've barely put a dent in their numbers.</RewardText>
