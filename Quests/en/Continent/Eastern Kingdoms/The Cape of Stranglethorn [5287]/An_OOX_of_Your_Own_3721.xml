  <Title>An OOX of Your Own</Title>
  <Description />
  <RewardText>You've recovered three of my OOX homing robots!  You've gone above and beyond what you needed to, so I will give you something special for all your help.  It is a miniature version of the very same robot that you have come to know and love, the OOX!$B$BI normally wouldn't let anyone have such a potentially lethal device, but you've been a real help.  Besides - the combat mechanisms and the homing logic on this one have been disabled.$B$BOther than that, it's an OOX by golly!</RewardText>
