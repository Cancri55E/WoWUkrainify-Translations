  <Title>Ol' Blasty</Title>
  <Description>We've got some work to do.  How much experience have you got with cannons?  Hmm... really?  Well, how about with ancient, fallin'-apart pirate cannons?$b$bWe've got a few cannons updecks that work the old-fashioned way: you load one cannonball in at a time, aim, lock it into place, and fire.  Works well if you're tryin' to hit the side of a three-sailer... not so well for rowboats and the like.$b$bWhy don't you head upstairs and lob a few shots at Smilin' Timmy Sticks?</Description>
