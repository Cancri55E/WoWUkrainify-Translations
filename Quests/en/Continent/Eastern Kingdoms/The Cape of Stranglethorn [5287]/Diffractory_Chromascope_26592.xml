  <Title>Diffractory Chromascope</Title>
  <Description>To properly identify this artifact, I will need tools for analysis.  A diffractory chromascope should suffice, I think.$b$bI already have the mithril casing, which surprisingly, is the hardest part to find.  We simply need two other pieces: a ruby and a sapphire.$b$bThere's pirates nearby, just to our south, and a bit farther to the east.  Pirates love treasure... why don't you see if you can find some gems for me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain a Bloodsail Ruby and a Bloodsail Sapphire.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Flem's eyes sparkle.&gt;$b$bAre those gems I see?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Flem weighs the gems in his hands and nods in approval.&gt;$b$bYes, these will do.  Now to perform the analysis...$b$b&lt;The goblin clacks the gems together for a while, then looks up at you.&gt;$b$bOh, you're still here?  You don't think I'm a fraud or something, do you?</RewardText>
