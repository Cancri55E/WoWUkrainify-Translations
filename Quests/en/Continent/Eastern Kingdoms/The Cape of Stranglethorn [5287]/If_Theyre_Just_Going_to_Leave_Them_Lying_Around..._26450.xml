  <Title>If They're Just Going to Leave Them Lying Around...</Title>
  <Description>I was just thinking about something, $n.  Those naga have more than just reeds down there.  They tend to keep little statues lying around on their shrines, in the sand, under their trees.  They don't seem to be USING them.$b$bI could use those statues!  I could... put 'em around the camp, make it feel a little more homey.  Anything's better than a bloody dinosaur corpsepump.  I could sell them as souvenirs.$b$bI could sell them back to the naga!$b$bWhy don't you go grab a couple while I figure this out.</Description>
