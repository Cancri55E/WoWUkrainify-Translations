Horde vs. Alliance, Alliance vs. Alliance, Horde vs. Horde... anything goes.$b$bTake this battle standard, $r, and place it down on the arena floor.  Defeat the summoned combatant, then return to me.$b$bStay on your toes, $r.  Anything goes inside the Gurubashi Arena.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place the Gurubashi Challenge Flag down inside the Battle Ring, then defeat the Gurubashi Arena Challenger.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Well done, $r!  Did you feel it?  The rush of the melee?  The true risk of free-for-all combat?$b$bAs today is your first day here, I'll let you perform in one more competition for another reward.  If you return in the future, you may compete again, once a day.  Your rewards will, of course, improve as you become stronger.</RewardText>
