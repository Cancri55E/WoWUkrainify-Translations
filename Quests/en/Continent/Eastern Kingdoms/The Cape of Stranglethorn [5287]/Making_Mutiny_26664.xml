  <Title>Making Mutiny</Title>
  <Description>Before returning to Booty Bay, you should do everything you can to weaken the Bloodsail Buccaneers.  Unfortunately, even as captain, you're prohibited from killing other buccaneers in cold blood.  Only a Fleet Master can do that.$b$bYou can, however, put mutineers to the sword... and mutiny can be awfully hard to disprove.$b$bSpeaking of which, those Bloodsail corsairs that hang out on the lowest level of the ships have been acting awfully suspicious...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Accuse 9 Bloodsail Corsairs of mutiny, then kill them.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You haven't much time before you have to return to Booty Bay!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The fewer Bloodsail Buccaneers that Booty Bay has to fight, the better.  However, it might be best to stop slaughtering your supposed allies before you draw suspicion to yourself.</RewardText>
