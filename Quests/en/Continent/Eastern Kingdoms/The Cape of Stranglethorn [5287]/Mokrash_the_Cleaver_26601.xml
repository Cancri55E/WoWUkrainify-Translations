  <Title>Mok'rash the Cleaver</Title>
  <Description>Mok'rash the Cleaver is the last of the lot.  And the largest, by my memory.  Taller than a wave in a windstorm, with a beard like a kelp forest and a hammer like an oak tree.$b$bHe taunts me from Janeiro's Point, the island right off the end of this very pier.  It's because of him that I'm still trapped here, living this lamentable landlubber's life.$b$bIf you can swim, then head out to Janeiro's Point and slay Mok'rash.$b$bTake care, $n.  Mok'rash will not lay down as easily as his brothers.</Description>
