My cousin up north sent me this weird artifact, and I need your help to... ah... identify it.$b$bTo start out, I'm going to need you to obtain The Holy Water of Clarity.  Rumor has it that whoever drinks from this spring is given a vision of clarity.$b$bSounds pretty promising, doesn't it?$b$bObtain it from the Nek'mani Wellspring at the peak of the naga camp.  Good luck!</Description>
