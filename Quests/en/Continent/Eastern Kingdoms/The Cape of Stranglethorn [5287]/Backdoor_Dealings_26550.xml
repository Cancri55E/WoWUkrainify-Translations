  <Title>Backdoor Dealings</Title>
  <Description>Zanzil the Outcast, an exile from the Gurubashi tribe, is my quarry.  Recently, I have heard tales from my brothers in the north about his planned reentry into society, starting with the emissary he sent to the Skullsplitters.  This is not good news.$b$bI want you to peer into Zanzil's current plans.  Take this incense, and place it in front of the bat totem in the Ruins of Jubuwal, to the east.  Hir'eek will guide you from there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place the Gurubashi Incense in front of the Totem of Hir'eek, then listen to Zanzil's plot.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You have not done as I asked, $r.  Perhaps I was wrong to have selected you for this task...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It is as I suspected.  Zanzil is too haughty to interfere with the squabbles between the Bloodscalps and the Skullsplitters.  No, he is playing a part in a grander scheme... Jin'do the Hexxer is using him to help bring Hakkar back to Zul'Gurub.$b$bIt's good that we found this out now, because it offers us a simple solution.</RewardText>
