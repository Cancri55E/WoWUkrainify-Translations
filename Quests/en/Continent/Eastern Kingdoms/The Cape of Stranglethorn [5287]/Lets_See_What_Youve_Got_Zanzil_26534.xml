  <Title>Let's See What You've Got, Zanzil</Title>
  <Description>Visitors to Hardwrench Hideaway sign a number of waivers upon arrival, one of which allows us to perform basic tests on them.  I'd say it's about time we invoked that clause again.$b$bActually, let's avoid poisoning our customers this time.  Better for business.$b$b&lt;Jasper fills a pitcher with Zanzil's Mixture and some crushed ice.&gt;$b$bThe Hideaway's southeastern tower serves as a temporary jail.  "Hardwrench Hoosegow," we call it.  Anyways, give the prisoners a drink and tell me what happens.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Offer Jasper's Jungle Cooler to Gmurgl, Orgus, and Captain Bartholomew Softbeard.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Come back when that pitcher's empty, $n.</CompletionText>
