  <Title>Looks Like a Tauren Pirate to Me</Title>
  <Description>Firallon wants MY head?  Now that's interesting.  But it's nothing we can't work around.$b$bThis Yancey character probably doesn't know my face too well.  Most non-tauren find us tauren indistinguishable from one another.  In fact... most non-tauren find us indistinguishable from... a certain four-legged farm creature.$b$bRikqiz the leatherworker keeps one of these creatures here in Booty Bay, and Narkk is my chief supplier for pirate hats.  Get a replacement head and a hat, then return with both.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Obtain a Cow Head and an Oversized Pirate Hat, then bring them back to Fleet Master Seahorn.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You should know that most tauren would find this shameful.  I find it... amusing.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That should fool that Bloodsail dimwit.$b$bThis was fun, $n.</RewardText>
