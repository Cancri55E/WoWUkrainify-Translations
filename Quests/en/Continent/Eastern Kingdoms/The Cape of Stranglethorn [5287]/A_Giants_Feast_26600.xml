  <Title>A Giant's Feast</Title>
  <Description>The next giant on my list is called Negolash.  I remember vividly how he leapt from the seafoam and plucked poor Poop-Deck Paul from the crow's nest.$b$bSwallowed him in one gulp, he did.  And snapped my mizzenmast in two on the way down.$b$bNo man on my crew deserves such a heinous death.  So we're going to use Negolash's appetite against him.  Kelsey Yance should be able to sell you some meat, and Whiskey Slim has enough booze to knock out... well, a sea giant.  You'll find both of them in town.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Purchase a Crate of Grade-E Meat from Kelsey Yance and a Crate of Pupellyverbos Port from Whiskey Slim.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We're going to need a lot of food, $n.  Quantity over quality is the goal here.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This wasn't expensive, was it?  Well, here's some pieces of eight to reimburse you.$b$bNow let's get onto this revenge, shall we?</RewardText>
