  <Title>Zanzil's Secret</Title>
  <Description>Years ago, the Gurubashi exiled one of their own from Zul'Gurub: a troll by the name of Zanzil.  The reasons why aren't all that clear, but I'd guess it had something to do with his tendency to administer powerful, behavior-altering drugs to anyone he saw.  Anyhow, the Gurubashi priests and their blood god have been slain, but Zanzil the Outcast remains...$b$b...as do his powerful, behavior-altering drugs.$b$bI need his mixture for my next test.  Check the zombies to the north.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 5 vials of Zanzil's Mixture.</LogDescription>
