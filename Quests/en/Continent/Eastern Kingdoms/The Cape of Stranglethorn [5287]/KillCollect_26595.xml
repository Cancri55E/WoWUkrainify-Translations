  <Title>Kill-Collect</Title>
  <Description>There's three phases to debt collecting: asking nicely, asking forcefully, and something I like to call "Phase Three".$b$bUnfortunately, collecting during Phase Three is something that this old dog can't do any more.  That's why I employ so many cronies, stooges, mooks, goons, and noble adventurers like yourself!$b$bJuntz Fitztittle, Ephram Moonfall, and Maury Wilkins are hiding out on the eastern coast.  You should have no problem visiting them all in one trip... and bringing back their valuables.  </Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain Maury's Clubbed Foot, Fitztittle's Ratcheting Torque Wrench, and Ephram's Jeweled Mirror.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>$n, did you find those debtors?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Great!  I can get a good price for these, especially for what's inside Maury's foot!  Thanks much, $n!$B$BI hope those three learned their lesson: don't bet something you can't afford to lose.$B$BAnd maybe it's too late for them, but...they should be careful of who they gamble with.</RewardText>
