  <Title>Up to Snuff</Title>
  <Description>Ah, the sea life.  I ain't gonna say it's the good life, but it's my life.$b$bWhen I get into port I like to find me a good bottle of grog and some high quality snuff.  Nasty habits but what's a pirate without his vices, right?$b$bSo you can imagine how heartbroken I was to find out the herbalist here in town has gone and sold out of the stuff.  Says his shipment got hijacked by those damned Bloodsail Raiders.$b$bI bet a fearless $c like you could convince 'em to share the goods, eh?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deeg in Booty Bay wants you to bring him 15 tiny heaps of Snuff.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Any luck finding the goods, matey?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good show, $n!  And just before I need to ship out too!  Can't thank you enough, old friend.</RewardText>
