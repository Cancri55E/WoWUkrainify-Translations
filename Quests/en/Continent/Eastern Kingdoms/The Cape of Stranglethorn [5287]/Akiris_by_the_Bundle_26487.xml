  <Title>Akiris by the Bundle</Title>
  <Description>It's not easy running a combination 5-star exotic resort/jungle resource salvaging plant!  That is, it wouldn't be easy, if I didn't have the organizational skills of a trade prince's personal assistant!$b$bThe first trick is multitasking.  For example: the naga explorers to our south carry a valuable ocean reed - Akiris reeds.  We can sell these reeds to our clients overseas, and we can also stuff our visitors' mattresses with them!  Come to think of it, we could probably use some more of that stuff.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 6 Akiris Reeds from Naga Explorers.</LogDescription>
