  <LogDescription>Deal with Zanzil the Outcast and High Priest Venoxis.$b$bIf you become lost or need to return to Zul'Gurub, speak with Maywiki at the Explorers' League Digsite.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I ask you to slay Zanzil the Outcast, a lowly, hermetic exile of the Gurubashi, and what do you do?  You dash headfirst into the Gurubashi capital and eliminate one of their High Priests!  Very nearly two!  Only one word suffices to explain such a rash and foolhardy endeavor:$b$bHeroism.$b$bJin'do the Hexxer still walks within Zul'Gurub's walls, but he lost one of his legs when you crushed Jeklik.  Today's battle is ours.</RewardText>
