Good luck!</Description>

  <RewardText>&lt;The goblin downs the water in one gulp.&gt;$b$bAhh... do you know how hard it is to get fresh water in Stranglethorn?  It's no wonder that the nagas guard their shrine so ferociously!$b$bOh, right... your artifact, and clarity.  Clarity...$b$bI've got it!</RewardText>
