  <Title>Just Like Old Times</Title>
  <Description>It's funny. Kin and I have been through so much together, and here we find ourselves back in Arathi, like so many years ago.$B$BWe broke up a plot to create a new plague right here, her and I. It doesn't look like the Horde learned their lesson, because they're all over this farm yet again.$B$BTheir undead courier is shuffling around as obvious as daylight. If you want to help, find the courier and bring back whatever they're carrying.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>Find her on the road.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Collect the Sealed Folder from the Forsaken Courier.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We appreciate your help in looking for that courier, $n.$B$BWhile you were gone, Kin saw an apothecary come out of that same house to the south of here. I'm confident that they're up to no good--I just need proof of it before we go off and do something rash.$B$BHave you had any luck yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Apothecaries yet again. You think they'd get the message. Let's see what it is this time...</RewardText>
