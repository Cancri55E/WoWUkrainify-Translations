  <Title>Call to Arms</Title>
  <Description>Our next strike against the ogres will bring you further east to Stromgarde. The living consider these gutted ruins worth clinging to. Their sentimentality is disgusting!$B$BAll that Stromgarde holds for us is a foul den of more ogres, waiting to be struck down. Travel there and slay their shamans and lords, and ensure what passes for leadership among the ogres is snuffed out.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 7 Boulderfist Shaman and 3 Boulderfist Lords in Stromgarde.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The ogres lurk in the corner of the ruins, away from the humans. Don't forget I'm only rewarding you for slaughtering ogres this time, $c. You can do what you want for fun, but don't expect extra credit.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Cleared out properly? Good. I doubt we'll even bother to lurk in Stromgarde. That ramshackle hole needs to be razed into dust.$B$BThe land would make a decent spot for a new Undercity in its place.</RewardText>
