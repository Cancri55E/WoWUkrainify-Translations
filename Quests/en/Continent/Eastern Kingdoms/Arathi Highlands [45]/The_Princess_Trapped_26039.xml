  <Title>The Princess Trapped</Title>
  <Description>My name is Myzrael.  I am a princess of the earth, and my captors, the giants, have trapped me deep beneath the Arathi Highlands.  These crystal shards are the only way I can speak with the surface world.$B$BPlease help me.  Allies of the giants, the Drywhisker kobolds, have a shard like this one in their Drywhisker Gorge, to the east.  To power the cluster, you must gather motes of Myzrael from the kobolds and apply them to it.$B$BI beg you, $n, aid me!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 12 Motes of Myzrael from Drywhisker Kobolds.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>This cluster of shards looks much like the Shards of Myzrael.  But the same feeling of security does not pulse through them.</CompletionText>
