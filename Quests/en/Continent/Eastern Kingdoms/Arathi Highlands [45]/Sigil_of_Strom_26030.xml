  <Title>Sigil of Strom</Title>
  <Description>In ancient times, Lord Ignaeus of Strom, named Trollbane, led the first human civilization of Arathor in war against the trolls. His blade was Trol'kalar--troll slayer, in their ancient tongue.$B$BI was one of the last of his line, sworn with guarding Trol'kalar...a duty in which I failed. But now, we will obtain it once more, for my new master.$B$BThe sword is bound by three sigils. The first is held by the Syndicate traitors that lurk the ruins of Stromgarde. Slay them, and return the sigil to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect the Sigil of Strom from Syndicate members in Stromgarde Keep.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Only the Syndicate agents in Stromgarde will have the sigil. Spilling blood outside the fortress's walls will be a waste of your time.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I hated the Syndicate in life as much as I do in death. To see the sigil again is a small comfort.$B$BBut we have much more work to do... for Sylvanas.</RewardText>
