  <Description>Hey, $n. Sorry to be so short with ye earlier... and no, that ain't a pun.$B$BI figured out where Trelane's first item ended up: Kor'gresh has it in Boulderfist Hall. An' by the way he was throwing down blasts of ice at his kin to keep them in line, he must be close to figurin' out how to use all of its powers.$B$BBoulderfist Hall's south of here an' then east of Thandol Span. Find the ogre an' get back that wand.$B$BWhile you're gone, I'll figure out what we're gonna do about Stromgarde.</Description>

The other three items are all in Stromgarde.$B$BTake a rest an' get your strength back--the next phase of my plan'll require a little more time an' effort.
