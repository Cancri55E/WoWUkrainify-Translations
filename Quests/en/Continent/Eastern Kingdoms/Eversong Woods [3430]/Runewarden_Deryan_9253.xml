  <Title>Runewarden Deryan</Title>
  <Description>This increase in Scourge attacks leads me to believe there might be a malfunction at one of the protective runestones at the border with the Ghostlands.$B$BWe used these ancient stones to protect us against the undead.  Most of them were destroyed or lost after the attack on the Sunwell. $B$BFollow the road south, towards the Ghostlands, and look to the west for a small path.  You will find Runewarden Deryan by the runestone nearby; he will know whether anything's wrong.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Runewarden Deryan in Eversong Woods, near the border with the Ghostlands.</LogDescription>
