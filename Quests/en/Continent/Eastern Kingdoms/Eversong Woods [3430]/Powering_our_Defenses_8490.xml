  <Title>Powering our Defenses</Title>
  <Description>Ancient runestones once powered a protective barrier across the Eversong border.  Many were destroyed during Arthas' attack; others were stolen.$B$BOf the three that remain, only this one has retained its powers.  The runestone to the east might be salvageable, though.$B$BTake this crystal and instill its energy on the Eastern Runestone.  The process should take but a minute.  Beware though, nearby Scourge will be drawn to it and will seek to destroy it.  Do not let them! </Description>
  <LogDescription>Place the Infused Crystal at the Eastern Runestone and protect it from the Scourge for 1 minute.  Return the Infused Crystal to Runewarden Deryan in Eversong Woods for a reward.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you succeeded in powering the runestone yet, $N?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent.  The defenses should hold off the Scourge a bit longer.  Thank you for lending us a hand, $N.</RewardText>
