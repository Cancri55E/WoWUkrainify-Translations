  <Title>Captain Kelisendra's Lost Rutters</Title>
  <Description>Interesting... what you have found here is a water-proofed, leather tube containing a number of sheets of parchment. By the markings upon them, the pages are clearly navigation rutters, and each bears the signature of one Captain Kelisendra.$B$BYou've heard of a small, defended camp just east of the nearby Sunsail Anchorage. Maybe the captain is there?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return Captain Kelisendra's Lost Rutters to Captain Kelisendra at the defended camp just to the east of the Sunsail Anchorage in Eversong Woods.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hello, $c, you're a sight for sore eyes. I know, it's crazy for me to be here, what with the anchorage overrun by the Wretched. Velendris and his rangers have sworn to protect me on the condition that I get out of here as soon as I've recovered my cargo.$B$BWhat's that you have there... it looks vaguely familiar?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Oh you sweet, sweet $c! I had no idea that those disgusting Grimscale murlocs had also pirated away with my navigation rutters! Without them, I would have no chance of navigating the seas again once we retake the anchorage and repair the ship.$B$BThank you very much! Here, take this coin as a sign of my appreciation.</RewardText>
