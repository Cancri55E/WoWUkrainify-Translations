  <Title>Word from the Spire</Title>
  <Description>$n, I have one last favor to ask of you. Would you please relay what's transpired here to Magister Duskwither, back at the Farstrider Retreat? Let him know that I am well, but make certain that he is aware that some of the apprentices have become Wretched.$B$BThank you for your help!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Magister Duskwither at the Farstrider Retreat in Eversong Woods.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>No! I was too late. It is all my fault.$B$BMy investigation into purifying alternative magical sources got out of hand before I could put a stop to it. If only I had gone myself... or that they had listened to me, and heeded my warnings!$B$BI have blood on my hands, $C. I thank you, though, for putting to rest the tortured souls of my former apprentices. It is some small consolation that they will not linger in that state where a Blood Elf is better off dead.</RewardText>
