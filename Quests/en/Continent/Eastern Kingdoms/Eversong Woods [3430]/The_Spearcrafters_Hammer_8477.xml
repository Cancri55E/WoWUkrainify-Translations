  <Title>The Spearcrafter's Hammer</Title>
  <Description>The Amani and the sin'dorei have a long history of mutual dislike and open hostility.  That doesn't prevent me from appreciating a fellow craftsman's work, $n.$B$BI've come across pieces of Amani weaponry and I must admit I'm impressed by the quality of their work.  It is rumored that Spearcrafter Otembe wields a magical hammer that is so light and well-balanced it allows him to work with great dexterity and efficiency.$B$BIf you bring me this tool I'll use it to craft you a weapon.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search Tor'Watha to the southeast of the Farstrider Retreat for Spearcrafter Otembe and bring Otembe's Hammer to Arathel Sunforge at the Farstrider Retreat in Eversong Woods.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You've brought me Otembe's hammer, $N?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There's truth to the rumors! This hammer is light and strong at once; I shall manage to complete several of my unfinished projects.  And of course, I'll let you have first pick. </RewardText>
