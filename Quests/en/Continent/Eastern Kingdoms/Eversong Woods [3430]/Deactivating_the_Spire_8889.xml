  <Title>Deactivating the Spire</Title>
  <Description>As you may know, Magister Duskwither sent me back here to shut down the power sources that feed the Spire. There are three of them, each located in a different place inside.$B$BUnfortunately, I appear to be too late, and Duskwither Spire has been overrun with strange, magical creatures. While I haven't the expertise to accomplish this task, surely a $c, such as yourself, could do so easily?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deactivate the 3 Duskwither Spire Power Sources inside Duskwither Spire. Then return the Deactivating Jewel to Apprentice Loralthalis in Eversong Woods.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I can't be certain from this distance... have you already shut down the power to Duskwither Spire?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I am grateful to you for your assistance, but saddened to hear that some of my fellow apprentices have fallen to their addiction.$B$BWith the power to the Spire cut off, I think I'll stay here a while and see if things calm down long enough for me to sneak in and retrieve their remains.</RewardText>
