  <Title>Pelt Collection</Title>
  <Description>The springpaw that inhabit this region are known for their high quality pelts.  We've even seen night elf scum travel to these lands just to poach them.$B$BOur skirmishes with the Amani have put a bit of a strain on our supply of gear and our rangers don't have much time to hunt for pelts anymore.  If you'd be willing to lend a hand by collecting springpaw pelts, I'd be happy to reward you with a hand-crafted piece of armor.  You'll find springpaw stalkers all around the woods north of here.</Description>

  <CompletionText>You're back.  Did you bring the pelts?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These will do perfectly, $N.  Take this piece of armor as a reward.  I'll be able to make more with the pelts you brought me.</RewardText>
