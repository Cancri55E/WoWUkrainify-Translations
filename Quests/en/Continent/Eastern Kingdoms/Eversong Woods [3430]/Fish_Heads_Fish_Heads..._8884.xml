  <Description>Greetings, $c.  Take a look toward the shore; what do you see?  That's right, our beach... our Tranquil Shore, has been infested with the malignancy known as the murloc.$B$BThis blight will not stand!$B$BI have a task for you.  If you feel that you're up to it, I would have their heads!  Let us see if we can put a dent in their numbers so large that, if they have any sense at all, they will return to the murky depths from which they sprang!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 Grimscale Murloc Heads.  Return them to Hathvelion Sungaze in the Eversong Woods on the bluff overlooking the Tranquil Shore.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We rangers of the Farstrider Retreat are dedicated to setting right the damage that has been wreaked upon our fair lands. We will go to any length to do so.$B$BI trust that you have returned with the murloc heads I tasked you to gather? </CompletionText>
  <RewardText>A job well done. by the smell of it, I'd say you returned all that I asked for, and possibly more. I'm sure we can find some use for these, in a stew, or somesuch.$B$BAlas, it does not appear that your efforts have done the trick; the murlocs are not in retreat. This calls for more direct action! </RewardText>
