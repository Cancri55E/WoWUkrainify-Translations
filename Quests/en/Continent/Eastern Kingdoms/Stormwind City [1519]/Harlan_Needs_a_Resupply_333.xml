  <Title>Harlan Needs a Resupply</Title>
  <Description>We've been doing a lot of business lately.  It seems like everyone is buying armor and sturdy clothes.  Almost like they expect a cold, harsh season ahead...$B$BBut those are future worries.  My worry today is that I'm running out of knitted clothing to sell.  I need another load from our supplier.$B$BIf you can take this request to Rema Schneider at the Canal Tailor and Fit Shop, I'd be most grateful.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Go to the Canal Tailor Shop and bring Rema Schneider the Cloth Request from Harlan Bagley.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You bring word from Mr. Bagley?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It says here that Harlan's business is booming.  That's good news, but I wonder why people have need of all that armor.  I've heard nothing of open war...is there something the nobles aren't telling us?$B$BWell, thank you for bringing the request.  Here's your payment, and I'll see to it that Harlan gets his supplies.</RewardText>
