  <Title>Missing Merchandise</Title>
  <Description>Hmmph, those sea-brained Seabraids are off on another adventure, and I'm stuck here sifting through their goods!

Ah, maybe I'm a bit bitter, but I do wish Tawny could be a bit more brief. I don't need a novel, just some instructions is all. And on top of it all some of the merchandise has disappeared, along with one of my workers! 

Would ye mind gettin' it back for me? I'm sure ye could tempt him with an exchange of a drink, or throw this at him if ye can't.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve the stolen goods from the thief at the Stormwind Harbor.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Throw the briny seawater at the thief to get the merchandise back.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah! Ye got  seawater on the merchandise! Ah well, I don't think the Seabraids will mind too much... long as it's intact.</RewardText>
