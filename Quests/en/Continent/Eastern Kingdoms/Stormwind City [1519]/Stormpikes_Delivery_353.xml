  <Title>Stormpike's Delivery</Title>
  <Description>The Stormpikes are a respected dwarven clan, and are well known for their fine and discerning tastes.  So it's no wonder that Gringer Stormpike, a Mountaineer of Ironforge, commissioned me to craft him a weapon.$B$BThe weapon is finished, but... Mountaineer Stormpike is far away, in distant Loch Modan.  If you plan on traveling to the north, can you deliver this package to him?$B$BMy last message from Mountaineer Stormpike said he's stationed at the northern guard tower in Loch Modan.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver the Package for Stormpike to Mountaineer Stormpike in Loch Modan.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You come all the way from Stormwind? I hear it's getting dicey down there in the human lands, with brigands and orcs running about. A perfect place for a $C to prove his worth!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Aha! So Grimand finally finished my axe! I can't wait to try it against some troggs and kobolds!$b$bMany thanks, $N. It was a long distance to travel for this delivery.  Here are some coins for your efforts.</RewardText>
