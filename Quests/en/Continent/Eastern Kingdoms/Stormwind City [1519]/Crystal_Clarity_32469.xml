  <Description>Hi again! Oh, I forgot to tell you! I've devised a foolproof way to improve your S.E.L.F.I.E. cam! 

In fact, with just the right gemstones, I can make a lens that would allow us to do all sorts of things!

She sounds pretty tough, though! You should bring some friends!</Description>
