  <Title>The Fallen Lion</Title>
  <Description>I haven't left the deck of this ship since we got back. The fleet must be made ready for war. Don't know where we will be needed, but when the call comes, we'll be ready.$b$bTruth be told... I welcome the distraction. The others are paying their respects to Varian, but I... I cannot bring myself to face that casket. To face his son.$b$bVarian gave me a letter he wrote to Anduin. Please, take it to him on my behalf.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver King Varian's letter to King Anduin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Welcome, $n. I am pleased you survived the battle. You have something for me?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Anduin sighs and reads the letter from his father. Tears well in his eyes. He is silent for several moments.&gt;$b$bThank you for bringing this to me, $n, it means... more than I can say. I wish Greymane felt he could present it himself, but his mind is fixed on revenge.$b$bI cannot blame him... or Jaina, for that matter, but we must find a better way.$b$bEnough of such talk. It is good you are here. We will need heroes like you in the many battles to come.</RewardText>
