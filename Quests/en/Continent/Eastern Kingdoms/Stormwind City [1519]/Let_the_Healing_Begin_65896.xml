  <Title>Let the Healing Begin</Title>
  <Description>Do you think you would be able to step into this city without me noticing? No!

I was right about your kind before and I'll be damned before I let dragons destroy my home again.

This once was a park filled with joy and peace. Then your progenitor, Deathwing, came. Oh yes, I know all about him. 

See for yourself the legacy of destruction that was left behind. The pain that walks these streets still.</Description>
