  <Title>Home Is Where the Hearth Is</Title>
  <Description>I don't know about you, but all this running around has got me thirsty!

Why don't we head over to the Pig and Whistle Tavern and rest our legs over some cool pints of moonberry juice?

While we're there, speak with Meagan the innkeeper to make the Pig and Whistle Tavern your new home. That way, if you ever find yourself stranded without a flight master nearby, you can use your hearthstone to return to the inn.

Not only is it faster than a gryphon, but you'll save a few copper in the process!</Description>
