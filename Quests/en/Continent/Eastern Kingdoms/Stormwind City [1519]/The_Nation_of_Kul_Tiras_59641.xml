  <Title>The Nation of Kul Tiras</Title>
  <Description>Kul Tiras is the greatest naval power on Azeroth, and a former member of the Alliance. But we've had little contact with them since Jaina's father, Lord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore, was killed at Theramore.

Many have said that Jaina believed so deeply in the promise of peace between the Alliance and Horde that she betrayed her own father on that day. Perhaps she feels it is time to put the past to rest.

Loathe as I am to put Jaina at risk... Kul Tiras must rejoin the Alliance.

Light be with you.</Description>
