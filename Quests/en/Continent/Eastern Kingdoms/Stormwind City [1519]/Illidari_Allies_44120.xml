  <Title>Illidari Allies</Title>
  <Description>At first I was unsure whether it was wise to allow the Illidari inside the city. But they may have just saved all our lives.$b$bI gave the demon hunters leave to establish a temporary camp in the Mage Quarter. I'd like you to be my personal envoy to them. Thank the Illidari for their assistance and see how they can aid our cause.$b$bJust... keep your eyes open. They have harnessed a terrible power, and we must be ready should they be consumed by the darkness within.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet with the Illidari representative in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I see by the blood spatters that Jace revealed the demons to you. I trust the young king is safe.$b$bWe have more work ahead of us, $c. Much more.</RewardText>
