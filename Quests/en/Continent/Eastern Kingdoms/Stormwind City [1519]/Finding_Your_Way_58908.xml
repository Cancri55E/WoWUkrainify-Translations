  <Title>Finding Your Way</Title>
  <Description>Stormwind has a lot to offer adventurers like us, but it's far too big to explore on foot. The captain has arranged for you to receive a mount to help you get around.

She said to speak with Curly at the stables in Old Town... but I can't seem to remember the way there.

Have no worries, $n! All we need to do is ask a guard for directions. If you ever need help finding something, the city guards will show you where to go.

Let's ask a nearby guard for directions to the stable master in Old Town!</Description>
