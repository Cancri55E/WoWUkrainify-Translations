  <Title>Return to Argus</Title>
  <Description>The gryphon master in Goldshire is Bartlett.  If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my gryphons to him.$B$BThat's a good lesson to know: gryphons are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote gryphon master after you've already been there.$B$BYou've already been to Bartlett, so just speak with me again when you're ready to take a gryphon to Goldshire.  Once there, you can deliver Osric's Crate to Smith Argus.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Buy a gryphon ride to Goldshire from the gryphon master Dungar Longdrink, then take Osric's Crate to Smith Argus at Goldshire.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You're back from Stormwind?  Did Osric send the armor?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Great, you brought the armor!  We'll get this divvied to those who need it immediately.$B$BThank you, $n.  Your efforts have been a great help to us.  And now that you're no stranger to gryphons, I hope you'll come and lend your aid to Goldshire often!</RewardText>
