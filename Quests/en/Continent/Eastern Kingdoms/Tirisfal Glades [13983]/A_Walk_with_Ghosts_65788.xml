  <Title>A Walk with Ghosts</Title>
  <Description>Reclaiming these ruins means a lot to the Forsaken. Especially since the war ended, our people have needed something to hold onto, to give us purpose in the wake of everything that's happened to us.

I saw Calia walk toward the throne room. That place holds many memories for her. Many ghosts. 

We should check on her.</Description>
