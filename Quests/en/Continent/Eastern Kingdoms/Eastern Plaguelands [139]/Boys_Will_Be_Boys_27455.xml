  <Description>As soon as we arrived here at Light's Shield Tower, those two lunkhead paladins ran off to Light's Hope Chapel.  It's still a ways away, but if we're going to follow Argus along his tour of the towers, this is about as close as we're going to get.$b$bCheck in on them and make sure they're alright?  I know they can handle themselves, but still, it'd make me feel better to know that you were watching over them while I'm stuck here with the caravan.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Gidwin Goldbraids at Light's Hope Chapel in Eastern Plaguelands.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I can't believe it.  We're literally FEET away from becoming sworn members of the Argent Crusade.$b$bWe'd be in there already if it weren't for Tarenar's dallying.  If he doesn't quit chatting with the locals soon, I'm going to head in there myself.</RewardText>
