  <Title>Victory From Within</Title>
  <Description>A few of our men didn't make it through portals which were supposed to open inside this very abbey.  You've already proven your elusiveness and battlehardiness... now I need you to do so again.$b$bThe abbey has two wings: a library, and a hall of arms.  In each wing, you should find a portal.$b$bUse this keystone on these portals.  Doing so should force them open, allowing our remaining shock troopers to take this abbey.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Open the Argent Portals in the Library Wing and the Hall of Arms within the abbey in Tyr's Hand.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>One hundred soldiers is few enough.  Setbacks like this only decrease our chances of success.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The abbey will fall shortly.  We can soon move on, deeper into Tyr's Hand.</RewardText>
