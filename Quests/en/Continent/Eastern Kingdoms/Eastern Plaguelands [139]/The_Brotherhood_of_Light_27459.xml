  <Title>The Brotherhood of Light</Title>
  <Description>The Brotherhood of Light has a history of brash, thoughtless decisions.  They bridged a gap between the Scarlet Crusade and the Argent Dawn.  They were among the first to plunge into Northrend, while many of us lingered behind.$b$bHowever, they also have a history of getting results, which I respect.  They fight on two fronts now: one battle in Stratholme, and another, more immediate battle to the south at Tyr's Hand.$b$bI suggest you speak with Angela Dosantos at Tyr's Hand.  You may be of service.</Description>
