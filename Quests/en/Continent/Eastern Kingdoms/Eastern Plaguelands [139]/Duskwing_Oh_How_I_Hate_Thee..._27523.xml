But I have never seen a bat as big, or as shockingly white, as Duskwing.$B$BHow he taunts me from his roost!$b$bThis albino demon bat circles to the southwest of here, due north of Blackwood Lake.  Track him down and destroy him.  If he flies too high for you to reach, use my flare to get his attention.
