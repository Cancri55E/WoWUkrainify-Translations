  <Title>Nobody to Blame but Myself</Title>
  <Description>This is my fault.  I... I ignored his warnings, his complaints, everything.  I couldn't help myself - I saw those Scourge just beyond the tower, and I... I HAD to go kill them.$b$bArgus says that Gidwin was taken northwest, and that's our only lead, so that's where we'll head.$b$bNorthdale and the Argent Crusade be damned!  We're getting Gidwin back from those Scourge trash.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Hop in Fiona's Caravan and ride to Northpass Tower.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We have no time, $n!  We must press on!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Time is wasting, $n.  Every minute we waste gives the Scourge another chance to kill Gidwin.  If he isn't dead already.$b$bNot that I think he is.  Giddy may be a stick-in-the-mud, but when it comes down to it, he can swing the Light like a champion.</RewardText>
