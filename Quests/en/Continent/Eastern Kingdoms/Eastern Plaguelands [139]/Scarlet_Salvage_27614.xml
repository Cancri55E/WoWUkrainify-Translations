  <Title>Scarlet Salvage</Title>
  <Description>This battle was won before it started.  Right now, we're just shooting for style points.$b$bWithin these barracks, the sniveling Scarlet Crusaders cling to their priceless artifacts, even though some of the objects are too holy for their now-undead hand to touch.  So they keep them in chests, hidden from the world.$b$bYou will find these artifacts, and bring them back to me.  They belong to the Argent Crusade.  They belong in the hands of the righteous.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Crimson Boar, Lihanna's Strand, the Shroud of Uther, and Gavinrad's Sigil.</LogDescription>
