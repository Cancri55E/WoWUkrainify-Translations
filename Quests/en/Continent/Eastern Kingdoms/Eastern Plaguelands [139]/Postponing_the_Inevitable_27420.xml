  <Title>Postponing the Inevitable</Title>
  <Description>You have a keen eye to have seen me here, hidden among the grasses.$b$bAhead of us lies the Fungal Vale, an area that the Scourge still cling tightly to.  They use floating constructs to continually re-plague the land, keeping it vile and polluted.$b$bThe devices are controlled with runes, which are held by dark adepts and shadowmages.  Take the controlling runes that these cultists hold, aim them at the plague disseminators, then overcharge them with this mote.  The results should be amusing.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain Control Runes from Dark Cultists and Shadowmages, then use the Overcharged Mote on them to destroy 3 Plague Disseminators.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>If the Cenarion Circle is ever going to return the Fungal Vale to its original, healthy state, those plague disseminators must be the first things to go.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The sooner those Scourge are pushed out of the Fungal Vale, the sooner we can heal it.$b$bThank you, $n.</RewardText>
