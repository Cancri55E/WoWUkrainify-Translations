  <Title>The Trek Continues</Title>
  <Description>I believe the horses are ready.  Argus Highbeacon, the gentleman who works with the Argent Crusade, spoke with me earlier.  I understand he will be coming with us... that's great!  I'll make room for him.$b$bI know that you are busy, so there's no hurry.  Whenever you're ready, hop into the caravan, and we will proceed to the next tower.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Board Fiona's Caravan when you are ready to move to the next tower.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Once we get to Light's Shield Tower, the boys can head over to Light's Hope Chapel.  It's close enough that they can walk.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We've enjoyed having you ride with us, $n.  Hopefully, once Gidwin and Tarenar join the Argent Crusade, we can continue to travel together.</RewardText>
