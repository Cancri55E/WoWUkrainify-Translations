  <Title>Argent Call: The Noxious Glade</Title>
  <Description>Browman's Mill, to the north, is infested with undead.  The Noxious Glade, even farther to the north, is even more heavily infested.  Despite their proximity to our chapel, we have been unable to completely remove them.$b$bVigilance is key.  Travel into the Noxious Vale and slay as many undead as you can find... and the cultists that roam among them.$b$bWhile there, make sure to avoid Garginox, the flesh giant that roams the vale.  I suspect you are not strong enough to defeat him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 16 Scourge and 8 Cultists within Browman Mill and the Noxious Glade.  Return to Light's Hope Chapel if Tarenar or Gidwin is slain.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The three of you still have a job to do.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You've returned sooner than I expected.  Excellent.$b$bWe will continue our path into the north.  Next, you will be completing a similar task - this time, in Northdale.</RewardText>
