  <Title>Amidst Death, Life</Title>
  <Description>Scourge forces have made it a point to ensure that nothing survives in the Fungal Vale - all you will find are husks of rotted mushrooms and scorched grasses.  The three corners of the vale are home to three large ziggurats, which they use to reanimate their dead and summon new soldiers to the battlefield.$b$bYet even in this evil, lifeless place, life finds a way to flourish.  Take my seeds and plant them in the centers of these ziggurats.  Prove to them that life will prevail.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Rayne's Seeds in the center of the three ziggurats in the Fungal Vale.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I am confident that nature will find a foothold within those ziggurats.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Even if the flowers died out shortly after they bloomed, they proved our point to the Scourge: they are losing, and we are winning.$b$bThank you for your assistance.</RewardText>
