  <Description>Baroness Anastar holds him?  Here in the Plaguewood?$b$bThe Plaguewood is a big place... but we will find him.  We WILL find Gidwin.$b$bImmediately to our east and our west are a pair of necropoli that flank the entrance to Stratholme.  Inside them, you will find a pair of death knights - Rivendare's lieutenants.  I doubt either would have any use for a paladin hostage, but perhaps they will have some information on his location.</Description>
