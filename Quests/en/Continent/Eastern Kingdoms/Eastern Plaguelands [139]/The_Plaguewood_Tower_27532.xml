  <Title>The Plaguewood Tower</Title>
  <Description>With the recent, unfortunate developments involving Gidwin, it might not be wise for a man my age to take the dangerous trip through the Plaguewood.  This is fine - I can visit the Plaguewood Tower on my next trip around the loop.$b$bI do, however, have a delivery that I need to get to Judkins.  You are younger than I, and stronger in combat.  Will you take this delivery to him?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Highbeacon's Parcel to Argent Apothecary Judkins at Plaguewood Tower in Eastern Plaguelands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Highbeacon's Parcel... is Argus safe?  Did something happen?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Whew.  Every time Argus comes plodding through that Plaguewood, I fear it to be his last.  It's good to see that he's wise enough to send a youngblood like you in his stead.</RewardText>
