  <Title>Into the Woods</Title>
  <Description>I saw the strangest commotion coming through town the other day.  A horse-drawn cart, loaded with crates and chests, a worgen woman at the reins, a blood elf by her side, and a dwarven paladin running behind, yelling some of the most creative obscenities I've heard in quite some time.$b$bThey looked like they were headed to Eastern Plaguelands, though I'd imagine they can't be far past the Thondroril River by now.  I wonder what they were up to?</Description>
