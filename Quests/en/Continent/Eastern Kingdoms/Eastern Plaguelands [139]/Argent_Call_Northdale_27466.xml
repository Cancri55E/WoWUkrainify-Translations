  <Title>Argent Call: Northdale</Title>
  <Description>Tyrosus has given us our next task: slaying more undead in Northdale.  Gidwin is excited to move forward, but I think we should show a little more caution.$b$bLet's meet up with Fiona.  She should be at the next tower by now... Eastwall Tower, I think it's called.  It's close by, to the northwest of Light's Hope.  We can rest there, and plan our attack on Northdale.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Fiona at Eastwall Tower in Eastern Plaguelands.</LogDescription>
