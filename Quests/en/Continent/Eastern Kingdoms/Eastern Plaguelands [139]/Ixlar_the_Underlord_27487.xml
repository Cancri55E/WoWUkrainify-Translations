  <Title>Ix'lar the Underlord</Title>
  <Description>I know we're supposed to head to Northdale, but that can wait, right?  Besides, this lovely little goblin was just telling me about some Scourge that are even closer by.$b$bSo apparently there's this nerubian underlord named Ix'lar that has been trying to make a name for himself ever since the Lich King was slain.  He's set up a camp of undead to our north.$b$bSure, Tyrosus wants us to kill banshees in Northdale.  We'll get to that.  But let's kill this nerubian first, while we're close!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Ix'lar the Underlord and 10 of his minions.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I couldn't stop him.  While you and Tarenar were out, Giddy ran north all alone!$b$bTarenar, you should have known better!  Gidwin gets so impatient sometimes, and you only egg him on.  If Giddy gets into any trouble, I'm blaming you for this.</RewardText>
