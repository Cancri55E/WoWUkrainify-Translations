  <Title>Marauders of Darrowshire</Title>
  <Description>I require a rare reagent for the powerful spell I intend to cast: skulls from the scourge who took part in the battle of Darrowshire.$B$BTake this crystal and hunt scourge champions for their skulls.  The crystal is enchanted; if a champion took part in the battle, then when you pass the crystal over its skull it will resonate.  Bring me those resonating skulls.$B$BGo, $n.  You'll find scourge champions in the Fungal Vale to the north.  Go.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 5 Resonating Skulls to Chromie at Crown Guard Tower in Eastern Plaguelands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the skulls?  They are critical for my spell, which will give us the chance to save Darrowshire.  Maybe.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent work, $n.  Are you certain you haven't done this before?</RewardText>
