  <Description>Well, I'm glad that Eligor and Korfax left some fun for me.  It was a battle unto itself to keep them from rushing headlong into the middle of this cathedral.$b$bThat's YOUR job, after all.$b$bThe cathedral lies ahead of us, the last real bastion of Scarlet power remaining.  Within it, Crusader Lord Valdelmar sits atop Tyr's Hand's crumbling pulpit of lies.$b$bThere will be no escape; there will be no mercy.  The last simpering vestiges of the Scarlet Crusade end here.  Slay him.</Description>

  <RewardText>While I can't agree with their methods, I can't argue with their results.  In many ways, the Scarlet Crusade were well-intentioned, but their zeal grew too strong, and their hate blinded them to reason.$b$bI only hope that the same doesn't happen to our Brotherhood of Light.</RewardText>
