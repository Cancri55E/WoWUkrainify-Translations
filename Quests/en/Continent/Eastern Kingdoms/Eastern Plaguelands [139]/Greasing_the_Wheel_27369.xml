  <Title>Greasing the Wheel</Title>
  <Description>Sorry about that.  I was pretty sure you were one of those spider-beasts, doing a bad $r impression.$b$bHow do you do?  Gidwin Goldbraids, at your service.  I'm in a bit of a hurry back to my caravan, but I was wondering if you might do me one last favor?  My pal Fiona runs a small shop, and she could probably use some of these herbs that grow along the river shore.$b$bI'm thinking if we give her some nice herbs, she'll be MUCH less likely to murder me.  That's the plan, anyway.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Loot 10 Banshee's Bells from the shore of the Thondroril River.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Giddy's got you mixed up in all of this now?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I'll tear that pint-size paladin to shreds before he... wait a minute are those Banshee's Bells?  You brought these for me?$b$bOh, Gidwin asked you to get them for me!  That sweet little guy.  Alright.  He's off the hook for now.</RewardText>
