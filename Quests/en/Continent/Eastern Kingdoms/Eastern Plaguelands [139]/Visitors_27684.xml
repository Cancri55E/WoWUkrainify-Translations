  <Title>Visitors</Title>
  <Description>My sources at the Menders' Stead have informed me that we will be having some visitors soon.  A group of paladins - led by a worgen tradeswoman, of all things - will be arriving here shortly.  I look forward to meeting them.  Particularly one of them.$b$bWould you mind stopping in and checking in on them?  I can't say for sure, but by the time you get there, they should just be crossing the Thondroril River, far to the west.</Description>
