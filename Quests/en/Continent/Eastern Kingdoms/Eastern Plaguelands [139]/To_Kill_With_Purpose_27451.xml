  <Title>To Kill With Purpose</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, stranger!  You've entered the heart of the Plaguelands.  I hope you brought your undead-killing gear with you.$b$bThe plague spreads more slowly these days, so the Cult of the Damned has stepped up production in order to keep the land brown and dead, as they like it.  I've got a plan to stop them.  Take my mortar and pestle, and use it on living rot from the undead creatures in Corin's Crossing to the southeast.  We're going to make a little present for the cultists!</Description>

  <RewardText>Hello!  It's me.  Hope you don't mind a little home-brewed magic to allow me to communicate with you in the field.  It'll save us both some time.$b$bWe're going to incorporate that living rot into a mixture that'll ruin their next batch of plague.  That'll show them!</RewardText>
