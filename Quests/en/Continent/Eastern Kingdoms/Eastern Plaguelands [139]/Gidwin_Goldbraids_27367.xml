  <Title>Gidwin Goldbraids</Title>
  <Description>I love my boys, don't get me wrong.  But I TOLD them that I needed FIVE MINUTES to water and brush the horses, and what did they do?  They made a stupid bet with each other and ran off!  I should have known better... this always happens.$b$bGidwin's the short one.  He headed north, along the river.  If you're headed that direction, would you tell him to come back?  We've got to get to Light's Hope Chapel, and I'm not against leaving without him.</Description>
