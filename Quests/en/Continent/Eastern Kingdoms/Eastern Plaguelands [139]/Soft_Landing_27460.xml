  <Title>Soft Landing</Title>
  <Description>We were only given one hundred men to complete this mission, and we're already down by one.  Our scout was sent into the enemy stronghold to clear out some of the guards that patrol the area, and to send off a flare so we could enter with a coordinated attack.  Our ninety-nine remaining men lie at the ready, waiting for that flare.  I need a talented $c like you to sneak into Tyr's Hand, take out as many of their guards as possible, and then set off that flare.$b$bAre you up to it?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill any 10 Scarlet Crusade creatures within Tyr's Hand.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The flare is fully assembled, and the matches lie unused next to the fuse.$b$bThe fallen Argent centurion got much closer to setting off this flare than you had guessed.</RewardText>
