  <Description>My traveling companion, Fiona, runs a small vendor's shop out of her caravan.  She and I, along with our friend Gidwin, are all on our way to Light's Hope Chapel.  I'm sure you can join us, if you like... though Fiona might be a little mad at me.$b$bFiona always forgets why she's mad if you give her a gift.
