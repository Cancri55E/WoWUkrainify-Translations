  <Title>Tooling Around</Title>
  <Description>I'm in charge of supplying this dig. It's not that bad, but having to pick up and move out so fast wasn't exactly ideal!$B$BArchaeologists need tools, you know. You can't run around pulling up priceless antiquities with your bare hands. If you're going back to the dig site, can you bring back the tools that got left behind?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 6 Archaeologist's Tools.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Are they all here? We left a lot back there.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That's a relief! Maybe we can dig our way out of the hole we're still in, eh?$B$BNo, nevermind, just a bad joke.</RewardText>
