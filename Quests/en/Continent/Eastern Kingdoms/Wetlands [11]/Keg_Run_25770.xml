Forba Slabchisel's the one leading it...and believe me, you don't want to get on her bad side!$B$BShowing up with an armful of ale will help with that. Go and take this ahead to her, and she might even ask you to stick around for some work.</Description>

If you're of the mind to help Ironforge by takin' over the intended jobs of some useless, lazy sods that call themselves dwarves, you're in the right place!</RewardText>
