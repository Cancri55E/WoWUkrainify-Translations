  <Title>Incendicite Ore</Title>
  <Description>Thelgen Rock over yonder is something of a natural wonder. It's the only known source of incendicite in the world!$B$BThe stuff's rare, highly sought, and ridiculously explosive. Hit it with a steel mining pick and you'll set off a fireworks show that'll put a room full of goblins to shame.$B$BLuckily, I've developed a spark-proof pick for such tasks. I'll loan it to you if you bring me back some incendicite ore, and I'll split you in on the profits, of course.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 pieces of Incendicite Ore.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Well, you look like you're in one piece.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Glorious! Beautiful stuff, this ore.$B$BGood on you for not droppin' your pick. Last person I sent out let the butt end hit the floor, and that part's not sparkproof.</RewardText>
