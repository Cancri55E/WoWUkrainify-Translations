  <Title>The Crazed Dragonmaw</Title>
  <Description>The Dragonmaw orcs nearby are fast becoming a nuisance. Their suicidal attacks on the grove are merely annoying, though they provide my sentinels with some needed practice.$B$BMy scouts, however, have seen them rounding up black dragon whelps in nets. The last thing these lands need is a crude revival of dragon-taming. Strike out to the east, $c, and cut down the whelpstealers; make sure their folly does not come back to haunt us later.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 12 Dragonmaw Whelpstealers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The orcs will know better than to press further west now. Well done.</RewardText>
