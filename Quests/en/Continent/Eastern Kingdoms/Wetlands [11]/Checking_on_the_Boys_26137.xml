  <Title>Checking on the Boys</Title>
  <Description>I'm sure you've seen just how bad the damage to the Loch is by now. The damage spreads further than that, I'm afraid; all that water had to go somewhere, and it went down into the Wetlands.$B$BThere's a lot of fine dwarves down there trying to help out, and they need supplies. That's why I sent two of my mountaineers ahead with a cask of ale along the path into the Wetlands.$B$BI haven't heard back from them since they set off down the road to Dun Algaz. Would you mind checking up on them?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel to the Wetlands and speak to Mountaineer Rharen near Dun Algaz.</LogDescription>
