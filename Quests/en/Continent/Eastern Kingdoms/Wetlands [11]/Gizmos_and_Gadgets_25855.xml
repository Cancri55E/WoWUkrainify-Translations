  <Description>I've been coming up short on parts recently for my engineering projects, and the other day I finally saw why: the Mosshide gnolls have been making off with them!$B$BI don't have any idea what they could possibly want them for, but I need those gizmos back. They're probably strewn all over the marsh by now, but if you see any, could you gather them and bring them back?</Description>
