  <Title>The Stolen Keg</Title>
  <Description>You've got to help us, $glad:lass;. We were tasked with escorting a precious cargo to our fellow dwarves...a keg full of the finest ale you can get out here!$B$BUnfortunately, bird-brain over here fell asleep on the job! Those blasted orcs took our keg, and hauled it up into Dun Algaz where they're hiding.$B$BThis can't stand! Now, while I stay here and try to convince this idiot that it was his fault, I'd like you to go in there and get our keg back. For Khaz Modan!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve the Mountaineer's Ale from Dun Algaz.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have it? Is the poor thing intact?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank the Makers! It's downright pristine. Those orcs couldn't figure out the tap-lock, it seems...and couldn't hack through the mastercraft work of Ironforge's keg-crafters with their crude weapons!</RewardText>
