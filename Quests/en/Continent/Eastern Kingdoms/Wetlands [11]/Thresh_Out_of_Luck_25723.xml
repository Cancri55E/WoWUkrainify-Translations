  <Title>Thresh Out of Luck</Title>
  <Description>The local wildlife's all messed up from the flood, it seems. This fen used to be full of crocolisks, but I haven't spotted a single one.$B$BWhat I have spotted are threshadons. Never used to be any here, so the flood must've swept them all right out of Loch Modan.$B$BLucky for us, because they're tastier than crocolisks, and I'm running low on provisions. Bring me back some threshadon meat for the camp, and I'll gladly pay you for it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 Threshadon Chunks from Displaced Threshadons.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Are they meaty ones? Let's have a look.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Lovely. These'll fry up nice, and the camp'll be spared a week of mushroom biscuits.</RewardText>
