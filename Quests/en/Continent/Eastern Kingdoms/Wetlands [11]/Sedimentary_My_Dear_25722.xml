  <Title>Sedimentary, My Dear</Title>
  <Description>The destruction of the Stonewrought Dam was no small thing, $glad:lass;. We're here to find out just how bad the damage is. A mighty load of water's rampaged through here, and if it's disturbed the earth too far, we could be in for worse later on.$B$BWe can tell a lot from studying the sediment of the flooded area. I need as many soil samples as I can get, so if you could head out there and collect some more, I'd much appreciate it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 Flood Sediment Samples.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Let's see the sediment, then.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah, well. The good news is, these will do perfectly. The bad news is I can tell they're the wrong color for topsoil here, even drunk as I am.$B$BThat means things aren't looking good for the area, $n. But we've got more tests to run before we hang up the towel.</RewardText>
