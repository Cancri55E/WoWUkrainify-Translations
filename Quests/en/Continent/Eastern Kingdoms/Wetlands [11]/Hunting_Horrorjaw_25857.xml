  <Title>Hunting Horrorjaw</Title>
  <Description>I've been tempted to go after the big kill... the largest crocolisk out there, Horrorjaw. His hide alone would be enough to get my family out of this hole.$B$BBut I'm no fool. One mistake and I could lose a leg, or my life, and then where would my wife and kids be? Still homeless and without a father to care for them.$B$BIt's not my proudest moment, but I'll pick my family's safety over pride any day. Please, $c... hunt Horrorjaw for me. You'll find him in his shady pool to the north, lurking.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Horrorjaw and collect Horrorjaw's Hide.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get it? Do you have Horrorjaw's hide?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Amazing! You're a true hero, $n. I'll never forget what you've done for me and my family.$B$BI know it's not much, but please, take this with my blessing.</RewardText>
