I've seen hunters tame them.$B$BIt gets quite lonely out here, you know, even with Wenna to keep me company... a pet's just what I need to brighten my spirits. A little baby raptor would be the best!$B$BIf you're out there slaughtering the adults, would you mind bringing me back some mature eggs? You can tell if they're ready to hatch by the wobbling.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 6 Wobbling Raptor Eggs.</LogDescription>
