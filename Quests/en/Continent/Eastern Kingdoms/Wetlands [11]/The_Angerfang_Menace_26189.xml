  <Description>When we hauled up here to get away from the raptors, we put ourselves right next to a whole slew of Dragonmaw orcs!$B$BI've heard the stories in Menethil, how the Dragonmaw are even cruder barbarians than other orcs, how they strangle black dragons with their bare hands... I don't know how much of it's true, but I know we can't just let 'em sit up here in the hills.$B$BYou've got the chops for it, $n. Head east to the Angerfang Encampment, take care of those orcs, and make sure you get their leader!</Description>
