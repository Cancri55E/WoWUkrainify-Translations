  <Title>Who Wards The Greenwarden</Title>

The night elves came here just to find him, and after they succeeded they ended up settling down to the east.$B$BThey've got a whole grove over there to watch over the greenwarden, and I've heard he's been acting up, enraged by the flooding and damage to the land.$B$BThe elves are good people. They could use the help of someone like you. If you get a chance, go tell the head druid what you've done here.</Description>
