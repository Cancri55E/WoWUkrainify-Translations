  <Title>Swiftgear Station</Title>
  <Description>You've done good work here, $n. Askin' you to haul sandbags would be a waste, to be honest; I'd rather send you along where your skills are needed.$B$BWe've got a small outpost up north in the marsh. Swiftgear's the gnome that built it, but you'll want to talk to Shilah Slabchisel and help her with Ironforge matters.$B$BI'll admit, she's a looker... but I wouldn't make the mistake of getting fresh with her! They don't call their family Slabchisel for nothing.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Shilah Slabchisel at Swiftgear Station, north of Menethil Harbor.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Stoutfist sent you, eh? He's a good captain, runs his men well. Just wish he'd stop starin' at my midriff.$B$BDon't let me catch you doin' it either. We've work to take care of here!</RewardText>
