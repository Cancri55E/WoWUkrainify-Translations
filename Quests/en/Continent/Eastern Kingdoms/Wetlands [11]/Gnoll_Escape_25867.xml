  <Title>Gnoll Escape</Title>
  <Description>I know we were just attacking the gnolls ourselves, but I'm not about to let the Dark Iron capture them as slaves. For one, we found the thieves and took back what was missing, so justice is served; for another, whatever work the Dark Iron will be putting them to isn't something I want to allow.$B$BEither way, the gnolls need to be freed. The trappers should have keys on them, so use those to open the cages.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain Trapper's Keys from Dark Iron Trappers and use them to free 6 Gnolls from the Gnoll Cages.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That should do it! The more gnolls those fools have to chase after, the easier it'll be to keep them in line.</RewardText>
