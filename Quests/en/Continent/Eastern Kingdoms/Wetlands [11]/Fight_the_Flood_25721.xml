  <Title>Fight the Flood</Title>
  <Description>I'm here because Muradin himself knew that this survey needed someone to keep these buffoons on their toes. They're all too scared of the wildlife to do a thing! If I'm to get them off their duffs, I'm going to need some cleanup done.$B$BWe've got an elemental problem, first off. The flood did such a number here that the water itself's gone hysterical.$B$BI bet you've never slapped the sense into an entire lake before, but I'm askin' it of you now. Whallop those elementals but good for me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Flood Elementals.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Well I'll be. There's someone around here that isn't a disgrace to Magni, bless his poor gravelly heart.$B$BJust for that, you get first crack at the ale, $glad:lass;. But don't let it get to your bloody head! We've got more gorram work to do, and I won't tolerate you lettin' up early!</RewardText>
