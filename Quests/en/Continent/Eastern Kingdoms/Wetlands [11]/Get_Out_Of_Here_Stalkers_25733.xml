  <Title>Get Out Of Here, Stalkers</Title>
  <Description>Thelgen Rock's an important site here. We need to use it to study the bedrock formations an' such.$B$BOf course, it can't be that easy, so Thelgen Rock's also full of giant cave stalkers. Big as a dwarf and twice as hungry. Like I said, these fancy-lads are researchers, not warriors, so if I want them to get anything done you're gonna have to help me clear the filthy bugs out.$B$BKill as many of the blighters as you can and I'll make it worth your while, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 7 Cave Stalkers and 7 Leech Stalkers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Good job. I wouldn't be surprised if the horrid things had eggs in there somewhere, but it'll do for now.</RewardText>
