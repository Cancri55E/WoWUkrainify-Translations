  <Title>Give Sassy the News</Title>
  <Description>I'd celebrate with you, $n, but it feels like that dragon did a number on ol' Mount Kajaro. I... uh... I think I'm gonna grab my stuff and get on the first ship leaving the island!$B$BAnyways, you should probably head back to headquarters and let Sassy know that you won the footbomb title for us. I'm sure she'll also want to know about the dragon and Mount Kajaro.$B$BGood luck!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Sassy Hardwrench at KTC Headquarters on Kezan.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You're kidding, right?! DEATHWING?!!!$B$B&lt;Sassy looks panicked for a moment.&gt;$B$BOkay, this'll work out just fine. We'll throw your party and by the time it's over, I'm sure that the dragon will be long gone and the ground will stop shaking.$B$BIf not, we can always charter a ship off of the island.</RewardText>
