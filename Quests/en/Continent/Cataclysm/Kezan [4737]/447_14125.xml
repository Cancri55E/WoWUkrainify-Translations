  <Description>We're close, but we still don't have enough macaroons. But, I've got a plan: we're going to collect on the headquarters insurance policy!$B$BHope you don't mind, but I filled the place with the leftover fireworks from your party. All you have to do is go in there and sabotage things.$B$BMight I suggest the faulty generator, the leaky stove, and the flammable bed? Then, come back outside and use the control panel to send in the gasbot.$B$BIt's a foolproof plan!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Overload the Defective Generator, Activate the Leaky Stove, Drop a Cigar on the Flammable Bed, and use the Gasbot to set KTC Headquarters ablaze!</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This is nothing. You should see Bilgewater Port... the whole thing is going up in flames!$B$BFine, fine, I don't have time to inspect this place. Here's the moolah from the Bilgewater Cartel's insurance policy.$B$BI've got to find a way off the island! Good luck, $n!</RewardText>
