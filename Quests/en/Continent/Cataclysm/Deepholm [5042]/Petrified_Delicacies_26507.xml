  <Title>Petrified Delicacies</Title>
  <Description>Petrified bats.$B$BElementals of that size are picky. You're not likely to find anything better easily.$B$BTo the east are basilisks. They petrify stone bats that fly too close and snack on them when they grow hungry. You may find bats scattered around their territory.$B$BI must warn you... if you show that little elemental too much attention, you're unlikely to be rid of it. It can be very... needy.</Description>
