  <Title>Explosive Bonding Compound</Title>
  <Description>This guy's the son of the Earthen leader! He almost made it to the temple when he got ambushed by more rock flayers than I can count!$B$BWe know that the Earthen Stonefather has the middle fragment of the World Pillar. Maybe if we were to heal his son, the Stonefather would give us the fragment?$B$BMy heals won't work on Flint here. But if we were to get some of the quartzite resin off of these monsters, I think I can make an explosive compound that will bond and cauterize his wounds.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 5 Quartzite Resin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It won't take much resin. Those rock flayers are pretty dangerous though.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good thing that I just happen to be a grand master of all things explosively alchemical.$B$BThis won't ignite on its own, though.</RewardText>
