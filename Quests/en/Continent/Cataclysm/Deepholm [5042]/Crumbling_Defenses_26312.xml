  <Title>Crumbling Defenses</Title>
  <Description>When da attack started, we pushed out to take da field as quickly as we could. Dere forces were deep and endless... we underestimated dem. Now some of our best shaman be stranded out dere, exhausted, far from our defenses.$B$BMake your way out and take da pressure off of our stranded brothas. Even a small break in battle be a chance to get much needed room ta breathe.$B$BBe swift, $c.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Relieve Tawn Winterbluff, Stormcaller Mylra, and Hargoth Dimblaze by helping them to defeat their opponents.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Perhaps it was foolish of me to let dem be pressin' out so far. Everythin' I know of da earth elementals told me an attack like dis couldn't be lastin'... dat dey were just lashin' out in dere rage, and would be leavin' just as quickly.$B$BIt be very clear now dat I was wrong.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $c. Many Earthen Ring owe dere lives to ya dis day.</RewardText>
