  <Title>Lost In The Deeps</Title>
  <Description>Pebble has gotten himself lost again, somewhere deep in the Crumbling Depths.$B$BHe's fortunate that his size makes him unworthy of the effort for those gyreworms, but it's only a matter of time before he stumbles too close to one and gets eaten. Whatever he's so intent on down there is certainly not worth it.$B$BHe seems to like you. Please, go and find him and bring him out of those tunnels to safer playing grounds.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Pebble within the Crumbling Depths and lead him safely out of the tunnels.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You've done well. Now that these rocklings are free to learn our ways, they will grow tall and strong.$B$BOne day, we will extinguish the gyreworm infestation from our realm, and these rocklings shall no longer be plagued in their youth.</RewardText>
