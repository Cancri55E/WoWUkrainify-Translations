  <Title>To Catch a Dragon</Title>
  <Description>Having a dragon guard the fragment was a smart move on the enemy's part.  They can keep moving its location any time we get close to it.$B$BCatching Abyssion will be extremely difficult, but I have a plan that might help.$B$BThe Twilight's Hammer uses magical traps to bind stone drakes to the ground while they drain their energy.$B$BIf we can get our hands on one of these, we might be able to ground the Twilight Dragon for just long enough.$B$BGo east of here, to the Alabaster Shelf, and obtain a trap.</Description>
  <PortraitGiverText>They're using snares to trap the stone drakes.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Obtain a Dragon Snare from the Twilight Dragonstalkers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>If the snares are good enough for stone drakes, they might work on Abyssion.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Let's see if the snare can ground something larger than a drake.</RewardText>
