  <Title>A Head Full of Wind</Title>
  <Description>I'm no druid, but some of these mushrooms do not look to be naturally occurring. I know that our Stone Lord friend over there is eager to blame this on exposure to Azeroth, but I suspect more domestic causes.$B$BI saw some clouds of red mist to the northeast, near the water's edge. They seemed to be spurring new growth in their wake. Take one of my wind-devils with you and get me a sample from those clouds. You may have to stay close to the ground to spot them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Lorvarius' wind-devil to the clouds of red mist in the Crimson Expanse, near the water, and then return with a sample.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The fighting at the temple has quieted since you left. Whatever impression you're making, it seems to have helped at least that much.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You let the mist touch your skin? I hope there weren't any adverse affects.</RewardText>
