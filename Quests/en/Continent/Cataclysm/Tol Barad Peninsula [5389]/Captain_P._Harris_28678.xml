  <Title>Captain P. Harris</Title>
  <Description>The Cape of Lost Hope has been a sore in our side for weeks here on Tol Barad.  Half of our supply ships end up on the rocks down there.$b$bTo make matters worse, it's been overrun by a gang of undead sailors.  We have tried thinning the ranks, but they just seem to keep coming back.  Our last resort is to try and take out the captain that they report to.  You should be able to find him on a ship, just off the shoreline.$b$bOh, and I hope you are not too scared of sharks.</Description>
