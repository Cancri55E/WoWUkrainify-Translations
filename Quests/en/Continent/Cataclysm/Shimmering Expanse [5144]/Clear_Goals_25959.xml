  <Title>Clear Goals</Title>
  <Description>I see. The news you bring is grim, but I was not entirely unprepared for such possibilities. Without any effective scouting of naga numbers, I knew our plan was risky, but that's why we established this forward post.$B$BLet me put it to you plainly, $c. If we do not keep the naga off-balance, they will bring the fight to us. We do not have the structures or the men to mount a defense, so that is not an option.$B$BWe need more time. Can you thin their numbers to the south, under the far terrace?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 of the naga forces building up on the ground level, under the southwestern terrace.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>They're amassing infantry to the south.$B$BWe need more time. Do anything you can to clear them out.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>More naga are amassing to the south than reported too it seems. We shall have to move quickly then.</RewardText>
