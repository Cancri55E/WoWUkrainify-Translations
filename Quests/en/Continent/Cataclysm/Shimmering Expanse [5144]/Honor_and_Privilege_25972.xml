  <Title>Honor and Privilege</Title>
  <Description>All done! I'm confident it will work. And not a scrounger in sight to pop a hole in it this time! Well played.$B$BToldrek already swam up to catch it, all concerned about currents and what not. He said you'd get the honors though. Nice guy - don't know how he lasts.$B$BGo to the top with the balloon, take the flare gun from the crate, and scan the horizon for Horde ships. If you see any, fire the flare towards them. That's it! All there is to it.$B$BSwim. Float. Flare. Rescue! That last part's my favorite.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Swim to the surface, retrieve the flare gun, and fire a rescue flare towards the Horde Ships.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Those aren't trade ships, those are war ships. Still, this is an incredible stroke of luck. Fire that flare off and pray that they see it.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Perfect! There's no way they missed that, fighting or not.</RewardText>
