  <Title>Visions of the Past: The Slaughter of Biel'aran Ridge</Title>
  <Description>Look, I know this is asking a lot during a time like this, but I need you to tear yourself away from this defeat for a moment.$B$BI will tend to these soldiers - you need to find the location of that battle with the Kvaldir General to the west that you told me about. You should be able to glimpse more of the Battlemaiden's experiences from there. I have a strong feeling that the key to defeating these naga will lie with that Battlemaiden.$B$BPlease hurry - I will do everything I can to buy you time.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Witness the continuing story of the Battlemaiden by using her broken blade at the site of the Kvaldir General's death.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I know it's a hard request to head - a whim in a time of dire consequences. You just have to trust me. More than anything right know, we need to know why the naga are here and what they are capable of.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You're finished! Just in time. I don't think we could have held them much longer.$B$BAn artifact? Could this be something we can use against the naga? I suppose that would require finding it.$B$BWe may have to attend to more pressing matters first, until an opportunity to pursue this further presents itself.</RewardText>
