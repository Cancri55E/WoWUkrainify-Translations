  <Description>Ah, Battlemaiden. You carry with you the word and the will of our Lady. I might ask a favor of you...$B$BI need Fathom-Caller Azrajar and my Tide Priestesses to return so that we can begin the ritual. Can you carry my will to them as such? You should find them spread upon the temple terrace. Azrajar will be at the stairs to the north.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Seek out Fathom-Caller Azrajar midway down the northern stairs and 6 Sira'kess Tide Priestesses on the upper portion of the ruins, and instruct them to return to the temple.$B$BThis task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The threat may not be sure, but the Kvaldir are certainly not fools. They would not return if they did not have some confidence in victory.$B$BThe sooner our allies are summoned, the better. Find my Tide Priestesses.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The Kvaldir have proved a greater threat than we anticipated, but our plans are not hindered in the least. As our allies arrive, we will have a force more than sufficient to usurp the Tidehunter.$B$BAll that remains is to ensure that the ritual of summoning is completed.</RewardText>
