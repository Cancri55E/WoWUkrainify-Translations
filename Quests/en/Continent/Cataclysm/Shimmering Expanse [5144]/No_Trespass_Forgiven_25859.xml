  <Title>No Trespass Forgiven</Title>
  <Description>I know that you, like our revered lady, have unfortunate streaks of mercy that you succumb to at times. I would advise against such kindnesses this day. The Kvaldir are proud, and they will strike back if we do not cripple them completely. Kill all that you find.$B$BSadly, I have the inglorious task of making sure none return to the city, so you can go have all of the fun. I will cheer you on though, of course.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 20 Kvaldir on the Vrykul Ledge.$B$BThis task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Look. It's my job to guard the bridge. It may not be a glorious job, but it's the only one I have right now.$B$BGo find some Kvaldir to kill off in those ruins and leave this little slice of heaven to me. </CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Not one slipped through to the bridge. Not one.$B$BIt was very boring. I'd appreciate it if you shared a little next time.</RewardText>
