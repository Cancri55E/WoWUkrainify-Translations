  <Title>Stick it to Them</Title>
  <Description>I may be unable to communicate directly with the beast Nespirah, but I can still feel some things indirectly.  For example, I can clearly sense that Nespirah is not happy about the naga's presence here.$b$bWhen we first entered Nespirah's body, I saw dozens of sentinels and enchantresses patrolling the central chamber floor.  Perhaps some of the ancient one's pain will be alleviated if you remove them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 7 Idra'kess Sentinels and 7 Idra'kess Enchantresses.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Duarn is too focused on his task to notice your presence.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Can you sense it?  If you have an ounce of shaman's blood in you, you must feel the sense of relief in the air.$b$bNespirah is pleased.  Perhaps she will finally speak with us.</RewardText>
