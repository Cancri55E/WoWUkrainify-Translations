  <Title>Vortex</Title>
  <Description>I have no fondness for snakes, and even less so down here. Fortunately for us, the watery elements still bend to my will for now.$B$BTake these globes and throw them at the ground to send the nearby water into a vortex, pulling in all the nearby serpents. The naga will most certainly turn the snakes against us, so keep the orbs close at hand.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Globes of Tumultuous Water to trap 30 swarming serpents.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Yes, $r?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Too often, we are mistaken for druidic types. Perhaps that's true for some shaman, but do not let yourself be plagued by the ignorant belief that we are always peaceful.$B$BNothing about what I do is harmonious. I command the elements to my will. There is nothing offered in return. I would have it no other way.</RewardText>
