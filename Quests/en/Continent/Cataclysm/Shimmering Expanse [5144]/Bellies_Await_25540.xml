You've proven dangerous enough to be the sort.$B$BI highly expect that such a fine meal shall not pass uncontested by predators on the way back, so I'd make your trip as swift as possible.$B$BThank you for your help, friend. It's been a pleasure.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Hefty Sack Of Clams back to the Tranquil Wash.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You look to have come back to us with purpose. Was your trip successful?</CompletionText>
