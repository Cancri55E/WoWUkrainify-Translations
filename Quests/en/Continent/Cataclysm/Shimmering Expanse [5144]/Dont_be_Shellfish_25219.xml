  <Title>Don't be Shellfish</Title>
  <Description>I'm researching snails.$B$BYes. Snails. When you're done laughing, maybe you can help.$B$BI'm sure you noticed the gigantic shellfish across the ridge... well, I'm pretty sure there's something inside it. It has several points that can only be mouths or entrances of some kind, and I've seen those sifting snails squeezing in and out.$B$BI'm thinking that we might be able to use the snails to gain entrance ourselves. That's the theory anyway.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Coilshell Sifters.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I know, this isn't the most desirable work, but can you really help but be curious about that shell? It's immense. There has to be something more to it.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you. Seriously. If I would have had to endure another shipwreckee laughing at me, I swear I would have gored someone.$B$BI'll let you know if I come up with anything.</RewardText>
