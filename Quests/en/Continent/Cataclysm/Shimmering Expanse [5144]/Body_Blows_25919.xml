  <Title>Body Blows</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Captain Taylor listens intently to your recount of Duarn and Nespirah's conversation.&gt;$b$bI see.  So the creature wants our help waking it up, is that it?$b$bWith hundreds of slaves already picking away at her pearls, the beast seems to be a pretty heavy sleeper.  You might have better luck, though.$b$bMy suggestion?  Look around the creature's flesh for signs of weakness.  Maybe that weapon of yours will find a ticklish spot and force the beast to come to its senses.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Attack 7 Nespirah Abscesses along the walls of Nespirah's body chamber.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You'd better keep trying, $n.  These naga aren't going anywhere unless you wake the creature up.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hopefully we made some progress.  I'm not sure how we'll know when the creature wakes up, but something tells me that it will be pretty obvious when it does.</RewardText>
