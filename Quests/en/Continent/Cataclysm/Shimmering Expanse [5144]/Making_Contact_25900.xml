  <Title>Making Contact</Title>
  <Description>I can't believe that Nespirah would willingly allow these naga to take residence inside her shell.  As I see it, one of two things has happened: they have convinced her to willingly join their cause, or they have weakened her to a point where she cannot fight back.  Either one is bad.$b$bHere in this chamber, I should be able to communicate directly with Nespirah.  Let us find out for ourselves.  Speak to me when you are prepared, $c.</Description>
  <AreaDescription>Speak with Earthmender Duarn</AreaDescription>
  <LogDescription>Observe as Earthmender Duarn attempts to communicate with Nespirah.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Earthmender Duarn inside Nespirah in Vashj'ir.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <CompletionText>Nespirah needs our help.  If nothing else, I can sense that.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That didn't go well.  For some reason, the beast won't speak back to me.$b$b&lt;Duarn is clearly frustrated.&gt;$b$bIf only Erunak had not left us!  He would know what to do.</RewardText>
