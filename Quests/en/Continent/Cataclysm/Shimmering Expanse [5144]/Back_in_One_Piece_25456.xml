  <Description>Yeah yeah, I'm sure Felora wants you back. That woman has no respect for innovation. When I told her about the modifications I was making for my Earth Elemental, she nearly threw a fit.$B$BGo tell her everything's all well and dandy. And tell her she's not getting a share of my inevitable fortune either.$B$BShe probably likes sleeping on the rock anyway.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Felora Firewreath in Silver Tide Hollow.</LogDescription>
