  <Title>Unfurling Plan</Title>
  <Description>Survival kits never have any rope. It makes no sense! Rope and bombs, that's all they should store. The rest of this stuff is just a waste of space.$B$BExcept maybe the balloon. That's coming in handy right now.$B$BI bet those Kvaldir have rope. They're always riding around in boats, tying knots, dressing in nets. Go take some rope from them! I must have it for our plan to work. It is non-optional.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 Coils of Kvaldir Rope.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The rope ties the whole plan together!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is great! I love it. It should work per... ewww! Is this stuff braided with hair?$B$BDoesn't matter. Almost done. This thing will be ready in the twist of a rope.</RewardText>
