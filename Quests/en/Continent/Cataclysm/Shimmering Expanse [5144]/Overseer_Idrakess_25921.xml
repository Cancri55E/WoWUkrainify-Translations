With the Idra'kess' weapons, and Nespirah's pearls, we should be ready to bust out of here.$b$bFollow the wall to the southeast, and look for a ramp to the upper chamber.  I assume their leader is in there, or perhaps the key to Nespirah's awakening.  Hopefully both.$b$bIf you feel strong enough, head up to the top of the shell and look for some answers.</Description>
