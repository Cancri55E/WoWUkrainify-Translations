  <Title>An Occupation of Time</Title>
  <Description>Look--$n is it?--I need your help. I know most everyone in this cave thinks that we're not in a position to be worrying about anything but our own hides right now, but I cannot dismiss my ancestors so readily.$B$BThis was one of the royal cities of the elves in the days when Azshara was queen. In this city lie the keys to lore long lost and artifacts of unimaginable historical value. All I want from you, while you're out in the city proper, is to keep a watchful eye out for objects of significance.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Investigate the 4 intact statues in the Vashj'ir Gardens.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Let's keep the Captain out of this, shall we? That man has only vengeance on his mind, and his eyes are locked forward. The past is meaningless to him.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you so much for taking this seriously.$B$BThis is some of the first definitive proof of other members of the Vashj family. Very interesting. And I'd never even heard of either of the other two figures you mentioned until now.$B$BSo much of our history was lost during the sundering - it's exciting to have a chance at reclaiming some of it.</RewardText>
