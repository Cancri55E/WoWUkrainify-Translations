  <Title>Reoccupation</Title>
  <Description>There's no shortage of Kvaldir to slaughter. They're obviously still reeling from our assault.  The city has been desolate so long, I doubt they expected any naga to contest them here.$B$BThere have been no reports yet of their leader. I'm sure that culling them further will force the coward to rear his head soon enough.$B$BShall we continue?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Kvaldir defenders in the Ruins of Vashj'ir.$B$BThis task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I had heard tales of the fierceness of these Kvaldir, but so far, the boasts seem empty.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hah! It seems you were right. That broken trident is serving you just fine. I suppose I don't get to see you claw anything to death today after all.</RewardText>
