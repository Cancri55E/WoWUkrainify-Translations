  <Title>The Great Sambino</Title>
  <Description>If you're heading down the trench, I'd like you to check in one of our novice members for me.$B$BHis name is Sam, but he's likely to embellish it a bit. He doesn't really understand how members of the Earthen Ring work, but he tries hard, so we try to give him the benefit of the doubt.$B$BDon't get too wrapped up in helping him with his crazy schemes. Just make sure he's still in one piece and let me know so that I can have a little peace of mind.</Description>
