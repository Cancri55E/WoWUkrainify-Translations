  <Title>Not Entirely Unprepared</Title>
  <Description>I overheard your conversation with the Admiral. I know what we're doing sounds insane, but we really don't have much choice. There are people back at that cave that are depending on us.$B$BI've stationed lookouts on various ledges in the immediate area. They're burning ammo fast on the scattered naga scouts. Can you bring them more crossbow bolts to buy us some extra time?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver 8 Bundles of Crossbow Bolts to Alliance Lookouts positioned on ledges under the southern terrace.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Finished already?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You are perhaps the most dependable person I've ever met. I wish I could have more men half as thorough as you.</RewardText>
