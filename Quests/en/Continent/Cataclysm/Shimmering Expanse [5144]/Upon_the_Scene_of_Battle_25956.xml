  <Title>Upon the Scene of Battle</Title>
  <Description>All around you lie the remnants of a fierce battle. The naga skeletons are no surprise, but the weapons and remains of their apparent opponents are somewhat more unexpected.$B$BAmidst the bones, you spot a strangely prominent piece of metal jutting out from one of the skulls. It's difficult to tell what sort of weapon it might have once been part of, but it stands out sufficiently to prompt you to retrieve it as evidence.$B$BSurely someone back at the cave would be interested in this revelation.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the broken shard back to the Legion's Rest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Yes, $c?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>A shard of metal?$B$BThe remains you describe sound much like the sea vrykul we encountered in Northrend. We'll not be striking any alliances with their sort, no matter the cause. Still, this information may prove useful in the future.$B$BI will think on it further if time permits. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.</RewardText>
