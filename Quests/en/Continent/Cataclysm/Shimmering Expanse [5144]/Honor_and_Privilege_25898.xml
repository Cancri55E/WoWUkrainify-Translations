  <Description>All done! I'm confident it will work. And not a scrounger in sight to pop a hole in it this time! Fortuitous.$B$BJorlan already swam up to catch it. Swam up and stopped to wait for it. He said you'd get the honors though. Jorlan's nice like that.$B$BGo to the top with the balloon, take the flare gun from the crate, and scan the horizon for Alliance ships. If you see any, fire the flare towards them. That's it! All there is to it.$B$BSwim. Float. Flare. Rescue! That last part's my favorite.</Description>
