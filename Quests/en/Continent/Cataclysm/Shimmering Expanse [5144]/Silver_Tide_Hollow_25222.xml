  <Title>Silver Tide Hollow</Title>
  <Description>Most of the other Earthen Ring that escaped the massacre on the boats have taken shelter in a cave a short swim down from the ridge. It's tucked midway up a huge rock formation, west of Nespirah, the gigantic shell on the horizon.  I need you to make sure they're okay. There's no telling how many naga might have attacked them as well.$B$BI'm going to hunt down that Fathom-Lord. I'll send word if I find the rock he's hiding under.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Seek out Felora Firewreath in Silver Tide Hollow.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>A friendly face! Welcome!$B$BVery kind of you to come check on us. We're fine. A naga scouting force did find us, but I'm pretty sure none escaped. We should be safe for now.</RewardText>
