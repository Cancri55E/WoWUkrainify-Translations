  <Title>A Breath of Fresh Air</Title>
  <Description>Legionnaire Nazgrim and many of the other survivors have already made their way to the surface. I'm sure some are just looking to rid themselves of this place for good, but we still have work to do if we're going to stop the naga from invading the plane of water.$B$BFirst, we need to set eyes on the tentacled fiend that destroyed our ships when we first arrived - we don't want a repeat of that nightmare.$B$BFiasco left these behind for you. They should speed your trip up a bit.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Legionnaire Nazgrim aboard the Stygian Bounty, on the surface above the Ruins of Vashj'ir.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Looks like you make it out in one piece, $c!$B$BIt's good to be out of that foul pit of water for a moment, and to have some resources at our disposal again. Don't get too comfortable though, we still have a grim task ahead.$B$BWhat about you? Had enough honor for one day, or do you want to get back in there and make Hellscream proud?</RewardText>
