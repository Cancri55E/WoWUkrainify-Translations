  <Title>Swift Approach</Title>
  <Description>I've taken the liberty of performing some preliminary scouting. The naga may not be aware of our position, but they are not entirely unprepared for intruders.$B$BBeyond their patrols, they have set up magical sentry devices that will warn them of unwelcome guests. Fortunately, they seem to have sacrificed quality for quantity, and there is definitely a window in which the devices can be destroyed before their alarms are answered.$B$BI trust that you can see to this before our other soldiers arrive.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy 8 Azsh'ir Monitors.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It seems clear that they do not take us seriously, which actually worries me. We have no idea how many of these naga there really are. As time passes, I grow to fear that the shell we escaped was only a small piece of a very large puzzle.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n, and just in time too. The Captain just started sending more men out. Strong axe arms, but I doubt they possess quite the same awareness and finesse that you do.$B$BWe were lucky to have you here when things went south. I suspect you will have a large role to play in things to come as well.</RewardText>
