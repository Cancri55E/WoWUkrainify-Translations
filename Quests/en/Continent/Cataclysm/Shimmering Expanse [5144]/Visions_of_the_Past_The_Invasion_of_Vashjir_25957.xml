  <Title>Visions of the Past: The Invasion of Vashj'ir</Title>
  <Description>The shard you recovered looks to be of naga origin. I had hoped to find a strong focal object like this for a spell I've been working on that would allow us to glimpse into the recent past.$B$BI've enchanted the blade, but you'll have to take it to a place where we know its owner was. I want you to travel back to the site where you found it and use the blade.$B$BPerhaps we can uncover more behind what the naga are doing here. Or even better, maybe we'll uncover a weakness that will give us a better chance.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at the battle site at the southeast end of the ruins.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>That took longer than expected. Did you learn anything useful? Who did the blade belong to?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>A Battlemaiden? I never heard of such a thing.$B$BThe way you explain it, it sounds like the naga forces are far greater in scope than the Captain could possibly have realized. We might be able to learn more through the blade if we can find other locations where this Battlemaiden was present, but the information you gave me makes me fear for the captain and his soldiers. We must warn them.</RewardText>
