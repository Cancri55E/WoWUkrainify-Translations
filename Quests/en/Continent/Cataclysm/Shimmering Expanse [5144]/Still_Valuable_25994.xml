  <Title>Still Valuable</Title>
  <Description>My time in the pearl pits, however short, has made me curious about the naga's goals.  Yes, I now know that the naga want to use Nespirah as an engine of war, but if that's the case, then why are they enslaving men to mine her pearls?$b$bAssuming we escape this creature's hull, I would very much like to study these objects.  The pearls we found in the pits were much too large to carry, but I've seen the warlords and prophets occasionally carrying around smaller ones.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 5 Mysterious Pearls from Idra'kess Warlords and Idra'kess Prophets inside of Nespirah.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The naga must have some ulterior motive with these pearls.  If I had time to study them, I'm certain I could figure it out.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Brilliant work!$b$b&lt;Tulra tucks the pearls away beneath her armor.&gt;$b$bNow I just need you and Legionnaire Nazgrim to get me safely out of here.  I can handle the studies from there on.</RewardText>
