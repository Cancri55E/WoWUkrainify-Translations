  <Title>Deep Attraction</Title>
  <Description>I've been able to help some of the survivors make it to the cave, but it's starting to get hairy out there. If we didn't have enough problems, some glowing murlocs started creeping up from the nearby crevice to attack the stranded survivors.$B$BThe men up there are warriors--they won't go down without a fight--but they're much worse for the wear after that damned shell.$B$BIf you have any breath left in your lungs, get up there and take out some of those murlocs. Hellscream's eyes are upon you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Redgill Scavengers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I don't know how long the men up there can hold out. Between exhaustion, limited air, and those murlocs, they're going to get worn down quickly.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You know what it is to carry yourself with honor, $c. You do Hellscream proud.</RewardText>
