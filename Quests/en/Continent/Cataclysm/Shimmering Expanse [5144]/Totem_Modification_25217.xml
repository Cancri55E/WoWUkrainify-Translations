I need samples. More samples. Samples from everywhere!$B$BI've modified my earth totems to drill through the sand and store samples of the rock underneath. Go find a nice spot and plant one.$B$BThe shaking and rumbling will probably attract all the cute, curious wildlife, so maybe you can make some friends while you're at it.</Description>
