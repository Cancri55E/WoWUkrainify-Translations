  <Title>Art of Attraction</Title>
  <Description>I have an idea. A brilliant idea! Those clown-looking fish have developed a symbiotic defensive relationship with the anemones. Having dismissed anemone disguise plausibilities, I've uncovered the chemical attractor that lures the fish.$B$BI have a gyrocoptic thermascrub extractor that I've brought down to take samples. Use it to extract the chemical attractor from several of the anemones, then bring the samples back to me for rapid synthesis and deployment.$B$BGo with haste! Brilliance is waiting!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Anemone Chemical Extraction Device to gather 8 Anemone Chemical Samples from the red anemones along the walls of Glimmerdeep Gorge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>These chemicals are of utmost importance to my defensive diving strategies. Delay not, for we all all in murloc-laced peril!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Superb! Chemicals abound!$B$BMy instantaneous chemical synthesizer is already pre-tested and prepared. Your deployment compound shall be ready in the blink of an eye!</RewardText>
