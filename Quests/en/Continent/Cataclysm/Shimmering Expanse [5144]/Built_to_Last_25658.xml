  <Description>My lady, I have a request from the High Priestess that I am to pass along to you. Many of the city's defenses remain from long before it sunk beneath the waves, and some of them are but a trivial task to reactivate, were it not for the countless Kvaldir that stand in our way.$B$BWe are told you are to be fighting on Nar'shola Terrace above us. You would do my lady a great service if you would but touch some of the devices as you pass. Your noble blood should prove more than sufficient to reactivate them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Reactivate 6 Nar'shola Wards on the middle level of the ruins: Narshola Terrace.$B$BThis task is part of a Naz'jar Battlemaiden vision. If needed, use the Blade of the Naz'jar Battlemaiden at a time focus to return to the vision.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The High Priestess sends her thanks for agreeing to aid us in our duties.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The Nar'shola Wards are performing perfectly. I will inform the Mistress of the Tides of your aid immediately.$B$BThank you for your assistance, my lady. </RewardText>
