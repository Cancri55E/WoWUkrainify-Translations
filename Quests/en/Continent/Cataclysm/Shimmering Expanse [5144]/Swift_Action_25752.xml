  <Title>Swift Action</Title>
  <Description>We have everything we need to begin the attack.$B$BIf your claims were correct, you would do well to make sure you cling tight to your mount as we make the attack. Anyone who gets caught in the open water isn't likely to out-swim a naga.$B$BKill as many as you can as we make the attack run and we'll rendezvous on the broken ledge of the terrace above once we've expended our explosives. Hopefully by that point there will be few enough that we can finish them off the old-fashioned way.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Engineer Hexascrub just outside of the building to join the assault, then use your improvised explosives to kill 100 Azsh'ir Soldiers, 20 Azsh'ir Wave Screamers, and 12 Azsh'ir Archaens.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Speak to Enginner Hexascrub to secure a mount for the assault.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You did great up there! You devastated their ranks, but there were far more than we accounted for, and most of our men went down out there in the masses of naga.$B$BWe'll need to hold this position as long as possible to buy them time. Hopefully some of them will still make it to the rendezvous.</RewardText>
