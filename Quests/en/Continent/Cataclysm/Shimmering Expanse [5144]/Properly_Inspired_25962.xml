  <Title>Properly Inspired</Title>
  <Description>Been all over the place. Blown all kinds of things up. I thought I might have some trouble carrying on the trend, what with the water and all, but it's all just a matter of inspiration.$B$BI found something volatile enough to make bombs out of! There's a bunch of kelp hanging under the terrace to the southwest. Normally kelp stores gas that makes it float - this kelp produces a different kind of heavy gas. It keeps it hanging, but also makes for great explosions.$B$BGather me some?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 8 Bloated Kelp Bulbs hanging under the southwestern terrace.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Tick, tock, tick, tock. Always in such a hurry. No time for innovation. What I wouldn't give for a lab again!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You are brave indeed! I've seen you battling all manner of murloc, naga, and pointy-toothed fish, but that was nothing! The way you just sling those kelp bulbs under your arm like that is a whole new kind of fearless. BOOM! You could blow up at any second.$B$BYou're my kind of $r.</RewardText>
