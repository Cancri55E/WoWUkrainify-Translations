  <Title>Gauging Success</Title>
  <Description>Vicious louts... they did a lot of damage with those spears.$B$B&lt;The admiral winces slightly as he clutches a wound on his side.&gt;$B$BWe'll hold here as long as we can for all the men to make it. I need someone to scout their numbers to see how much damage we did.$B$BOne of the biggest groups of them was around the corner on the northwest portion of this round terrace, and the other was a bit farther to the north in the small tunnel, also on this middle level of the ruins.$B$BUp for some scouting?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Scout the northwestern portion of the circular terrace and the tunnel under the main stairs to the north. Both locations are on Nar'shola Terrace, the middle level of the ruins.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Any word... on their numbers?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Still so many? They must want something very important here to come in such numbers.$B$BI will be honest with you, $n, because you deserve at least that: I don't know how much hope there is. We will retreat shortly, but we won't be able to defend ourselves when they strike back. We don't have anywhere to run... we're running out of options.$B$BI'm sorry, I should keep such thoughts to myself. Do me a favor and don't mention any of that to the men. I'll figure something out.</RewardText>
