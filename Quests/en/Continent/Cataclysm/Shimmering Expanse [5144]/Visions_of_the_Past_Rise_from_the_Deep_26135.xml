  <Title>Visions of the Past: Rise from the Deep</Title>
  <Description>What you told me of the naga before has been plaguing my mind. Who are these allies they're summoning? Do they really think they can defeat the Tidehunter?$B$BEscaping this cave brings a degree of relief, but our purpose here remains. I'm hoping you will be willing to seek answers from the Battlemaiden one last time.$B$BThere's only one place that I can think of where they would have taken the artifact - the temple atop the ruins. It's sure to be well guarded. Proceed carefully.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Witness the concluding story of the Battlemaiden by using her broken blade somewhere in the Temple of Quel'Dormir.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The ruins are surely still swarming with naga. Pay close attention to their patrols and I'm sure you'll be able to slip through.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Minions of the Old God? Two very potent foes have joined forces then. Their hope to defeat the Tidehunter may not be so foolish after all.$B$B$n, we can't let that happen. If Azshara defeats the Tidehunter and takes his power for herself, I'm not sure any number of us could ever hope to oppose her on the seas.$B$BThe first step is clear at least - we need to hunt down the fiend that destroyed our ships. The navy was confident enough to bring in a new fleet, perhaps they have a plan.</RewardText>
