  <Title>Not Entirely Unprepared</Title>
  <Description>I overheard your conversation with the Captain. I know what we're doing sounds insane, but we really don't have much choice. There are people back at that cave that are depending on us.$B$BI've stationed lookouts on various ledges in the immediate area. They're burning ammo fast on the scattered naga scouts. Bring them more crossbow bolts to buy us some extra time.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver 8 Bundles of Crossbow Bolts to Horde Lookouts on ledges around the north end of Quel'Dormir Gardens.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Finished already?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You are perhaps the most dependable $r I've ever met. I wish I could have more men that showed half as much pride as you do.</RewardText>
