  <Title>Capture the Crab</Title>
  <Description>Everything in my body tells me that Nespirah is trying to speak with me, but I cannot hear her.  Perhaps the naga have done something to her voice.$b$b&lt;Duarn thinks to himself for a moment.&gt;$b$bNespirah's voice may be suppressed... that means... we need to find a voice for her!$b$bI've got it!  The Idra'kess have been known to train deepseeker crabs as battle companions.  Use this net to capture a crab, and bring it to me.  You will likely find them prowling the chamber's outer edges.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Duarn's Net to capture a Deepseeker Crab inside of Nespirah.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I hope this works.  My skills as a shaman are limited, and I fear that this task may be too much for us.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Duarn looks at the crab and disguises a frown.&gt;$b$bIt doesn't look very impressive, does it?</RewardText>
