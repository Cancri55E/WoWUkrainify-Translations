  <Title>An Occupation of Time</Title>
  <Description>Look--$n is it?--I need your help. I know most everyone in this cave thinks that we're not in a position to be worrying about anything but our own hides right now, but I cannot dismiss my ancestors so readily.$B$BAll I want from you, while you're out in the city proper, is to keep a watchful eye out for objects of significance. The statues interest me especially.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Investigate the 4 intact statues in the Vashj'ir Gardens.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Let's keep the Admiral out of this, shall we? That man has only vengeance on his mind, and his eyes are locked forward. The past is meaningless to him.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you so much for taking this seriously.$B$BThis is some of the first definitive proof of other members of the Vashj family. Very interesting. And I'd never even heard of either of the other two figures you mentioned until now.$B$BSo much of our history was lost during the sundering - it's exciting to have a chance at reclaiming some of it.</RewardText>
