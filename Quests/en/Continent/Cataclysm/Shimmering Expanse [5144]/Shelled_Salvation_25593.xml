  <Title>Shelled Salvation</Title>
  <Description>A lot of the men haven't made it to the cave yet. It's a safe bet that they're stranded at the vents on the ridge above us.$B$BWe found some spiralung shells on the way here. They don't produce much air, but it was enough for us to make the cave.$B$BI need to stay here to count heads and get them back on their feet as they arrive. Do me a favor - go collect those spiralung shells, get them to any of my men that are still up on the ridge, and give them a swift kick in the arse so that they get moving.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 Spiralung shells and give them to stranded Nespirah Survivors.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We need to get back on feet quickly, before the rest of the naga find us.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $c. You've proven very useful.</RewardText>
