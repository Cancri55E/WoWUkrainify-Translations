  <Title>Properly Inspired</Title>
  <Description>Hello! I've been scrambling, scrambling to prepare for the Admiral's assault. He's got high hopes and high plans to blow all kinds of things sky high! ...or water high? That would do.$B$BBlowing things high takes EXPLOSIVES! I don't have explosives. It's saddening. Very saddening.$B$BI've been properly inspired to improvise though, and the solution has become apparent. The bulbs on the seaweed hanging from the ruins contain a surprisingly volatile gas. Maybe you might gather some for me? Pretty Please?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 8 Bloated Kelp Bulbs hanging under the southwestern terrace.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Tick, tock, tick, tock. Always in such a hurry. No time for innovation. What I wouldn't give for a lab again!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You are brave indeed! I've seen you battling all manner of murloc, naga, and pointy-toothed fish, but that was nothing! The way you just sling those kelp bulbs under your arm like that is a whole new kind of fearless. BOOM! You could blow up at any second.$B$BYou're my kind of $r.</RewardText>
