  <Title>Goldrinn's Ferocity</Title>
  <Description>The beasts you see here, they're no longer my brothers from Gilneas. They've been corrupted by some kind of madness, and they've taken over the shrine.$B$BThey came when the Twilight's Hammer arrived in Hyjal, and they howl the name of some blasphemous mockery of our beloved Goldrinn. Forget about me - destroy these vandals before they continue to defile the shrine.$B$BAs you destroy them, look for the incense they carry and bring me some samples.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Acquire 6 Polluted Incense.</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>&lt;Ian examines the incense.&gt;$B$BAs I suspected. These reagents bear the marks of the Twilight's Hammer. And here, the name "Lycanthoth." I believe these are used in a summoning ritual...</RewardText>
