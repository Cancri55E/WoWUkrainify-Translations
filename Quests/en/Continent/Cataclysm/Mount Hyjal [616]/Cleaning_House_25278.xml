  <Title>Cleaning House</Title>
  <Description>Thanks to your efforts, we may soon be able to return this shrine to its former glory. But first we've got to secure this valley. South of here, a group of ogres led by Gar'gol has set up camp in a stinking hovel.$B$BI wouldn't characterize Gar'gol as a 'threat' so much as an enormous fleshy obstacle thrown into our path to distract us from the real danger. Nonetheless, he and his goons will have to be dealt with.$B$BKill Gar'gol's minions in Goldrinn's name!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill any combination of 8 Hovel Brutes or Hovel Shadowcasters within Gar'gol's Hovel in Hyjal.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Gar'gol isn't exactly the brightest torch on the mountain, if you know what I mean.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You really cleared that place out, didn't you? Well done!$B$BThe night elves once told me a story about how Goldrinn fought and killed a dreadlord, even as three others clung to his flanks, burning his flesh. I wonder if you or I will ever have the strength to do the same?</RewardText>
