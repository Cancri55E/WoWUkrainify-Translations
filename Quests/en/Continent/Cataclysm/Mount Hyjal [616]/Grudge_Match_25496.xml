  <Title>Grudge Match</Title>
  <Description>I don't know if you've picked up on this, but there's a bit of a rivalry between the ogre members of the Twilight's Hammer and the rest of us.$B$BFor me... it's personal.$B$BThis one ogre called Gromm'ko has a pet raptor named "Butcher."  He's taken out the last three of my corehound pups.$B$BI think this last one will fare differently.  He's got a real killer's instinct.$B$BGo to the Seat of the Chosen and challenge Gromm'ko to a match between our two beasts.  Humiliate him for me, $ndamus.</Description>
