  <Title>Sethria's Demise</Title>
  <Description>While you've been raiding Sethria's nest, messages have been flying back and forth between here and the shrine. Skylord Omnuron was at first reluctant, but I've persuaded my fellow druids to risk a direct assault on Sethria herself.$B$BEveryone agreed to my plan... provided YOU spearhead the attack.$B$BTake this signal rocket and engage Sethria on the far ridge. When she reveals her true colors and shifts to her dragon form, fire the rocket and backup will arrive to help you!</Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>Sethria</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>As soon as she reveals her dragon form, signal us for help!</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Slay the dragon Sethria. Once she reveals her true form, you will need to use the signal rocket to call in reinforcements!</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>If a minor dragon like Sethria can cause us so many problems, I hate to see what else Twilight's Hammer has in store...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Sethria is slain! I knew it was worth the risk.$B$BI'll stay here to look for survivors, but I imagine they'll want to see you back at the shrine.</RewardText>
