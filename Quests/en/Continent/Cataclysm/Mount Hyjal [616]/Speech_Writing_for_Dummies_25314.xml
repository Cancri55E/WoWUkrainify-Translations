He's scheduled to be sacrificed by the ogres of the Twilight's Hammer as part of this year's initiation.$B$BI heard that the initiate charged with delivering the speech ahead of the sacrifice is an ogre named Okrog, but get this: you were a close second.$B$BWe need you to deliver that speech if we're to free Jarod.  Don't worry -- I'll write you some cue cards -- just make sure Okrog has an "accident" as he leaves the Seat of the Chosen.</Description>
