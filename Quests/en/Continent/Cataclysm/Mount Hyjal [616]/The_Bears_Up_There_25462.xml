  <Title>The Bears Up There</Title>
  <Description>Do not fear the bears in this grove, $c - I have pacified them for the moment.$B$BMy concern at present is for the welfare of the bear cubs. The fires drove the little ones up the trees, where they've gotten stuck. We've got to get those bears safely to the ground!$B$BFlying creatures frighten them, so you'll have to climb the trees yourself. Look for footholds at the trunks. Climb the trees, grab the bear cubs, and toss them - GENTLY! - onto the target here.$B$BNothing can go wrong with this plan.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Climb up trees in the Whistling Grove, grab stranded Hyjal Bear Cubs, and then hurl them at the Soft Target from the top of the tree. This is perfectly safe.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Please don't hurt the trees. Or the bears.$B$BOr yourself.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I thank you, $n. Those little bears are shaken up but they'll survive.$B$BAt least the ones that hit the mat.</RewardText>
