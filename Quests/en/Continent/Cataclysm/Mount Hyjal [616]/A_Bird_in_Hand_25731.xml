  <Title>A Bird in Hand</Title>
  <Description>It's time to get to the bottom of this. We need to interrogate the matron of these beasts, Marion Wormwing. We'll capture her alive. Here's the plan:$B$BThe harpies communicate across the ridge using a series of signal fires. If we extinguish one, Marion is sure to come investigate.$B$BYou fight her as a distraction while I sneak up behind and grab her. I'll leave the questioning to you. Let's get her, $n! </Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>Marion Wormwing</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>Just lure her out and start fighting. I'll sneak up behind her and take care of the rest.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Extinguish a Harpy Signal Fire to get the attention of Marion Wormwing. Fight her until Thisalee subdues her, then question the harpy matron.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Marion used to visit the shrine here. Skylord Omnuron tried to give the harpies the benefit of the doubt, but I never trusted her. </CompletionText>
  <RewardText>So the harpies are tools of some sort of dragon - "Sethria."$B$BBut what are the dragons doing to those eggs? And what's this 'special' egg that Sethria wanted so badly?$B$BThis is beyond me, $n. I've given a report to Skylord Omnuron - he'll know what to do next.</RewardText>
