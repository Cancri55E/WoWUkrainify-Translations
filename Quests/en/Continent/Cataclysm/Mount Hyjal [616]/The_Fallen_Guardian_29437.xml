It was the green dragon Alysra - one of my very own! - who was in charge of keeping Fandral secure.$B$BWe can only conclude that the Twilight's Hammer has gotten to her. You must confront her, $n. Destroy her if you must - I cannot bear to see it.$B$BShe was last seen in the Ruins of Lar'donir, west of the World Tree.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Confront and slay Alysra at the Ruins of Lar'donir in Mount Hyjal.</LogDescription>
