  <Title>Scrambling for Eggs</Title>
  <Description>There's a pattern to these Wormwing attacks. While groups make a showy assault on the shrine itself, others swoop into the nearby nests and make off with eggs from all the flying creatures of Hyjal.$B$BThese animals are under our protection. Before we find out why the Wormwing are doing this, it's up to us to rescue as many eggs as we can from their talons.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 8 Hyjal Eggs.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Thisalee is cleaning her nails with a dagger. She looks up at you expectantly.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good, that's a start.$B$BThe birds who laid these eggs will never accept them again, so we'll have to raise these birds as orphans in the shrine here. Were Aviana here, she never would've let this travesty happen.$B$BBut, on to business...</RewardText>
