  <Title>From the Mouth of Madness</Title>
  <Description>I know of a draught that should jolt these gibbering former slaves back to reality. Gather some stonebloom from the rocks around Gar'gol's hovel, some bitterblossom from the shores of the nearby lake, and a darkflame ember from one of the braziers at the hovel entrance. The draught won't last long, so combine the ingredients at a twilight cauldron by the entrance to the hovel.$B$BOne sip of that draught should knock some sense into the brainwashed slaves!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather up Stonebloom, Bitterblossom, and a Darkflame Ember.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;The cauldron burbles, filled with a disgusting liquid.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;You dump out the current contents of the cauldron, instantly killing the surrounding plant life.&gt;$B$B&lt;The draught you brew in its place boils chunky and reeks of rotted cabbage. You turn your head aside and bottle it up.&gt;</RewardText>
