Upon it is bound a demon: Tyrus Blackhorn.$B$BYou may think me mad for turning to an old foe for help, but Blackhorn was once a mortal, and I can't imagine he wants to watch Twilight's Hammer triumph.$B$BSpeak with Blackhorn, and see if you can convince him to help us in our fight. He may yet redeem himself.$B$B...Just don't set him free!</Description>
