  <Title>Crushing the Cores</Title>
  <Description>These searing guardians are murderous! We destroy them, and within minutes, they reignite from the ashes.$B$BI think there's a way to destroy them permanently, but we'll need someone who can fight through the front ranks.$B$B$n, kill the searing guardians and take their smoldering cores to the nearby anvils. Smash them on the Twilight Anvils, and destroy them for good!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Acquire 8 Smoldering Cores by killing Searing Guardians, then smash them against a Twilight Anvil.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Are they dead?$B$BIt seems like nothing we do can cool this inferno...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Great work!$B$BThere was a time when adventurers would collect these cores in order to craft mediocre fire-resistant equipment. But for now, I'm glad just to destroy these fiends once and for all.</RewardText>
