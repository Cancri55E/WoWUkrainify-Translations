  <Title>Forgotten Memories</Title>
  <Description>Have we met before? I'm sorry... but I don't remember your name.

My name is... Arylina... I think. My memory has been so foggy since the great explosion happened that sent us underwater.

Oh! But look! I can see the sun and the stars again... I wonder what happened?

I used to keep a diary, but I can't find it anywhere. If I just had my diary back, I'm sure I could remember more.

Will you help me find it?</Description>
