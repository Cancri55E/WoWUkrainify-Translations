  <Title>Glittering Shell</Title>
  <Description>Hi, friend. I just wanted you to know that traveling with you has been the best ever!

I will protect all of the wee ones that can't protect themselves!

&lt;Poen produces a crab from somewhere, it has a bright shell.&gt;

Hey, why don't you take him?</Description>
