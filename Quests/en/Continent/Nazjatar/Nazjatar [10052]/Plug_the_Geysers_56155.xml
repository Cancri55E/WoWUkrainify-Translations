  <Title>Plug the Geysers</Title>
  <Description>The geysers are dangerously unstable and will be erupting any moment now.

I fear that Azshara's misuse of the Tidestone is causing irreparable damage to the elements within Nazjatar.

We have to do what we can to prevent any further destruction.

Take this sealant and use it to stave off the next round of eruptions. In the meantime, I will do what I can to stabilize the elements.</Description>
