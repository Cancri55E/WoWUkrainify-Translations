  <Description>I have a gift for you, $n. 

This stone is unlike anything you may have seen before. To the uninformed, it appears to be a simple rock, but it is far more precious than that.

This is a scrying stone. It reveals objects that have been hidden by magic. When near an anomaly, the runes etched within will begin to glow. 

Use the stone to reveal treasure hidden away by ancient magic.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find treasures hidden away by magic within Nazjatar.</LogDescription>
