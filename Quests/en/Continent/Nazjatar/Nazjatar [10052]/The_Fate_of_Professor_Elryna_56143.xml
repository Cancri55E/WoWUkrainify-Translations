  <Title>The Fate of Professor Elryna</Title>
  <Description>From the looks of it, Elryna's story should have a very interesting end. This pylon here has been acting up, but I think I know why!

These things use memory cores, little crystals found within the center of the orb. I bet there's one in that old magi tower. 

There's a snapdragon that's bigger than the terrormaws in there so here, keep the scroll for now. It should help in your fight. She's a big one!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat the Snapdragon Matriarch, collect the Memory Core, and activate the Memory Pylon to witness the fate of Professor Elryna.</LogDescription>
