  <Title>The Lost Shaman</Title>
  <Description>Pardon me, $c. I am in need of your assistance.

Our shaman, Farseer Ori, left the camp some days ago to investigate a nearby disturbance in the elements. He took his apprentice with him, a young initiate named Odari. Neither have returned.

I am leading an expedition to find them and return them here safely. Nazjatar is full of dangers. The skills of an accomplished $c like yourself could prove most useful.

Will you help me return the lost shaman to safety?</Description>
