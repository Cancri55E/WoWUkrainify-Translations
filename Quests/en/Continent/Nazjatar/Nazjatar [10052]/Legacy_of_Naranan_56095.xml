  <Description>Hey there, $r. Mind helping me out?

You see, I found these pylons here and it seems they contain memories from a notable Highborne who lived here long ago.

I can't get any closer to the rest of em' because of the snapdragons. Especially the terrormaws...

Can you go and activate the pylons for me? We Tortollans love old things, and this is a potential goldmine!

Oh, and be sure to write down what you see!</Description>
