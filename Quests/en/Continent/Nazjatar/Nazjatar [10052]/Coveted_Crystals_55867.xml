  <Title>Coveted Crystals</Title>
  <Description>Locating the weapons cache shouldn't be a problem once we have the proper tools. A little light and a lot of bioluminescent fluid is all we need!

It all seems rather simple, doesn't it? But the key is in the Deepsea Crystal used to refract the light. 

I am told that the Bloodfin tribe covets these crystals, so it shouldn't be too much trouble to get your hands on one.</Description>
