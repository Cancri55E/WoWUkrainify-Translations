  <Description>If you find anything else in those chests that you don't need, you feel free to bring it on over my way.

Found a few of them myself. Don't look like they belong to the naga, probably someone that lived in the city.

Some are locked tight by arcane magic, seen the naga taking those back with them. Probably got the good stuff in there.

I don't know much more than that. If you want a history lesson, I'd snoop around the city ruins.</Description>
