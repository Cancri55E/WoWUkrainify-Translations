  <Title>Tome of Tears</Title>
  <Description>We've been fighting side by side for a while now. I didn't think an old salt like me could get any better at killing naga, but here we are.

I have something to show you...

&lt;Vim produces a book from his pack.&gt;

Worst thing we can do is forget.

So many names I've written in this book, each and every one of them an Unshackled. All of them gone, now.

I will never forget their names.

I want you to have it. Tell people. Tell them who they were, and what we have done here.</Description>
