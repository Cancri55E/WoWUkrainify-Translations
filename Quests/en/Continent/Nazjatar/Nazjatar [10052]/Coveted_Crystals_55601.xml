  <Title>Coveted Crystals</Title>
  <Description>Locating the weapons cache should not be a problem once we have the proper tools. A little light and a lot of bioluminescent fluid is all that is needed.

It all seems rather simple, does it not? But the key is in the Deepsea Crystal used to refract the light. 

The Bloodfin tribe covets these crystals, so you should have no trouble obtaining one.</Description>
