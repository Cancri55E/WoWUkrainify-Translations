  <Title>Snapdragon Claws</Title>
  <Description>Snapdragons are savage creatures that hunt in packs. Their presence in Nazjatar requires us to stay vigilant at all times.

They are crafty beasts, preferring to ambush their prey when it is weak or wounded. We will need to reduce the number of snapdragons in the area.

The last thing we need after a battle with the naga is to be finished off by a pack of blood-thirsty snapdragons!

Hunt down any nearby snapdragons and bring me a claw from each kill so that I may keep track of their numbers.</Description>
