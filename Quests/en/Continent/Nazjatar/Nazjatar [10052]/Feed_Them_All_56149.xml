  <Title>Feed Them All</Title>
  <Description>I am grateful for the help that your Alliance has given my people, but we are desperately short on food and supplies.

If we do not gather enough supplies to take care of both the Alliance and my clan, we will run out of food within the week.

Thankfully, there appears to be an abundance of fathom rays in the area, but I will need help hunting them in order to gather enough food for our camp.

Take this fathom hook and use it to pull down the fathom rays from above.</Description>
