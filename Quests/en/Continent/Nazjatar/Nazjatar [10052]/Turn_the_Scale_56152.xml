  <Title>Turn the Scale</Title>
  <Description>I am in need of your help, $c. I have been hunting the nearby hydras for their scales, but my weapon was broken in the melee.

The scales of the hydra make durable and resilient armor for our warriors. Our clan requires the scales to craft and repair our armor.

If we do not resupply soon, we will be ill-equipped in our fight against the naga.</Description>
