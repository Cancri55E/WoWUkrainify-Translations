  <Description>Champion, I have a personal favor to ask of you that I do not feel I can ask of any of my sentinels.$b$bThis... this is not on behalf of the Alliance, or the war, or even our battle against Azshara. This is a favor for me.$b$bWhen I was a little girl, my city was attacked by the Legion. Many of the survivors fled here only to drown or worse. I must know their fate.$b$bWill you help me search for signs?</Description>
