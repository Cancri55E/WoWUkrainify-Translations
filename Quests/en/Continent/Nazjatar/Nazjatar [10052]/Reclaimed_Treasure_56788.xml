  <Title>Reclaimed Treasure</Title>
  <Description>The naga have filled Nazjatar with the ill-gotten spoils of war. We should reclaim whatever we come across in our effort to put an end to their tyranny once and for all.

I noticed a strange looking chest in a cave nearby. It appeared to be of naga make.

We should claim the contents of the cache. There may be valuable items inside that will help us in our battle against the naga.</Description>
