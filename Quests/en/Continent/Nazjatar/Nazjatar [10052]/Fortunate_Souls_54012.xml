  <Description>$p, I am glad to see that you survived the wreck. Many were not as fortunate...

I am capable of stalling the enemy here for now, but this position is not defensible long term.

We need to find somewhere safe for our forces.

Once we have taken measure of the wounded we will push on. In the meantime, find as many survivors as you can.

Nazjatar will claim no more Horde lives today!</Description>
