  <Title>Mgglurky's Mugglrgl</Title>
  <Description>My cook, Mgglurky, lost his mugglrgl and he's refusing to work until he gets it back.

I've got a bar full of hungry murlocs and nothing to feed them until Mgglurky starts cooking. If Mgglurky doesn't find his mugglrgl soon, we're going to have a riot on our hands!

I don't know about you, but I definitely don't want to be the main course tonight.

There were some Bloodfins lurking around earlier. Search Bloodfin Village for the mugglrgl and bring it back to me once you find it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve Mgglurky's Mugglrgl from Bloodfin Village.</LogDescription>
