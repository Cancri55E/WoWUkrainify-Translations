  <Title>A Glint in the Darkness</Title>
  <Description>There are many treasures hidden throughout Nazjatar.

Recently, I spotted an object glinting from within a cave not far from here. It appeared to be some sort of lockbox.

I suggest we head back and investigate. There may be valuable items inside that will help us in our battle against the naga.</Description>
