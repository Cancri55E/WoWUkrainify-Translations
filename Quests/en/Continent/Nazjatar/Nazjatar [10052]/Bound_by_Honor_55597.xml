  <Title>Bound by Honor</Title>
  <Description>It is true that my clan has been battling the naga for generations, but it was only in recent times that we took the fight to Nazjatar. 

Our leader was slain by the vile queen, and now honor binds my clan to this deep ocean. 

We will avenge their death or die here trying. It is our way. 

Your mission aligns with our duty, so we will fight the naga together. 

Slay their forces and bring us one step closer to honoring our promise.</Description>
