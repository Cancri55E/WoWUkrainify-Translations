  <Title>A Little Edge</Title>
  <Description>In the darkest cavern. Below the naga city. You will find them.

Creepy little crabs with sharp and pointy spines. 

I think we can find a way to use them. Projectiles didn't work so well in water, but now...

Harvest some for us!

Be careful, some of them are much sneakier than they have any right to be.</Description>
