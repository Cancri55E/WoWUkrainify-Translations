  <Title>Sating Snapdragons</Title>
  <Description>It's time for the snapdragons to feed, but it's a job best left to someone a little more expendable. 

The beasts will eat anything, including your arm if you don't move it away quickly enough. 

Luckily for you, they've developed a taste for Chitterspine Roe.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect Chitterspine Roe and feed it to Savage Snapdragons.</LogDescription>
