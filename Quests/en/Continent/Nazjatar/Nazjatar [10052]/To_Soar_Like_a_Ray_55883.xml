  <Title>To Soar Like a Ray</Title>
  <Description>I like to find the eggs of the fathom rays before they hatch so we can form a bond with them.

At least, when we can't swim, we can fly!

Bring me a few more eggs to start a new thing - we'll call them Rayriders!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring back $1oa fathom ray eggs.</LogDescription>
