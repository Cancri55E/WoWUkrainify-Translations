  <Title>What We Know of the Naga</Title>
  <Description>I owe you a debt. That much is clear. 

My mind still reels from the zoatroid's influence, but I fear the others suffer more visible wounds.

  <LogDescription>Tend to the Ankoan's wounds and hear what Adaru has to say about the naga.</LogDescription>
