  <Title>The Mystic Chest</Title>
  <Description>We have uncovered many rare treasures while exploring Nazjatar. I believe that I have found yet another cache of valuable artifacts to retrieve.

Some time ago, I noticed a strangely glowing object in the distance. I believe that it may have been a treasure chest.

We should go and investigate the object. If it is a treasure chest, its contents may prove valuable in our quest to defeat the naga!</Description>
