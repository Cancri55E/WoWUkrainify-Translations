  <Title>Echoes of Pain</Title>
  <Description>These spirits... they are the Highborne. They were those Azshara held close. Azshara often played favorites, but these people... they were her favorites.

I do not know why their spirits are here. We should investigate further. See if you can communicate with them and find out why their spirits cling to these ruins.

How could she abandon them?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with the spirits who wander around the Highborne Estates.</LogDescription>
