  <Title>Naga Treasure</Title>
  <Description>The naga have stashed away the spoils of their wars throughout Nazjatar.

Earlier while we were adventuring, I noticed a mysterious looking cache. The chest is located deep within naga territory, so I imagine that whatever is inside is most likely extremely valuable.

We should retrieve the contents of the cache. Whatever is inside is better used in our hands than the hands of the enemy.</Description>
