  <Description>$n, we must seek out a powerful weapon to combat the naga who guard the Tidal Conflux. I am certain such an object would be in the hands of one of Azshara's minions.

Thanks to our new allies, we've tracked down the location of one of her handmaidens within the ruins of Zin-Azshari. The journey will be quite dangerous. Thankfully our allies have a location nearby that we can use as a staging ground.

I've marked the location on your map, meet with me there as soon as you can.</Description>
