  <Title>Rescue The Farseer</Title>
  <Description>My master, Farseer Ori, has been imprisoned by the forces of Queen Azshara.

Farseer Ori was captured while performing a sacred ritual to call upon the elements for guidance. I managed to escape, but the ritual has been left unfinished.

If we do not rescue my master soon, the elements will grow even more restless.

The elemental balance must be maintained. I fear what may become of my clan and our bond with the elements if Farseer Ori is not returned to us.</Description>
