  <Title>The First Arcanist</Title>
  <Description>Our situation is dire, $p.

The Horde fleet was decimated by the attack on Dazar'alor. This naga trap has claimed much of what we had left.

Survivors report seeing the naga taking captives. Thalyssra has gone on ahead to see what she can do to help them. 

I will finish up here while you aid the First Arcanist's efforts. My rangers will provide what little aid they can.</Description>
