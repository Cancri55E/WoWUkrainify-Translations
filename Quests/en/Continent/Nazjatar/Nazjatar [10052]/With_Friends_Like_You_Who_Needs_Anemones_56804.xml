  <Title>With Friends Like You, Who Needs Anemones?</Title>
  <Description>I sometimes amuse myself with excursions into Zanj'ir Terrace, where the naga tough guys hang out.

I grab things that could be useful and stash them somewhere I can pick them up later.

I haven't been down there in a while. 

I could have something in there you may find useful.</Description>
