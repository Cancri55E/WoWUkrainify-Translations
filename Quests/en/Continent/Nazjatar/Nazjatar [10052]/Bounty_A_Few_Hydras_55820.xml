  <Title>Bounty: A Few Hydras</Title>
  <Description>Our forces are desperately outmatched when it comes to the hydras. They are ferocious, tenacious, and deadly. We have retreated almost entirely out of the western region of Nazjatar.

If we are going to hold the line against the naga, we need to make sure the western region is safe for our forces. Destroy as many hydras as you can manage, then report to the quartermaster.</Description>
