  <Title>Plug the Geysers</Title>
  <Description>There are several geysers nearby that will be erupting soon.

Unfortunately, the elements in this area are not stable enough to handle the force of the eruptions.

I need someone to plug the geysers while I use the elements to redirect the pressure to a safer area of Nazjatar.

Take this sealant and use it to plug the geysers while I work to restore the elemental balance.</Description>
