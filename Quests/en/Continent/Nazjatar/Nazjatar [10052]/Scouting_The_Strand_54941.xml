  <Title>Scouting The Strand</Title>
  <Description>It has been a long time since we have heard from our scouts at the outpost.

They may have been cut off from us due to the naga attack. I need to check in with them and get an update on the movements of the naga forces.

You should come with me, this will be a good opportunity for you to meet more of the clan and get a closer look at our operation.</Description>
