  <Description>The naga have enslaved a tribe of makrura and sent them to labor as mindless thralls.

The naga forces may be more in number, but the makrura have an innate advantage in both size and strength.

If we break the makrura from their chains, they will surely overwhelm their naga overseers and put a dent in Queen Azshara's plans.</Description>
