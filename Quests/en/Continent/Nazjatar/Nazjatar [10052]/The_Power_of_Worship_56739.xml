  <Title>The Power of Worship</Title>
  <Description>I was once like them, stuck in a loop and waiting for Azshara to come and save me. Our spirits are locked to this place.

There are naga in the other parts of these ruins. They have these magical orbs... I think they are using us to fuel their arcane experiments. They draw power from our spirits and our worship of Azshara. This keeps us weakened and unable to break free.

Destroy the orbs. Breaking the connection will allow us to gain strength and move on.</Description>
