  <Title>We Can't Have Dull Weapons</Title>
  <Description>For a squid head, you sure are making my life easier. 

I guess you get to live long enough to complete another task. 

Our new weapons are forged from some foreign material that I don't quite trust. 

You won't catch me sharpening any blades, but the work still needs to get done. 

Get to it!</Description>
