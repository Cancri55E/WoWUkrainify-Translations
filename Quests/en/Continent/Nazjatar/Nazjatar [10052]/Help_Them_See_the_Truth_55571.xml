  <Title>Help Them See the Truth</Title>
  <Description>The information you have gleaned concerns me, $n. These spirits cling to this place because they still, even now, believe in Azshara and her reign. She sold their lives to the void and they still believe in her.

I know we have concerns that outweigh this, but I cannot leave them here like this.

Show them. Confront them and tell them of Azshara's betrayal.</Description>
