  <Title>The Dark Garden</Title>
  <Description>Look, $n, I know we have bigger battles ahead, but these gardens are horrific.

Innocent creatures captured and imprisoned for the naga's amusement. 

They bring them out, torture them, change them, break them... you get the idea.

Help me free those the naga have taken, and punish them for their hubris!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill naga and release the poor tortured creatures held in the Imperial Garden.</LogDescription>
