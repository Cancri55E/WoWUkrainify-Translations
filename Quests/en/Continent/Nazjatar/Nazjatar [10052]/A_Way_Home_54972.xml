  <Title>A Way Home</Title>
  <Description>We are only alive thanks to the ankoan and Azshara's desire to toy with us.

We will learn more of Okani's people in the times ahead, I am sure.

For now, we must establish a portal home. While Azshara is blocking our traditional methods of magical travel, I can sense a powerful convergence of energies nearby.

I believe we can use it to open a way home.</Description>
