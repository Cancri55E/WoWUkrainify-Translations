  <Title>Plug the Geysers</Title>
  <Description>The elements are becoming increasingly unstable due to Azshara's abuse of the Tidestone.

Geysers will be erupting nearby at any moment. Each eruption threatens to destroy the delicate balance of life on the surface.

Take this sealant and use it to plug the geysers while I work to restore the elemental balance and redistribute the explosive underground pressure to a safer location.</Description>
