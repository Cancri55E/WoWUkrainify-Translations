  <Title>Forbidden Rituals</Title>
  <Description>The naga use dark, forbidden rituals to subjugate the elements to their will.

But such rituals threaten to destroy the elemental balance that binds this world together. The rituals must be stopped. 

Fortunately, the rituals the naga use are too elaborate to commit to memory. The ritual instructions are contained within ancient texts.

If we destroy the ancient tomes that contain the rituals, the knowledge will be lost to the naga forever.
