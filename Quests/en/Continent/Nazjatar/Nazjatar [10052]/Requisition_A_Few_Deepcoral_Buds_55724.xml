  <Title>Requisition: A Few Deepcoral Buds</Title>
  <Description>Many species feed on the deepcoral buds from the tall columns that grow in the east. Fathom rays feed on these buds especially. We use the buds as lures for fathom rays to use as mounts. But with our stores so low, we will not be able to provide the air support we need across Nazjatar.

If you could gather more Deepcoral Buds and return them to the quartermaster, you will surely be rewarded.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Deepcoral Buds.</LogDescription>
