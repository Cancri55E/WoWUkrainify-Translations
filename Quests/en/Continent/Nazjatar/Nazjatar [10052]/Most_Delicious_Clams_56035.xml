  <Title>Most Delicious Clams</Title>
  <Description>This pool is filled with creepy fish. 

It is also the home of some of the most delicious clams you will ever eat. Fresh water somehow mixes into the ocean water in this one part of Nazjatar, and that gives the meat a totally new flavor.

Every now and then, we come down here and collect them for our friends in Newhome.

We could sure use some help with all these extra mouths to feed!</Description>
