  <Title>The Lambent Lockbox</Title>
  <Description>There are many treasures to find throughout these ancient ruins.

Sometime ago, I noticed a strange looking chest in a cave not far from here.

There may be valuable items inside that can help us in our fight against Queen Azshara.

We should go back and investigate the chest.</Description>
