  <Title>Most Delicious Clams</Title>
  <Description>Neptulian clams are an important part of the ankoan diet.

Many forget how important proper nutrition is during a time of war. A warrior can be armed with the finest weapons and training, but if she is not healthy and well-nourished she will be ineffective in battle.

Now that Mezzamere is home to your Alliance, we must work hard to gather enough food to feed our soldiers.

Gather as many Neptulian clams as you can find and I will see that they make it back to camp safely.</Description>
