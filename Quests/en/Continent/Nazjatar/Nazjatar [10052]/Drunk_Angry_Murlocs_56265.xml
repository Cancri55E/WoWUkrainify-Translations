  <Title>Drunk Angry Murlocs</Title>
  <Description>Those no-good Bloodfins ran off with all of the beer!

I've been experimenting with brews that only use ingredients native to Nazjatar, but it's still a work in progress. For now, I must rely on whatever I can scrounge up from the shipwreck.

My supply of beer was already limited, but now it's all gone thanks to those thieving Bloodfin murlocs! We're going to have some very angry customers here if we don't get it back.

Please recover the stolen lager from Bloodfin Village before it's too late!</Description>
