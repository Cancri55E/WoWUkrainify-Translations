  <Description>The naga are using these caverns as a hatchery for their deadly deepcoil serpents.

These deepcoil serpents are especially dangerous because they have been infused with dark void magic.

We must put a stop to this operation before it is too late. The naga forces are already quite powerful. I do not wish to imagine what would happen if Azshara also had an army of these deepcoil serpents as well.

Our only hope is to destroy the deepcoil eggs before they hatch.</Description>
