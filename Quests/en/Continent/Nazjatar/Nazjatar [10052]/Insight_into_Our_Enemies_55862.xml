  <Title>Insight into Our Enemies</Title>
  <Description>There's no telling what awaits us within this land. We cannot press forward without first knowing exactly what we're up against. 

Although our new allies have suffered greatly at the hands of the naga, their hardships will not be in vain.

With their help, we might be able to learn more about how our enemies operate.
