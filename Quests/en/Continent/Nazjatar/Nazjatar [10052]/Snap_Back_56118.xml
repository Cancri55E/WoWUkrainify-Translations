  <Title>Snap Back</Title>
  <Description>I have a favor to ask of you, if you would be so kind.

Scrollsage Nola gave me this scroll to protect me on my adventures here in Nazjatar. She is a kind soul, but her scroll-work isn't always the most...accurate.

You look like a brave adventurer who's seen a thing or two. Could you test out the scroll for me? While you're there you may as well cull their numbers a tad.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Scroll of Busting Power on Snapdragon Terrormaws and slay snapdragons in Nar'anan.</LogDescription>
