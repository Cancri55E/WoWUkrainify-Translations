  <Title>Scouting Undercover</Title>
  <Description>Entering the stronghold alone would be a death wish. 

The Zanj'ir slaughter outsiders on sight. 

The only way to get in without being killed is to appear to be under the effects of a zoatroid. 

Even then, the mind-shackled are put to work. 

You must obey all commands, or they will know your mind is still your own. 

Once the Zanj'ir believe you are mind-shackled, it should be easier to navigate their domain and uncover their secret.</Description>
