  <Title>Turn the Scale</Title>
  <Description>I have been trying to gather some of the scales from the young hydra nearby. 

Their flexibility and strength makes them incredibly versatile.

With all the cranky old hydra tromping around, I don't stand much of a chance. 

Can you gather some up for me?</Description>
