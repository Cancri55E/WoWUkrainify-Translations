  <Title>Good Girl</Title>
  <Description>I have learned so much by your side, I can't believe how many naga we've taken down!

When you first arrived, I was skeptical that you'd make a difference. We've been down here, fighting, for so long. I had almost lost hope.

But now, we see a way out of the darkness of the depths, finally!
 
I took in a snapdragon pup when we formed Newhome, been training her ever since. I think... I think I'd like you to have her.

She'll make a great mount... and loyal friend.</Description>
