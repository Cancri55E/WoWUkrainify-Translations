  <Title>Requisition: More Kelp Buds</Title>
  <Description>We need rations for our forces. While kelp buds do not have the same delicious taste as other options, it is nutritious and plentiful near any kelp forests. This makes it our first choice for making rations.

If you happen to find any around Nazjatar, please leave your stores with the quartermaster. The ones freshly fallen from kelp are best.</Description>
