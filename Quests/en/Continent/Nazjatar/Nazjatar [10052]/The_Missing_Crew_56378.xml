  <Title>The Missing Crew</Title>
  <Description>I can't believe it. Almost the entire fleet.. lost! 

We need to have ships out there on missions supporting our efforts, but how am I supposed to do that now?

If we are going to recover from this, I'm going to need my top people. I know the chances are low, but I need you to get out there and try to find them. Alive if possible.</Description>
