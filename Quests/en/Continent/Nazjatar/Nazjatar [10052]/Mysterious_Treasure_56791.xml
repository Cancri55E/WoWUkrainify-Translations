  <Title>Mysterious Treasure</Title>
  <Description>We have located many treasure hoards while exploring Nazjatar. I believe that I have found yet another cache for us to liberate.

Some time ago, I noticed a mysterious looking chest. It is held in an extremely dangerous area, so whatever it contains must be valuable.

We should embark on a mission to liberate the contents of the cache. Whatever is inside is better used in our hands than the hands of the enemy.</Description>
