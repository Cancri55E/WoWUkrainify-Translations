  <Title>We've Got Crabs!</Title>
  <Description>$n, you're just in time. Everything's ready for the crab hunt!

Okay, okay... I know what you're thinking. A founding member of D.E.H.T.A. that condones hunting?

I'm going to level with you, $n. I've got a bar full of hungry murlocs that only eat three things: crabs, fish, and people.

If that's not reason enough, crabs are overpopulated in this region and they're decimating the local grub worm population!

How many innocent grub worms need to die before we do something, $n?</Description>
