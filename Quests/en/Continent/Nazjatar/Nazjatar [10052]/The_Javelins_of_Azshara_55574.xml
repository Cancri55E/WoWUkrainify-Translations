  <Title>The Javelins of Azshara</Title>
  <Description>These spirits keep speaking of the Javelins of Azshara. At first, I believed it to be referring to the handmaidens, who are currently holed up in Elun'alor.

But -- now I think they are referring to the Javelins of Suramar. They were powerful weapons -- long thought lost. Azshara does like to claim things as her own.

We need to defeat her handmaiden in Elun'alor regardless. Seizing the Javelins would be an amazing stroke of fortune.</Description>
