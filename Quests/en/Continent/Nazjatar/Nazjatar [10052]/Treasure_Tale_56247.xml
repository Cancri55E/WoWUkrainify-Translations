  <Title>Treasure Tale</Title>
  <Description>&lt;You discovered the history of Mardivas, a sorcerer that once lived in the city and the crafter of the arcane chests scattered around Nazjatar.

From the sounds of it, he was not well-liked, which worked out for him, as he did not much like others.

You also found and unlocked one of his "unsolvable" arcane locks. This knowledge may prove useful on your journey.

Artisan Itanu will surely enjoy hearing the end of this tale.&gt;</Description>
