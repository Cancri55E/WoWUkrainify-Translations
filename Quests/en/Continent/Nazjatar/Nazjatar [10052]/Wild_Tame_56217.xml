  <Title>Wild Tame</Title>
  <Description>In our time together, I have learned much. Both about my own abilities, and about your people. 

You are selfless in the face of challenge, much like our own. I consider us kin.

For some time, I have been training a snapdragon I found as a pup. He is a worthy mount, and I have been waiting for a worthy hunter to ride him. I believe I have found that hunter.

Here, he is yours.</Description>
