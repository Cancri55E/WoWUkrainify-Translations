  <Title>Beauty in the Deeps</Title>
  <Description>We have slain many enemies, spilled much blood on the sand. My skills have improved tenfold fighting at your side.

Yet let us not forget that once, this was a place of peace. Once, my people walked amongst the caverns and reefs undisturbed.

There is beauty, here, in the depths, all around us. Take a moment, sit, and enjoy your serene surroundings. Look here, a crab with a shell of brilliant colors.

You see? There is beauty here, even now.</Description>
