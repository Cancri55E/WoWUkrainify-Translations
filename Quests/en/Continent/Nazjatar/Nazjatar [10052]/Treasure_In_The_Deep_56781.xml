  <Title>Treasure In The Deep</Title>
  <Description>There are many treasures to be found throughout the naga stronghold of Nazjatar.

Some time ago, I noticed a mysterious looking chest. The area was heavily fortified with naga troops, so whatever it contains must be valuable.

We should go back and investigate the chest. Whatever is inside is better used in our hands than the hands of the enemy.</Description>
