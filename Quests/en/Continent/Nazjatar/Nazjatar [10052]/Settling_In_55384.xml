  <Title>Settling In</Title>
  <Description>Whatever Azshara is up to, this *ahem* great new landscape we have found ourself in is terribly inconvenient. 

Too many getting too close to our home. We have moved most of the refugees deeper into the cave.

Could you ask Telur to move our calling conch inside? 

Grab some of Slen's Elixir and check in with Vim.

Once it is set up, test it out! 

I'm off to do a progress check!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Set up the calling conch and make the rounds.</LogDescription>
