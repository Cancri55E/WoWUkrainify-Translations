  <Title>The Legend of Mechagon</Title>
  <Description>Heya, $p. I was just tellin' Skaggit that I was hoping I'd run into you up here!

I caught wind of an Alliance operation into some old vault that opened in Tiragarde Sound.

In typical gnomish fashion, Tinkmaster Overspark is overreacting like crazy, claiming it's some lost connection to the gnome fairytale land of Mechagon.

&lt;Gazlowe scoffs.&gt;

I don't buy that for a second, but I am very interested in getting my hands on whatever tech's in that vault. You in?</Description>
