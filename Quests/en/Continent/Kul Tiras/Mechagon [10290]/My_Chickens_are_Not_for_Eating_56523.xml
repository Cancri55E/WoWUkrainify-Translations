  <Title>My Chickens are Not for Eating!</Title>
  <Description>If you've spent any time with that arrogant nitwit, Overspark, you know why I'm here.

To silence his boasting and finally prove that my inventions are better!

I've released countless mechanical chickens across this island to analyze the technology here, adopt it, and evolve their own circuitry. One of them will become my ultimate battle chicken!

But those idiot troggs think my chickens are edible and keep bashing them.

Protect them, so my techno-evolutionary experiment can run its course.</Description>
