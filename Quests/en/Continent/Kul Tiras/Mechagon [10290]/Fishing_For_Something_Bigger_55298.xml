  <Title>Fishing For Something Bigger</Title>
  <Description>There's a huge fish lurking these waters, and it's been causing lots of problems! 

It eats other fish, fishermen, and a lot of expensive gear. I saw it swallow a beautiful Zigby 300 Fishing Rod along with its owner just the other day!

I've got a plan, but I've lost a lot of my equipment in the waters around here. Can you help fish up some of these items for me?</Description>
