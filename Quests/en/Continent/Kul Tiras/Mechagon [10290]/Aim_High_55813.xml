  <Description>This conspiracy of ravens is preying on citizens of Rustbolt, it's unacceptable! 

Prince Erazmin has asked me to reduce their numbers, but I could really use your help. Can you help me kill some of them? 

Use my marker gun if you need it. I'll blast the ones you mark, and help bring them down.</Description>
