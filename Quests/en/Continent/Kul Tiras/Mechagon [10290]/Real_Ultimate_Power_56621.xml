  <Title>Real Ultimate Power</Title>
  <Description>When I say that power is life, I'm not speaking figuratively, my dear test subject.

Properly harnessed, power can create life itself--or at least a close enough facsimile for our purposes.

There is a massive reserve of discarded technology lurking deep in the mucky depths of the Outflow. As usual, Mechagon's trash is our treasure.

I've finally perfected my device that will animate the sludge to bring that technology up to the surface for you.

All you have to do is pop 'em and grab the tech!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $2oa discarded technologies from techno-animated sludge.</LogDescription>
