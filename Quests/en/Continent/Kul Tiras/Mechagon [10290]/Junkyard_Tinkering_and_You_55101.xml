  <Description>Behold, the fabled Pascal Workshop of Rustbolt -- MY workshop!

Countless inventions have sprung forth into existence on this very spot, including my very finest invention, Pascal-K1N6!

Pascal-K1N6 can craft anything... as long as you have the blueprints for it.

And since I have you to thank for the K1N6's safe return to Rustbolt, would you like to learn how to access his blueprints database?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Pascal-K1N6 to craft a Scrap Grenade.</LogDescription>
