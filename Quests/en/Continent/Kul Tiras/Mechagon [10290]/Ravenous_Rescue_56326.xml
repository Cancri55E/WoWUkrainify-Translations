  <Title>Ravenous Rescue</Title>
  <Description>A conspiracy of ravens is preying on citizens of Rustbolt! It's most unacceptable! 

Prince Erazmin has asked me to rescue as many citizens as I can, but I could use your help. I've tracked the ravens to this hill. We blast the ravens out of the sky, and you rescue the mechagnomes.

Use my marker gun if you need help bringing the ravens down.</Description>
