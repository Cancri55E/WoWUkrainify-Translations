  <Description>I must share the wonders of this place with all of Azeroth in a way that will entertain young and old alike. I will use the technology here to create a new line of toys unlike anything seen before!

My Quasi-Faceted scanner can help construct perfect replicas of things here on the island. 

I just need a helpful individual such as yourself to scan a few things around this area.</Description>
