  <Title>Aid From Nordrassil</Title>
  <Description>Look at what they've done to this island, $n.

Nature is nearly extinguished, its death cry falling on the deaf ears of mechagnomes.

But I have heard the teeny tiny animals of Mechagon, and bring aid from afar!

It won't be easy to restore balance to a land so severely wounded. Nature's scars run deep here.

Thankfully, we are not alone. I've brought living sap from Nordrassil, the World Tree of Mount Hyjal. Use it to regrow the forests and speed nature's recovery in this land.</Description>
