  <Title>One Gnome's Trash</Title>
  <Description>The garbage in these trash heaps is full of rare metals: Dalaranium, Suramarite, even Gnomeisium! 

I've not seen this much easy gold to be had, since they left the vault door open in Boralus! You help me collect some of the metal, and my friend Gao will sell it on the black market.

I've got a device that can tear the metal right out of the trash!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa rare metals using the rare metal collector.</LogDescription>
