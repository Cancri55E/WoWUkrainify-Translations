  <Title>The Family Jewels</Title>
  <Description>Darn pirates stole my jewels... err, I mean my sister's... uh, mom's jewelry. Yeah, that's the story!

Point is, they stole it, and it's all out there strewn around in the mud, and treasure chests. Maybe on a few of the robots and murlocs.

My mom's not greedy, she just wants a few of the necklaces with gold and lots of diamonds. I'd pay ya for those.</Description>
