  <Title>Welcome to the Resistance</Title>
  <Description>Life in the Rustbolt Resistance is not easy, $n.

But it is yours. We will not order you around or force you to fight. Mechagon is a land of endless opportunities, and you may chase whichever opportunities you see fit.

Of course, if you'd like suggestions for which improvements you most require, myself or any of the other mechagnomes in town will be happy to advise you of your current weaknesses.

But, for now, I ask simply that you walk with me to my workshop.</Description>
