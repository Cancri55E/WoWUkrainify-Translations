  <Title>Knock His Bot Off</Title>
  <Description>I need to rebuild the main powercore. It's a 500S Mekronic so I'll need the operational schematics to get the work done. Only person I know who has a copy of that is Bondo Bigblock.

We're going to need Bondo's help to finish this. Maybe if you ask him, he'll lend us his schematics.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Acquire the powercore schematics from Bondo Bigblock.</LogDescription>
