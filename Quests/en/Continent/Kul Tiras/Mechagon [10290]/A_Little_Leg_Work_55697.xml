  <Title>A Little Leg Work</Title>
  <Description>The legs and shocks on this mount are shot! We'll need some new ones if we're going to get this mount crawling.
 
A few weeks ago, Bondo and his gang rode into the Scrapbone Den hoping to scare the Troggs off. The Troggs tore their crawlers apart! The parts for those crawlers are still laying all around Scrapbone Den.

See if you can get us some of those parts from the Troggs.</Description>
