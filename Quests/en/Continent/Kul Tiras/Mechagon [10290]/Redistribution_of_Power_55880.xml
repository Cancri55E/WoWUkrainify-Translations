  <Title>Redistribution of Power</Title>
  <Description>Welcome back, dear test subject.

Today's experiment is...

&lt;Pristy flips through some papers and smiles.&gt;

...My pet project, the NRG-100!

I am quite pleased with the potential improvements I've made to efficiency, potency, and destructivity.

And the only thing I had to sacrifice was stability!

When you're ready to proceed, strap on the NRG-100.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the NRG-100 to charge $2oa energy cells.</LogDescription>
