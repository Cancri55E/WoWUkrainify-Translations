  <Title>That New Mount Smell</Title>
  <Description>Once every week, Mechagon expels a lot of excess oils through the outflow. That's why the place is a toxic mess!

Today they expelled a batch of Golden Cogpaste. The stuff is amazing! I make air fresheners out of it. Makes any mount smell like it's brand new!

Check all the pipes in the outflow, and see if you can collect some of this paste.</Description>
