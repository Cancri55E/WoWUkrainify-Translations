  <Title>Rescuing the Resistance</Title>
  <Description>King Mechagon is ruthlessly efficient. He only expends resources to kidnap those he deems worthy.

The rest, he... discards.

&lt;Prince Erazmin grimaces.&gt;

We will deal with my father, King Mechagon, another day.

This information is more immediately relevant in that my father's predictability means our top scientists, engineers, and tinkerers should all be trapped, alive, somewhere in this depot.

We will find them, and break them out.</Description>
