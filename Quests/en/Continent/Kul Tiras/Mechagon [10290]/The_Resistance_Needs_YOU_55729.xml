  <Title>The Resistance Needs YOU!</Title>
  <Description>Rustbolt isn't usually in this level of malfunction.

King Mechagon attacked our town last night. His mechanical armies captured many members of the Rustbolt Resistance and destroyed as much as they could before we drove them out.

The prisoners are being processed at Junkwatt Depot. After that, they'll be transferred down into King Mechagon's underground city... for full mechanization.

We can't let that happen. Will you help me rescue them?</Description>
