  <Description>This runestone could be of Vrykul origins. Is it possible that Vrykul once visited this island? 

Where there's one runestone, there's usually more. The roots of lashers are drawn to the magic of runestones. If there are more buried here, the Lasher roots maybe wrapped around them!

Clear these lashers and see if any have runestones tangled in their roots.</Description>
