  <Title>Cogfrenzy's Construction Frenzy</Title>
  <Description>You Rustbolt resisters inspire me. Tinkering, building, exploring.

Letting your imagination run wild and then chasing after it, wherever it leads, with reckless abandon!

&lt;Walton releases a deep sigh.&gt;

I miss those days. I hope, someday, my conscience will allow me to stay on the surface with you all permanently...

Before I return to Mechagon, we must build something incredible.

Waren and I have identified a large number of extra construction project sites for today. 

Build with boldness!</Description>
