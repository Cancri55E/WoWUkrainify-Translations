  <Title>To Mechagon!</Title>
  <Description>Whatever's waiting for us on the shores of Mechagon, we're going to be ready for it with this crew.

I don't hold any misconceptions about how that crazy king is going to welcome us. Guns blazin', I'm sure.

When you're ready to go, talk to Captain Krooz.</Description>
