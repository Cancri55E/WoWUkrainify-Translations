  <Description>As a reward for all your help here, I was planning to fix this old mechaspider mount to give to you.

I could use some more of your help though to get this project started!

I'll need parts off a few of the bots nearby, and maybe you could talk to Cork Stuttgard at Bondo's Yard and see if you can get a Mechanobot Ignition system.</Description>
