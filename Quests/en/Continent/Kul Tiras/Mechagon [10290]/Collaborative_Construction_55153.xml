  <Title>Collaborative Construction</Title>
  <Description>Construction projects can be found all over the island. You'll be able to build some of 'em yourself, but you're gonna need help with the bigger projects.

Ask around and see what others are already working on, or just head out on your own and find a project you're interested in.

Construction projects move around and even change day-to-day, so keep an eye out for new ones while you're exploring.

If you're ever curious what construction projects are available on a given day, just ask me!</Description>
