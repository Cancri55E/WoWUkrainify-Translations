  <Description>The fabled workbench of Rustbolt - MY workbench - has fallen into disrepair!

This tragedy was no doubt caused by the same ruffians and miscreants who kidnapped me and Princess Wiggles.

The VERY same ruffians and miscreants, in fact, who still show their faces in this very town on the regular.

Their presence here is a veritable slap to our collective faces!

Dispatch the snatchers quickly and recover my binder of blueprints. We may then commence crafting what we shall need to repair this.</Description>
