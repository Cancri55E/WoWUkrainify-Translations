  <Title>More Power</Title>
  <Description>Welcome back, dear test subject.

My dear sister has kindly asked me to administer today's experiment, which falls below our typical standards of legality...

You may, as always, choose not to participate and we will acquire sufficient replacement test subjects.

Our new project requires more energy than our generator can manage. We must supercharge it with a jolt of power from the outside.

Bondo's Yard has the best power line in Mechagon, so we shall siphon what we need from those rapscallions.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Connect power lines from Bondo's Yard to the Quickcharge laboratory.</LogDescription>
