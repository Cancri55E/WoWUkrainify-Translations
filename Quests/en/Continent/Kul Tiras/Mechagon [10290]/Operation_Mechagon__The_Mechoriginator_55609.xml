  <Title>Operation: Mechagon - The Mechoriginator</Title>
  <Description>My father's madness won't be contained to this island.

King Mechagon is creating a massive device capable of reversing the Curse of Flesh across the entirety of Azeroth!

Any races forged by the Titans will return to their original state. For us gnomes, that means fully mechanical. For dwarves and troggs, stone. Vrykul, iron.

The list goes on, but most races aren't even ON the list. Anything not forged by the titans will be completely obliterated.

We must stop King Mechagon before it's too late!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Enter Mechagon and defeat King Mechagon.</LogDescription>
