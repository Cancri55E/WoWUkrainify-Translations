  <Title>The Other Place</Title>
  <Description>In my travels of the many possible futures, I discovered another place much like Rustbolt, but different.

In this other time and place, very little is alive, everything is machines.
 
You must travel to this other place. You will scan the memory banks of the Clockwork Giants you find there. Then we will use that data to ensure that our Rustbolt never becomes the other place.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Scan $2oa Clockwork Giants.</LogDescription>
