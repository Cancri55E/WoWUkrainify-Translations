  <Title>Cluckbox</Title>
  <Description>&lt;In the sparking, smoldering wreckage of Unit 35, you find a small, black cube.

It looks to be made of a metallic substance and appears unharmed.

Looking closely, you see a single word imprinted in the metal -- "Cluckbox."

This particular mechanical fowl was operating quite strangely. Someone in Rustbolt will probably want to investigate.&gt;</Description>
