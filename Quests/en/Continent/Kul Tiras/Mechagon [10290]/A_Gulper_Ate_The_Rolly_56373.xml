  <Title>A Gulper Ate The Rolly</Title>
  <Description>The Bubble-eyed Rolly used to be plentiful in the nearby pond.  Last week they all started to vanish!

A large water elemental has been swallowing all the fish! They are still alive, just swimming around inside the elemental now.

I need you to kill that elemental, and catch three Bubbly-eyed Rolly so I can examine their condition.</Description>
