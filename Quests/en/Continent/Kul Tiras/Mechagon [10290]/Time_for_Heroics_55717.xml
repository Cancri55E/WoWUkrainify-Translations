  <Description>That card you found was a gold rare Huolon! 

I think that card belonged to Adalin Halfheight, one of our junior explorer league members.  If he dropped it, he and our other junior members maybe in trouble!

We need to find Leona Mistcaller, Dunkin Crackjaw, and Adalin Halfheight immediately!</Description>
