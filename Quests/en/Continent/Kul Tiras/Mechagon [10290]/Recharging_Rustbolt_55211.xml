  <Title>Recharging Rustbolt</Title>
  <Description>Our personal generator is worthless until we recharge its empty energy cells.

As my dear brother says, energy cells are the lifeblood of innovation. Everything in Mechagon needs power, and energy cells deliver that power in a wonderfully universal format.

But, once they're drained of power, most people toss the empty cells away.

Most people are fools, dear test subject.

We have perfected the technology to recharge small numbers of energy cells back to full power.

Will you help us test it?</Description>
