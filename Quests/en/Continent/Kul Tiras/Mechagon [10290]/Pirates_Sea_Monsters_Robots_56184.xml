  <Description>I finally found it! This is the resting place of my father, after his crew mutinied and left him here to die.

I've scouted the island, and found the locations of three chests that contain mementoes of my father. 

Do this for me and my family. Recover my father's sword, clothing, and bones from the three chests I've marked.</Description>
