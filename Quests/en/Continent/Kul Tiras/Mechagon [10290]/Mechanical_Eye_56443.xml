  <Title>Mechanical Eye</Title>
  <Description>&lt;As the mechanical body of Unit 17 crumples into a heap, one eye lights up.

You hear a popping noise, and the eye flies from the head, aided by a small explosion.

You pick up the eye and notice it twitch a few times, then power down.

The citizens of Rustbolt seem to like junk, maybe they'll be interested in this.&gt;</Description>
