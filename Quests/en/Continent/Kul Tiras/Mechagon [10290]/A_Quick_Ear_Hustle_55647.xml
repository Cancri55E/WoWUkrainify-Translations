  <Title>A Quick Ear Hustle</Title>
  <Description>Bad news. We're late.

The Alliance was already crawling all over the vault when we got here.

Lucky for us, some big commotion inside sent some of 'em running for the hills.

Most of 'em are still down in that vault, though, including that crazy braggart Tinkmaster Overspark.

Let's give 'em a few more minutes to clear out, so we don't have to go in guns blazing.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wait for the Alliance to leave the vault.</LogDescription>
