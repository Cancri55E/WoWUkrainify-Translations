  <Title>Broken Unit 6</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Unit 6 sits here, nonfunctional following your attack.

There is something different and unsettling about this mechanical frog. It appeared to be mimicking frog behavior, but in a way that seemed wrong somehow.

None of the other mechanical frogs in the area behave similarly.

Instead of taking back only part of the unit for inspection, you pocket the entire frog. It's pretty small, after all.&gt;</Description>
