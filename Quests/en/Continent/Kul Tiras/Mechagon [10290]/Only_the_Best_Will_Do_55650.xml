  <Title>Only the Best Will Do</Title>
  <Description>You heard Gazlowe. The boss wants this expedition to go smoothly. No cutting corners, no slush.

I know you've worked with Gallywix in the past. We don't run our operations like that.

We expect the best from our crews, so we pay 'em what they're worth and treat 'em well. In return, we got the best goblin crews on the planet, and they ain't goin' over to any competition.

Here's a list of who and what we're gonna need to pull this off. Don't worry, Gazlowe'll cover all the costs.</Description>
