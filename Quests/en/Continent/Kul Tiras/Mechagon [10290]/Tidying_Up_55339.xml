  <Description>Ionized Minnows are a scourge of these waters. They strip the ocean floors of any food, making it difficult for other species to survive.

These fish have little to offer other than being a food source for larger fish. I want to see these larger fish, so I have a plan to clear the waters of these minnows and lure the bigger fish out from its hiding place.

Let's start by using my Minnow Vac to catch Ionized Minnows for me.</Description>
