  <Title>Go For The Gold</Title>
  <Description>I've heard lot's of stories about dead fathers, mothers, and family treasures. Don't believe any of it. We're all here to get any pirate gold, before these mecha-fools get it first! 

If there's gold to be had here, it's in that fat chest the murlocs are guarding.

Kill their chief, empty out the chest, and we'll split it fifty-fifty, since I'm telling ya about it.</Description>
