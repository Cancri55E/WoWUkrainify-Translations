  <Description>&lt;Gazlowe pulls you in close and whispers.&gt;

Lookit here, $n. I gotta keep my nose clean here in front of the prince.

But I trust you know what's gotta be done outside of town, yeah?

Outside of town... where all the tech is...

Tech that Alliance grubs are tryin' to get their clumsy mitts on...
which we could use for the Horde...
to build big weapons...
and scary robots...
and other lucrative products...?

I don't gotta spell this out for you, right?</Description>
