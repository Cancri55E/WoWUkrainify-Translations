  <Title>My Punkin, the Action Figure</Title>
  <Description>Heya, $n.

&lt;Grizzek leans in close and whispers.&gt;

I'm workin' on a surprise for Saffy. Hopin' you can help me out.

I overheard her beggin' Jepetto Joybuzz to make her into one of his fancy new action figures.

That ol' jerk told her no. Can you believe it? My Punkin!

Well, we don't need him. I reverse engineered a few of his toys and found out what makes them tick.

I got a blueprint ready to go. We can make Saffy's action figure ourselves and surprise her with it!</Description>
