  <Title>Send My Father a Message</Title>
  <Description>My people are once again safe... for now.

King Mechagon won't stop sending his armies at us as long as he does not fear us.

We must send him a message.

Climb to the top of the ramparts, and hack one of my father's projectors to proudly shine the banner of the Rustbolt Resistance big enough for the whole island to see.

I'm sure that'll attract the attention of my father, King Mechagon.</Description>
