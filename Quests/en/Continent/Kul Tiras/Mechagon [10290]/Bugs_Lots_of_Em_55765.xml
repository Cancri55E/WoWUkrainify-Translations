  <Title>Bugs, Lots of 'Em!</Title>
  <Description>You got a problem with mechanical bugs, so the Roughriders are here to sort this mess out!

In my experience, this big of an outbreak must have some sort of queen bug behind it all. We gonna go in, kill a lot of bugs till we find the leader of 'em all.

Horde or Alliance don't matter, you're with the Roughriders today. Let's kill some bugs!</Description>
