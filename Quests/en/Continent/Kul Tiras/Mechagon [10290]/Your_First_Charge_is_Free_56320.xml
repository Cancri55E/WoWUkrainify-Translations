  <Title>Your First Charge is Free!</Title>
  <Description>Do you feel the energy rippling through the ground here, my dear test subject?

&lt;Flip inhales deeply.&gt;

Without that constant bristle of electricity, nothing of any meaning would exist.

My dear sister and I have tapped into a high-voltage power line buried here, but the real juice is over in Bondo's Yard. He selfishly hoards access to the heftiest power line in Mechagon!

If you want to recharge your empty energy cells, you're going to have to get access to the Charging Station from Flux.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gain access to the Charging Station in Bondo's Yard, then use it to charge an Empty Energy Cell.</LogDescription>
