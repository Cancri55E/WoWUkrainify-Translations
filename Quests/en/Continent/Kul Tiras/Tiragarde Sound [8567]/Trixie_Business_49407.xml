  <Title>Trixie Business</Title>
  <Description>Usually this is the part where I hand you the scroll and send you on your way.

Sadly, friend, these are unusual times.

How's a man expected to run an honest business dealing in highly illegal goods when the Irontide Raiders are shaking down good folk like myself?

I'm prepared to offer you a handsome sum - and the scroll for our shelled associate - if you rid me of the damnable woman who collects these tributes.

You'll surely find her at Harlan's table at the bar, getting drunk on MY gold!</Description>
