  <Title>A Letter to the League</Title>
  <Description>A researcher at the Resort up the hill was hoping to get a letter out to a group called the "Explorers' League". He claims that they have a camp set up near some old Drust ruins on the other side of the sound.

There's no official station so it will have to be delivered by hand. If you happen to head in that direction, can you take it with you?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find the Explorers' League members at the Thovas Base-Camp.</LogDescription>
