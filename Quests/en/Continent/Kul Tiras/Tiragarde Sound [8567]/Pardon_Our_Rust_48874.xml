  <Title>Pardon Our Rust</Title>
  <Description>The traps we've set up in the field require routine maintenance checks. Some of them are fairly old and will spring at incorrect times. If only we could get more funding for these sort of supplies. $b$b&lt;The huntmistress glances towards Lord Kennings.&gt;$b$bWhile you're out hunting, could you reset any sprung ones that you find?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Arm $1oa Bear Traps.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Be careful when resetting the traps, and if you get injured by faulty equipment, take it up with Kennings, not me.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It seems that you still have all of your limbs attached, and here I was hoping that I could talk Kennings into buying us new traps. Fair work.</RewardText>
