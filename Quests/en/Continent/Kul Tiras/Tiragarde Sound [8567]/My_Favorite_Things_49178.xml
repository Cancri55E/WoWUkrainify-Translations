  <Description>It's tough out here.

Pirates. Deadly monsters. 

Hungry Sam's seemingly endless battle with indigestion.

Nothing sets the nerves at ease like an old keepsake. Somethin' to remind you of home. Somethin' to keep you going.

Ask around the camp. Find out what folks might have lost out there in the tideways. If you can bring any of it back, it'd be a mighty kind gesture.

Me? Oh... I had a locket... 

Never mind, it's too small, you'd never find it. It's nothing. Don't worry about it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ask Friendly Pete, Hungry Sam and Handy Bill about their missing keepsakes, then collect those items from the Wailing Tideway.</LogDescription>
