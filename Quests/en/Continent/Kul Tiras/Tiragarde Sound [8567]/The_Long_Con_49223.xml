  <Title>The Long Con</Title>
  <Description>Hello again my young friend! I have good news.

Our mutual acquaintance Carentan -- the man who scammed us in Freehold -- has finally come out of hiding.

I have been communicating with him in letters delivered by various middlemen and even completed a few proxy trades to earn his trust. In our last correspondence, he agreed to meet for an in-person trade.

He thinks he is meeting with a Ms. Pixy Spindlespark, gnomish hairdresser with a weakness for poached furs.

But he'll be meeting you instead.</Description>
