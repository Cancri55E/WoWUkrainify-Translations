  <Title>Targeting a Turncoat</Title>
  <Description>The instigator of this mutiny is a man named Fernn. He has always shown discontent with House Proudmoore and his position here. But to betray the men he works with? That seems beyond even my expectations of him.

Take him out, and show this mutiny the mistake of crossing truly loyal marines.</Description>
