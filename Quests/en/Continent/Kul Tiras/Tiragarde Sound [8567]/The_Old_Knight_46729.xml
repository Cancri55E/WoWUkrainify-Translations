  <Title>The Old Knight</Title>
  <Description>These days Cyrus is the Harbormaster, but he used to be one of Daelin Proudmoore's most trusted knights!

I lost my mother when the Scourge hit Lordaeron. My father sent me here to be raised away from the war. I don't know much about him... just that he was a Stormwind knight who gave his life fighting the Lich King.

Daelin hand-picked Cyrus to raise me and forced him to take a desk job. It's the only reason he wasn't at Theramore.

He's probably checking in that other Alliance ship. Let's go!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet with Cyrus Crestfall.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Sorry, I should have mentioned he can be a bit... long-winded at times.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I've never seen Cyrus fired up like this!

Sounds like we have work to do.</RewardText>
