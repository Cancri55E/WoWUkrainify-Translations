  <Title>Encase of Emergency</Title>
  <Description>The cliffs here are well known for the crystal clear ice which forms at their base, and even more so for the elementals that are responsible for such. The hunters in my lodge use shards from the primal bodies to keep their stock frozen for transport. $b$bMore importantly, think of how useful it could be for making and serving drinks!$b$bLet's see if we can't find some elementals and gather shards from them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Pristine Ice Chunks from ice elementals.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I've heard that destroying some of the larger ice structures in the area angers them, so do what you do best and destroy any that you come across!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Perfectly chilled drinks, here I come! And there is enough for the hunters here too.</RewardText>
