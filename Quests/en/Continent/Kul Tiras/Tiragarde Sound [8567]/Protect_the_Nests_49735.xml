  <Title>Protect the Nests</Title>
  <Description>Now that Tagart is done with your hazing... I mean... trials, you can start helping us with some of the work around here.

Some of the nearby gryphon nests have been overrun with saurolisk. I fear that the gryphons will make new roosts elsewhere if we don't clear them out.

Head up the road towards the waterfall and take out those saurolisks. Report to Shawn when you're done. He's posted as a lookout there.</Description>
