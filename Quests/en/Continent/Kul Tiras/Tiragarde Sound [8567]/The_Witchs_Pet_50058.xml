  <Title>The Witch's Pet</Title>
  <Description>I've seen her! The witch!

Every once in a while she comes down to the cave, checking on her pet. I've never seen a spider so large!

She spreads her spell, cursing all of the animals in these woods to follow her command and attack us.

The broodmother laid all these eggs, and they're hatching into more possessed beasts!

Take her out, and perhaps the infestation will stop.</Description>
