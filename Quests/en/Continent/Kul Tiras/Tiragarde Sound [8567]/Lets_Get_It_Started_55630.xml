  <Title>Let's Get It Started</Title>
  <Description>Those gnomes think busting up machinery is gonna stop a goblin like me from figuring out what all the tech in this place does?

I ain't never seen a hunk of junk so busted up that ol' Skaggit and I can't get running smoother than the day it was made.

Tell ya what. You head around with Skaggit and see what you can piece back together.

Meanwhile, I'll have a chat with our gnome friend here and see what she knows about all this tech.</Description>
