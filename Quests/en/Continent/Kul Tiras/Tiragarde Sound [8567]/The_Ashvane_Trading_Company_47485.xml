  <Title>The Ashvane Trading Company</Title>
  <Description>So, Ashvane's goons are walking around with a new powder that can blow a galleon clean in half and the military has no idea.

We need to find out how much of this powder they have and where it's going.

An old buddy of mine works the ferry down by the Ashvane Foundry. He may know something about this.

You can take the ferry from Tradewinds Market to Eastpoint Station. Once you get there, look for a man named Cagney. Tell him I sent you. He owes me a favor.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Cagney at Eastpoint Station. Take the ferry from Will Melborne in Tradewinds Market.</LogDescription>
