  <Description>Lookin' for a friend from the wreck, eh?

If he survived he may have wandered up the path to our camp.

Now if he ain't up there toastin' his buns by the fire, well... lotta poor souls fall victim to the song of the sirens. 

You should check the camp before you go wadin' out into the tideway. Ask our leader, Stabby Jane. She'd know for sure if a new survivor showed up!</Description>
