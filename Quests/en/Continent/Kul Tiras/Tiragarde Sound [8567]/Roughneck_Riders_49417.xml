  <Title>Roughneck Riders</Title>
  <Description>Rulf sent word that you're needed for another job.

A rich house cat is willing to pay top dollar for a male aerie alpha and there is only one that fits the bill, Greatfeather. I gotta head back to camp to help train a particularly wild female, so this is going to be a solo job.

Find Greatfeather and hit him with the Tether Shot. From there, you'll have to wing it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Capture Greatfeather.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I can't believe you did it, kid! I knew you'd be Roughneck material!</RewardText>
