  <Title>Stinging Barbs</Title>
  <Description>The Outrigger hunters exhibit the pinnacle of Kul Tiran brawn. But they would indubitably be unable to succeed in taking down the most impressive of their prey without my own inventions!

I present to you, the most ordinary of harpoons. However, with just a tad of gnomish ingenuity, this average weapon can become so much more!
