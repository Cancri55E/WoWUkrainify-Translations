  <Description>I'm STARVING.

Not actually starving, like when I first got here, but you know... Emotionally starving.

Haven't had any luck with the oysters lately, and seaweed soup really upsets my guts. If I eat any more of that stuff, I think the other castaways might actually feed me to the sharks.

How about them tidelurkers? They look pretty juicy. Bet you could steam those up real nice.

Can you get me some? I'm not much of a hunter. But I'll share it with you!</Description>
