  <Title>Rig Robbing</Title>
  <Description>I'm out here tryin' to enjoy my break, but I ran outta hooch.

Got some grog hidden in the water just off the dock, stashed in a crate tied up to some of the rigging. 

Do me a favor and fetch it, will ya? Rigging's pretty tangled so you might have to pull in a few lines before you get the right one.

I'd do it myself, but if they see me they're gonna force me back to work unloadin' them new weapons.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Tangled Rigging to collect the "Sea Dog" Grog.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You get my stash?</CompletionText>
