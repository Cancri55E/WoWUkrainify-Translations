  <Description>It looks like you understand the basics. Now it's time to put everything together.

Head for the ring. Once you hear the starting pistol, you will have one minute to score as high as possible.

Gnolls are worth one point. Run 'em through with the harpoon!

If you see a paper zeppelin, bag it with your bolas for fifty points!

Leaping fences gives you style. Style gives you more points when you skewer gnolls or down zeppelins. It's super important, so don't forget to keep jumping fences!</Description>
