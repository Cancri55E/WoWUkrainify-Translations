  <Title>The Castaways</Title>
  <Description>I see the sirens have made another catch. You're lucky they haven't stripped your bones yet.

If you need to trade supplies or just warm yourself by the fire, there's a camp up the hill behind me.

Everyone there washed up in the tides, just like you. Figure we've got folks from at least four or five shipwrecks now. All banded together, just tryin' to survive.

Talk to Stabby Jane. Don't worry about her nickname, she's actually real nice.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Stabby Jane at Castaway Point.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ah, you must be from the latest wreck. Those damn sirens are getting bolder by the day.</RewardText>
