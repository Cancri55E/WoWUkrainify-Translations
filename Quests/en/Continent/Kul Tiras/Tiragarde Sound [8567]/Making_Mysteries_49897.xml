  <Title>Making Mysteries</Title>
  <Description>Do you know what people love? The unexplained! Problem is, everything here is explainable. 

So I have a plan to create our own phe-gnome-enon. There are stories that talk about some weird chicken-snake hybrids that can turn you to stone. I've already released the chickens, now we just need the snakes.

The first problem can be solved easily. Just chase down the chickens, and stick one of these robotic tails on them.</Description>
