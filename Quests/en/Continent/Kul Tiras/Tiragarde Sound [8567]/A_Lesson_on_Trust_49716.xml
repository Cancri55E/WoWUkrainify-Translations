  <Title>A Lesson on Trust</Title>
  <Description>The men in the fort were once under my command, and so, they are now my responsibility. Each of them should have a badge we use for identifying individuals under certain circumstances. I would ask you to bring back a number of these as proof of thinning their ranks.

These men are no longer soldiers of Boralus, and as such, no longer deserve to carry the Proudmoore anchor.</Description>
