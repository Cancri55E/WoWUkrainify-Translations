  <Title>Farmers Who Fight</Title>
  <Description>I was hoping for a squad of Proudmoore Academy's finest, but I guess you'll have to do.

What we lack in manpower we make up for in courage! Even the farmers here won't give up their land without a fight.

Send the bravest of them to me. They will fight better alongside our marines than by themselves out in the fields!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recruit 6 Vigil Hill Farmers into the militia.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We need anyone willing and able to fight!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We'll get those volunteers paired up with the regulars and give 'em a fighting chance.</RewardText>
