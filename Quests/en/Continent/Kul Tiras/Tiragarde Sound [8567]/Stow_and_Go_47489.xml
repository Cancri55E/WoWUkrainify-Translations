  <Description>&lt;Flynn lifts his collar to hide his face and speaks to you under his breath.&gt;

You see that ship? I know that ship.

Let's just say her captain and I have a little history.

It's a smuggling vessel. Our illegal weapons are on there for sure. I'd bet my coat on it... and I love this coat.

We need to find out where it's going...

How are you in tight spaces?</Description>
