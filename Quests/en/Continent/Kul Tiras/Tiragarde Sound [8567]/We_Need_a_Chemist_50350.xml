  <Title>We Need a Chemist</Title>
  <Description>All this chaos started when we were picking at a large Azerite node deep in the mine. The mine began to rumble and all of these blasted creatures burst from the ground. If we could just get rid of that vein, I am sure we could retake the mine.

First, we need a chemist. The best one we got is in his lab across the river. Find him and he'll give you more instructions.</Description>
