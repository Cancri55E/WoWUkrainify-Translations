  <Title>A Boralus Triple Threat</Title>
  <Description>If Tallis honestly thinks that offing a few random soldiers is going to force us to give up Southwatch, he's in for a surprise. The reason why we haven't chased out the sorry troops in this camp is simply because we have more pressing plans.

Fernn has his lieutenants facing the Watch's cannons straight at Boralus as we speak. Those three are the real driving force of the attack.

&lt;The marine gives you a concerned look as he realizes what he said.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take out Fernn's three lieutenants.</LogDescription>
