  <Title>Inspection Gadget</Title>
  <Description>Some time ago, a good friend of mine who had a tinker shop in Boralus just stopped all correspondence. With the state of foreign affairs, I wasn't able to look for him myself until recently.

It's not just him. It seems that all of the gnomes that were living in the city just up and vanished.

I've decided to start my search with these ruins, but the machines here have gone haywire. Could you go get a good magnetic reading on the place?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Survey the Rusted Vault.</LogDescription>
