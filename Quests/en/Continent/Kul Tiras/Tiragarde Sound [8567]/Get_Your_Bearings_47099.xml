  <Title>Get Your Bearings</Title>
  <Description>I think a proper introduction is in order!

My name is Taelia, member of the Proudmoore Guard and squire of Sir Cyrus Crestfall.

&lt;Taelia salutes firmly.&gt;

Cyrus asked me and Flynn to break you out of that Ashvane prison and get you settled in here at the market, but he neglected to mention that you're with the Alliance.

I must say, it's an honor.

Let's get you up to speed.</Description>
