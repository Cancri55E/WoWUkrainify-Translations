  <Title>WANTED: Raging Earthguard</Title>
  <Description>I have been receiving formal complaints about some big earth elemental in the middle of our scouting path.

Normally I'd elect to ignore these, but the sooner we get done here, the better. Nobody wants to be stuck in this frozen hill any longer than we need to.

Payment goes to the person who brings it down!</Description>
