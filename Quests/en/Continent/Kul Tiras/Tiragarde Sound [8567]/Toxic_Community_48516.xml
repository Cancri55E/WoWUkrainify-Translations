  <Description>A traveler? Nobody uses this trail unless they got a death wish.

The only thing more poisonous than the marrowflies are the saurolisks that eat 'em all day.

That marrowfly toxin is what I'm here for. Y'see, I'm a purveyor of, uh... specialty goods. And my clients are just dyin' for more of my product. Heh.
