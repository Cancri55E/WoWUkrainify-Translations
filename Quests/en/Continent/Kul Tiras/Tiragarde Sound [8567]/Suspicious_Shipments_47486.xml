  <Title>Suspicious Shipments</Title>
  <Description>Normally I wouldn't tell you nothin'... but I'll spill it for Cyrus.

Ashvane's onto somethin' big.

They got guys workin' round the clock in there. Even brought in some muscle to keep everyone uh... "motivated."

I don't know anything about what they're makin', but I know it ain't passin' through here to Boralus.

If I were dumb enough to go snooping around in there, I'd look at the goods themselves. See if they got shipping labels.

But I ain't that dumb, so you gotta do it.</Description>
