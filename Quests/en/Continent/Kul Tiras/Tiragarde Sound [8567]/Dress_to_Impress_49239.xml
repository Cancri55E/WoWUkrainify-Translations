  <Title>Dress to Impress</Title>
  <Description>Freehold used to be open to anyone, but now it seems the Irontide Raiders have declared themselves the owners. They're locking the place down and turning away anyone who isn't part of the crew.

Fortunately, they're also hiring.

Put this on. Don't think about where it came from.

We'll pose as new recruits, get in, gather some information, and be back in Boralus in time for supper! Cyrus may be salty, but he's a decent cook.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Put on the Irontide Hat and enter Freehold with Flynn.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Don't worry, Venrik's a good man. I trust him with my life.</RewardText>
