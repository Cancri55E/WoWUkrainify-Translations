  <Description>Let me tell you a thing about my employees.

They're always blowing things out of proportion! I give them a good job with a steady wage and what do they do? They try to make excuses as to why they can't work!

They say the trees have come alive. Trees? Walking and fighting? If you're going to lie, at least make it more believable.

If they want to convince me, I'm going to need cold hard proof.</Description>
