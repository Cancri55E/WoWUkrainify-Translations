  <Title>Pinch of Azerite</Title>
  <Description>I don't have time for idle chit chat! If you haven't noticed, rocks are running around doing who knows what?!

How about you help out and retrieve my chemistry kit. While you're out, smash some of those creatures and collect their dust. Prim will need both of those for the next step of the plan.

Maybe we can figure out what has animated the Azerite.</Description>
