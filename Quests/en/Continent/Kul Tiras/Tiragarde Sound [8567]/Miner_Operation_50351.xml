  <Title>Miner Operation</Title>
  <Description>The mine is in real trouble. We've been excavating for a short while, but never seen anything like this. Azerite doesn't just get up and walk around.

If we are going to take the mine back, we're going to need more help. We'll need an engineer and an explosives expert. I have two in mind, sisters actually, but they are caught behind the river in all the chaos.

Locate the sisters and they'll help you with the next phase of the plan.</Description>
