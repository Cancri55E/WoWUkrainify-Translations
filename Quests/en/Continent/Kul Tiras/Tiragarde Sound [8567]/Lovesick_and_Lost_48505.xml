  <Title>Lovesick and Lost</Title>
  <Description>Ugh. My head. My HEART.

Feels like a good hangover and a bad breakup put together.

On the bright side, I think I know where we are. And where that ship was headed.

Freehold.

It's a... free town. For, uh... free folk. The only rule is that there are no rules. Lotta guys with peg legs and eye patches and exotic pets. Catch my drift?

There's a trail through the hills that'll take us there. Pretty sure I remember the way...

Let's get moving. Gotta walk off that damn siren's witchery.</Description>
