  <Title>Rock Meet Dynamite</Title>
  <Description>Thanks for your help out there, but we have to ask another favor from you.

These elementals must be coming from somewhere in the mine and we need you to locate that source. 

You seem more than capable of handling yourself in there, but just for extra security I am going to send you with some of Prim's special dynamite. It has an extra kick from the Azerite dust that you gathered.

Get in. Find the source. Put a stop to these elementals.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Eliminate the source of the Azerite creatures.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>A trogg? Hmmm... He may have eaten quite a bit of Azerite to be able to cause all this.

With him gone, now we can clear out the remaining creatures here and get back to digging! Thank you for your help.</RewardText>
