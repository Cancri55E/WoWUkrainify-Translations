  <Title>The Castaways</Title>
  <Description>You don't look like you're from around here. You're lucky the sirens haven't stripped your bones yet.

If you need to trade supplies or just warm yourself by the fire, there's a camp up the hill behind me.

Everyone there washed up in the tides. Figure we've got folks from at least four or five shipwrecks now. All banded together, just tryin' to survive.

Talk to Stabby Jane. Don't worry about her nickname, she's actually real nice.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Stabby Jane at Castaway Point.</LogDescription>
