  <Title>She Sells Seashells</Title>
  <Description>Papa wanted to go fishing, and mum is working, so he brought me along.

But I'm bored! I'm trying to sell some of the shells I found washed up on the beach, but nobody seems to be stopping. I don't think my shells are pretty enough...

You don't seem like you're afraid of those big snakes on the beach. Can you bring me back some prettier shells? Only the shiniest please!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather shells for Jenny.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Come, let us parley... How was that? I'm trying to sound like a proper shell seller.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Oooh! These are so pretty! I bet they'll sell really well.</RewardText>
