  <Title>The Bears and the Bees</Title>
  <Description>Hey, while you're out, would you grab some honey for me and the boys?

Plenty of hives out in the woods, but I'd be careful if you don't want to dirty your delicate house cat hands. Bears out here tend to get pretty vicious when they smell honey.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $2oa Scruffhide Bears and gather $1oa Sticky Bee Honey from nearby Beehives.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Bears giving you trouble?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You got more on your shirt than you got in the bottles! I'd ask you to shower, but frankly none of us have done that in weeks.</RewardText>
