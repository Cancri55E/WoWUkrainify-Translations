  <Title>Big Boss</Title>
  <Description>With a performance like that, it's clear you're one of the top dogs here. Boss Tak will want to see you. He's up north checking on one of our camps in Waning Glacier. Head up that way and give him a hand.

Oh, and I don't recommend looking him straight in the eye... or at his feet... or really anywhere near him. Best bet, close your eyes when you're talkin' to him.</Description>
