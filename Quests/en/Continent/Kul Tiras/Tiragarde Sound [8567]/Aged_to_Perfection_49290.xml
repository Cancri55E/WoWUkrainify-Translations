  <Title>Aged to Perfection</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, young one. I am Roko. I trade in specialty goods and exotic wares.

&lt;Roko pulls a small wooden cask from beneath his shell.&gt;

This bourbon is one hundred years old. I know, because I bought it one hundred years ago.

A man in Freehold is prepared to trade me a rare scroll for this, but alas I am barred from entering. It seems this town is not so "free" anymore.

If you can get in, perhaps you could make the trade on my behalf? I would be in your debt.</Description>
