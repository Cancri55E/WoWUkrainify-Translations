  <Title>Drust in Time</Title>
  <Description>A few days ago, a band of Alliance researchers that called themselves the "Explorers' League" took a contingent of Kul Tiran soldiers to the old Drust ruins down the road.

We haven't really heard from them since, and I'm growing a bit concerned. I can't leave my post, so can you check up on the team?</Description>
