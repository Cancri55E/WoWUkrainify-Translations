  <Title>Out Like Flynn</Title>
  <Description>I'm relieved you woke up! Having to carry you would have made this job far less appealing.

The name's Flynn, and my client in Boralus is paying me a king's bounty to break you out of here.

You, my friend, are incarcerated in Tol Dagor. Used to be a legit prison... 'til the Ashvane Trading Company bought it. Now it's Priscilla's own personal fortress, riddled with scum on both sides of the bars.

Wasn't hard to bribe my way into this cell. Now we just have to get out.

Not to worry. I have a plan!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Escape Tol Dagor with Flynn.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is that the new powder Flynn was talking about?

I'll take it for safekeeping.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It's hard to believe the Lord Admiral would willingly hand you and her daughter over to Lady Ashvane.

She must have had her reasons... right?</RewardText>
