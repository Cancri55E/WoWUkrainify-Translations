  <Title>Fairwind's "Friends"</Title>
  <Description>Someone must have recognized Flynn and ratted him out! A bunch of Irontide thugs dragged him off to the Ring of Booty for a "special audience" with Captain Harlan Sweete.

Flynn doesn't like to talk about this, but he used to captain his own crew. With Harlan as his First Mate.

The two had a falling out after a messy job and Flynn lost all taste for freebooting. Just disappeared one day.

Harlan took the nastiest of the crew and formed the Irontide Raiders.

In other words; it's personal.</Description>
