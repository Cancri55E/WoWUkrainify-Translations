  <Title>Glimmering Locket</Title>
  <Description>&lt;A glint of metal catches your eye among the gently bobbing flotsam. Digging into the tangled seaweed, you discover a locket of simple, yet sturdy design.

Opening the locket reveals a hand-drawn picture of a woman with fiery red bangs. 

Her arm is around a woman with short-cropped auburn hair, and the two are proudly displaying warm smiles for the artist.&gt;</Description>
