  <Title>Inventory Deficit</Title>
  <Description>My employees say we're under attack. They say our workers are falling to beasts and men made of wood.

I say we're losing precious inventory!

Do you know how many company-issued axes must be getting dropped out there? That's a waste of my hard-earned money!

I'm going to need you to get those back for me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Reclaimed Axes from dead Algerson Lumberjacks.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I spend my own money to get these workers the supplies they need and they just go ahead and lose them! How much more generous must I be?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Perhaps the cost of the axes should come out of their paychecks from now on!</RewardText>
