  <Title>The Legend of Mechagon</Title>
  <Description>I came as soon as I heard!  A mysterious vault has been discovered in Tiragarde. 

Centuries ago, the last king of the gnomes, King Mechagon, led his followers in search of a mythical land of technology. He left no clue as to where he was headed, and over time his legend faded into history. This vault could be the first step to discovering King Mechagon's true fate! 

I must examine it firsthand. Meet me there, Champion. I could use your assistance.</Description>
