  <Title>Trouble at Greystone Keep</Title>
  <Description>A friend of mine, a fellow military courier, had a job at Greystone Keep. The fort lies just outside of Boralus, so I would've expected him to be back by now.

I have another job lined up, so could you go check out the fort for me? I'm probably just being paranoid.</Description>
