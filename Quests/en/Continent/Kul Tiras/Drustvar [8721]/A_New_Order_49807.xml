  <Title>A New Order</Title>
  <Description>Before we leave, I have one more task to ask of you.

While you were busy recruiting our inquisitors and driving the coven away from Arom's Stand, I took the liberty of placing an order with the local tailor. 

Using some of the sketches within the tome, I had him put together some uniforms reminiscent of those worn by the ancient order.

Since you will be leading our inquisitors, I think it's only fitting that you present them with their new regalia.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Give the Inquisitors Regalia to the recruits in Arom's Stand.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You should be inducting them, not me!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There, that was nice and official. 

Now, I think it's time we took the fight back to the Heartsbane. I believe the marshal has a plan.</RewardText>
