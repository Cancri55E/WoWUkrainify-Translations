  <Description>Hey you! I got a business proposition for ya.The locals here seem to have a thing for silver, and we hit the jackpot with a mine just west of here. 

Unfortunately, it's got a bit of a spider problem...

Now, the miners we sent down there are probably goners by now, but there's still some silver left down there. If you can go and fetch it for me, we'll mark it up and make a fortune!

What do you say?</Description>
