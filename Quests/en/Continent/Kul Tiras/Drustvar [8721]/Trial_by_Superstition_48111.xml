  <Title>Trial by Superstition</Title>
  <Description>Witchcraft has long lived in the superstitions of the people here. It is only recently that some of these superstitions have become reality.

According to tradition, one who is tried for witchcraft is allowed to choose the means by which they are tested from among the requests of her peers.

The villagers here no doubt have some strange beliefs of what witches can and cannot do. Speak with them, and see what we can do to prove my innocence.</Description>

Looks like that leaves us with three tests...</RewardText>
