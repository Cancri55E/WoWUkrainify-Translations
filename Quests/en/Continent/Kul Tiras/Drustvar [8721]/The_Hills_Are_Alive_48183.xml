  <Title>The Hills Are Alive</Title>
  <Description>The Drust constructs are drawn from the land, but the heart of these constructs is a runic power core. 

We have been trying to collect and destroy as many of these cores as we can. We know of a way to disrupt the magic in the core. Doing so will prevent more of these monstrosities from being created around the dark hearts and protect the land and all living in this region.

Bring me as many Runic Power Cores as you can find and the Thornspeakers will see they are put to good use.</Description>
