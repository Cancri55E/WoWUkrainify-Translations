  <Title>The Order of Embers</Title>
  <Description>The Order of Embers was the name given to those who took up these arms against the Drust. Using the tools and methods uncovered by the scholars, they were able to counter the Drust's magic, and ensure our victory in the war.

If the coven wants to use the Drust's magic against us, then we'll use the order's weapons against them.

The knowledge of the order rests here, but without a hand to wield it, it will do us no good. 

Will you be that hand, $c? Will you revive the Order of Embers?</Description>

  <RewardText>You do great honor to my family, $c.  The most noble of Waycrests were once inquisitors of the order.

It is only fitting that it is you who takes up its mantle now.</RewardText>
