  <Title>Running Late</Title>
  <Description>I beg your pardon, but I am a little concerned at Lord Waycrest's tardiness.

I'd hate to be a bother, but would you mind checking on him? The ceremony awaits his presence.

You can find him in the bride's room, at the top of the tower.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Lord Arthur Waycrest in Whitegrove Chapel.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It must be around here somewhere...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Splendid! I'll just need to take a few moments to go over this and I'll be right down.

Please let Lucy and Alexander know I will be ready shortly.</RewardText>
