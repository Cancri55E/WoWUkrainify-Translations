  <Title>Clear-Cutting</Title>
  <Description>We've managed to hold this hill, but the wicker creatures have moved in to surround us.   

We're not going to be able to move into the town if we don't get them off our flanks. This is where you come in, $c.

See if you can clear out some of their numbers in the lumber fields. That way, when we move in, we only need to worry about one front.</Description>
