  <Title>Once Bitten, Twice Shy</Title>
  <Description>I am all too familiar with the bloodfly's bite. We had them all over the fields surrounding Waycrest Manor.

Though I'm loath to subject myself to them on purpose, if it will help convince these people, I am willing to deal with that nuisance. 

Find a jar and collect as many bloodflies as you can. They are common in these parts, and shouldn't be hard to find.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find an Empty Jar and use it to catch 6 Hovering Bloodflies near Hangman's Point.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to catch enough bloodflies?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done. $B$BWith this many bloodflies at least one is bound to bite.</RewardText>
