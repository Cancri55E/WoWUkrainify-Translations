  <Description>Thanks heaps for getting us out of that pickle, mainlander. I'd hate to ask, but would you be willing to help with another matter?

Even before this curse struck the village, our sausage shipments from Carver's Harbor started slowing down. If we don't get them sausages, I won't be able to feed my family!

Can you help an honest sausage merchant out? Carver's Harbor is just down the road from here.</Description>
