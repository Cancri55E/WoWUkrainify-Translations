  <Title>Save Their Bacon</Title>
  <Description>This is going to sound strange, $c, but some of my workers were turned into pigs! Lucky I was out on an errand, or I'd have been caught too! Now my people are tied up awaiting... processing. 

&lt;Thomas suppresses the urge to retch.&gt;

I can't get past those monsters, but you look like the sort who could. Not sure if this helps, but I coulda sworn I heard some wild cackling coming from the warehouse.

Please... save my people!</Description>
