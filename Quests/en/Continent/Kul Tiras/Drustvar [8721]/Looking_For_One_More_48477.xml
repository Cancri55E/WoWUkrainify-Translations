  <Title>Looking For One More</Title>
  <Description>Our loathsome foe, 'Sister' Westwood, yet continues her work. After subjugating myself, she set her malicious sights on my companion, fair Mercy. 

Of us three, Mercy was most kind and possessing of uncommon inner strength, yet I fear for her. Corrupting such a soul would make for a fearsome creature, indeed.

Stop the vile ritual before Mercy is taken. Allow the dead their rest. Slay Sister Westwood and free us from her grasp!</Description>
