  <Title>A Weapon of Old</Title>
  <Description>I've been studying the parchment Lady Lucille sent with you and have translated some of the older language. 

They called it "Liquid Fire" and it was used to "burn away the Drust". Using this as a basis I believe we can adapt it to our needs. This is a complex recipe, but it just so happens I have everything we need to make this potent alchemical weapon!

I will need your assistance in creating this. Would you be so kind as to help?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Master Ashton create the Liquid Fire potion.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We'd better get cooking!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Wonderful! Smells a bit strong but I think it will burn those wooden constructs well! Now it's time to test it out.</RewardText>
