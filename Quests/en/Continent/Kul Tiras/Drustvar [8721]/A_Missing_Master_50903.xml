  <Title>A Missing Master</Title>
  <Description>Master Ashton had me grab some healing supplies and run to Mayor Royston when those things attacked town. He didn't make it behind the barricade.

But if he's alive--and he's just crazy enough he might be--he's probably holed up in his cottage. With caustic compounds. And explosives.

Look, why don't you go check out his basement and I'll stay out of the blast radi- I mean I'll go see if the garden can be salvaged.

Try not to look flammable.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Master Ashton.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Oh! You're not one of those monsters at all. Did you trounce those brutes?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I appreciate your help in liberating the town! I was becoming quite concerned by these strange monsters.</RewardText>
