  <Title>Research Recovery</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The discarded paper contains a list of the items the Adventurer's Society has found during the course of their 'excavation' here at the Northern Caverns.

It is unlikely they actually found relics, but there's no harm in recovering the items the kids found. At the least they're souvenirs of the adventure.&gt;</Description>
