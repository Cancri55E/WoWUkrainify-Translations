  <Title>Every Day I'm Smugglin'</Title>
  <Description>Hey! Wanna make some quick gold?

See, I had a mishap a few weeks ago with a shipment. Too much grog, dark seas, sudden rocks. You know, that old story.

Anyway, my cargo's been floating out there and no one will get it back for me. Can you believe it? You bring my cargo back and I'll pay you a generous recovery fee.

We got a deal? Great!

Oh, uh, watch out for the sharks. Did I forget to mention the sharks?</Description>
