  <Description>We're barely holding off those monsters here. If it hadn't been for the Thornspeakers, we'd surely be dead. I was worried Rebecca hadn't made it!

You've brought Rebecca's supplies just in time. We have many injured out in the field, Thornspeaker, ranger, and companion alike. I'll hold the line here. Go into the ruins and heal as many of the wounded as you can!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Save $1oa injured Thornspeakers, rangers, and pets.</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>Thank you for helping us, Mainlander.</RewardText>
