  <Title>Cutthroat Business Practices</Title>
  <Description>I used to run the inn here. Was a nice gig. I got first crack a lot of good stuff and all the best gossip and information came through my place.

And then that jerk, Gary Cofferdam, came in and kicked me out! The new Boss laughed! 

I'm lookin' at my last few silvers here. Business is not good!

Tell ya what, you remove my problem and I'll side up with Cesi. She'd never kick me out.</Description>
