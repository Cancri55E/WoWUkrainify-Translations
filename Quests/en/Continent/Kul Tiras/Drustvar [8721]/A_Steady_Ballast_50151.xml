  <Title>A Steady Ballast</Title>
  <Description>The Armory presents us a ripe opportunity, $c... one I suggest we take.

If this battle were to draw out, we have little means to repair our arms and armor. A blacksmith is invaluable to any war effort, and Ballaster is one of our best.

The Armory is but a short ride from here. I suggest you get to Ballaster before it's too late!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Angus Ballaster at the Corlain Armory.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The blacksmith won't survive long with the coven hunting him down. 

I'd recommend leaving posthaste.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Our fortunes are turning up. 

Having a blacksmith at the tower will ensure our Inquisitors stay equipped for battle.</RewardText>
