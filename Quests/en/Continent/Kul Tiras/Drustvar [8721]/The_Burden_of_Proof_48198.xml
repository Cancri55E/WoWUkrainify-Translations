  <Title>The Burden of Proof</Title>
  <Description>I think we have everything we need to conduct three of the villagers' tests. Let us hope this is enough to convince them.

I'm sure Constable Framer is champing at the bit to proceed with his trial, and I would prefer it if you were the one to administer the tests. I may not know you well, but I trust you farther than the constable.

Speak with him when you're ready to begin.

...and do me a favor. Make this quick.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Administer the tests to prove Lucy Waycrest's innocence in Hangman's Point.</LogDescription>

It appears that my absolution may truly be in your hands.</RewardText>
