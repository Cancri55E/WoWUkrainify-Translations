  <Title>To Falconhurst!</Title>
  <Description>Our time here was well spent. The guards in Arom's Stand can handle what few Drust forces remain and I suspect the Drust leader and his magic might have some greater part to play here. 

However we must continue on the mission to Falconhurst. The path on the far side of these ruins will take us there.

I will ride ahead and meet you outside of town!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet Inquisitor Cleardawn outside of Falconhurst.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The town is under siege! No wonder we have not heard from them. We must help them.</RewardText>
