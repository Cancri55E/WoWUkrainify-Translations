  <Title>Painful Memories</Title>
  <Description>A terrible thing happened in this place, and it has doomed me to an eternity of walking these grounds.

All I remember is that Lucille and I were to be wed, but instead I met my end.

If you have an ounce of sympathy in your heart, then I beg you to help me. Find out what happened that night, so I might leave here.

I know my strongest memories are tied to the ring I bore for Lucy that day. Find it among my bones, and maybe it will lead you to the answer.</Description>
