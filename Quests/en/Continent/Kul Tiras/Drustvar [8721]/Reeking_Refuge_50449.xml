  <Description>Oh good, maybe you can make sense of this.

I was just carving through a swath of the coven's lackeys when I stumbled across this field. Something here has knocked these guys completely out of commission!

  <LogDescription>Investigate what is disabling the coven's minions in Hocking's Plot.</LogDescription>
