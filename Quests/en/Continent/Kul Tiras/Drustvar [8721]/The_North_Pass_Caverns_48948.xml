  <Title>The North Pass Caverns</Title>
  <Description>Please, you must help!

My grandson got lost around the caves to the north, and I'm so afraid that the troggs might have got him!  

My husband went after him, but he's getting on in years, and I fear he imagines himself tougher than he really is.

Could you help them? You should be able to catch up with Thaddeus along the northern road.</Description>
