  <Title>Changing of the Guard</Title>
  <Description>I have no doubt that you're a quite capable $c, mainlander, but we will need some help if we want to make it to Waycrest Manor in one piece.  A small group would be ideal; strong enough to face the coven's threats, but small enough to remain largely unnoticed.

&lt;Reade produces a bundle of letters.&gt;

I have written new orders to some of my finest soldiers to join your Order of Embers. They will report to you and the lady Waycrest. Please deliver these to them, so they can be prepared to move out.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver recruitment orders to Captain Cleardawn, Ensign Yorrick, Ensign Mace, Lieutenant Sterntide, and Falconer Notley in Arom's Stand.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You will need to gather your recruits before we venture forth.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It is with reluctance that I hand command of these men over to you, but it must be done.

I hope you lead them well.</RewardText>
