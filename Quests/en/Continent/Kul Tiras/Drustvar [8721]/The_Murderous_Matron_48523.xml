  <Title>The Murderous Matron</Title>
  <Description>I know that you've got what you came for, but I need to ask you one more favor.  This town won't be safe until this Matron Levae is taken care of. 

According to the letter, she must be holed up in that cave. None of our people have been able to enter it, but I know I've seen their constructs go in!

This charm you found might be the key. If you can take control of one of these wicker men and send it after her, we might have a shot!</Description>
