  <Title>Witchrending</Title>
  <Description>A blunderbuss? I'd have to say, I wasn't quite expecting that.

Nonetheless, now that we have a weapon, we have an advantage. I think it's time we take the fight directly to the coven.

Marshal Reade informed me that several of their Matrons have been spotted throughout Corlain. Let's show them what happens to an enemy of House Waycrest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Witchrend to defeat Matrons Ceridwen, Adeline, and Letitia in Corlain.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you taken care of the Matrons?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Let us hope this sends a message to the coven.  As long as we have weapons to fight them, we will persevere.

Speaking of weapons, I believe our blacksmith has an idea on how to take down that barrier. You should have a word with him.</RewardText>
