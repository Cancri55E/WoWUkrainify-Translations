  <Title>Mistakes Were Made</Title>
  <Description>My friends and I wanna be explorers so we made the Society. There are troggs here, right? So that means there's probably ancient stuff nearby!

The books say troggs like shiny things so we pooled some of our allowance and gave them gold so we could dig.

It didn't work out like we expected.

I escaped but they've got my friends! I've been trying to think about how to get them out.

Could you do it? We'll include you in our exploration report as an honorary member!</Description>

  <RewardText>Yay! You saved my friends!$B$BI mean, they probably could have escaped on their own, but it was nice you could distract the troggs for 'em.</RewardText>
