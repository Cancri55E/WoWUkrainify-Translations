  <Description>I have a favor to ask you of a... personal nature.

Whitegrove Chapel lies to the north, just past the town of Corlain. Someone... important to me rests in the graveyard on its grounds.

I've been unable to visit his grave for some time, and I would like to pay my respects. If you come upon Whitegrove Chapel, could you lay these flowers next to his headstone?

Just look for the most recent grave there...</Description>
