  <Description>Whoa there! What business do you have in Drustvar?

Lookin' for someone from House Waycrest? Best of luck to ye.  Even us in their guard haven't heard a word from them of late. Why, if it weren't for Marshal Reade takin' command, I doubt there'd even be a Waycrest Guard anymore.

I think ye'd be better off on yer way, but if yer bent on stayin' I'd head over to Fallhaven. The mayor there is probably the only welcomin' soul left around here.

Watch yer back, mainlander. There's dark workings about.</Description>
