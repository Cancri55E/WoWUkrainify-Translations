  <Title>Storming the Manor</Title>
  <Description>Now is our chance. Waycrest Manor is just up that hill, and hopefully inside we'll find my mother and father. 

If we also manage to find the "Mother" that's leading this horrible coven, then we will make her regret the day she ever set foot in Drustvar.

Are you with me, $c?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Follow Lucille Waycrest toward Waycrest Manor in Upper Corlain.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'm sorry... this is all a bit too much...

Thank you, $c, for protecting me.  I think I'm going to need a moment...</RewardText>
