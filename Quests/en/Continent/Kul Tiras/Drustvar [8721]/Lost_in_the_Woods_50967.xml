  <Title>Lost in the Woods</Title>
  <Description>My student, Amalie, and I have taken it upon ourselves to act as the keepers of these woods. We were away from Drustvar briefly, and upon our return, found the grove infested and the surrounding land corrupted.

Amalie decided that she could deal with the grove infestation alone.

It's been some time since she ran off, could you look for her while you're in the Ashenwood?</Description>
