  <Title>In the Hall of the Drust King</Title>
  <Description>I've been watching a lot of activity going on at the ruins at the base of the massive tree by the lake. What Master Ashton reported is accurate - something important is going on down there. 

We've disrupted their rituals but I worry we might have been too late.

We need to go over there. If there is anything remaining, we must destroy it.</Description>
