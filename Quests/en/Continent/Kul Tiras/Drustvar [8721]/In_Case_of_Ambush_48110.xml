  <Title>In Case of Ambush</Title>
  <Description>There is more to worry about in these woods than simple beasts. Our enemy employs constructs of wicker and bone that can rip a man apart.

Fortunately for us, these constructs are not very perceptive.

Take these traps and set them up throughout the woods behind us.  If our enemies do seek to ambush us here, at least these will slow their minions down.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place 6 traps in the Watcher's Wood.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We must be prepared. Anywhere can harbor an ambush here.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good, those traps should alert us in case anything tries to sneak up on us through the woods.

You have bought us a modicum of safety, $c.</RewardText>
