  <Title>The Road to Corlain</Title>
  <Description>Lord and Lady Waycrest lay trapped in Waycrest Manor. Before we can reach them, however, we must brave through the city of Corlain... which is firmly in the grasp of the Heartsbane.

Our first course of action should be to set up a forward outpost. Our scouts have found that the tower at Watchman's Rise is only lightly guarded. I recommend we take the tower from them.

This is now your command, Inquisitor. Say the word, and we ride.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet with Marshal Reade at Watchman's Rise in Drustvar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Good, you've arrived. 

This tower watches over Corlain and the surrounding lands. Apparently it is of little value to the coven, but to us it would serve as a valuable foothold.</RewardText>
