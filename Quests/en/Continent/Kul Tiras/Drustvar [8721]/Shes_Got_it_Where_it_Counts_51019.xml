  <Title>She's Got it Where it Counts</Title>
  <Description>Word is you're looking to drum up support for Loosecannon. Well I'll buy in if you help me. They took my poor Miranda! 

Boss Tornsail says I had too much to drink and bet her in cards. I don't really remember what happened last night, but I can hold my liquor and I'd never bet my bird! I suspect funny business. She might not look like much, but Miranda's the fastest damn falcon you'll ever see.

They're watching me, so you go free her. She'll fly someplace safe and I'll get her later. We got a deal?</Description>
