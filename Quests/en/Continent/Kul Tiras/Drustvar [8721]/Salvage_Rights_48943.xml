  <Title>Salvage Rights</Title>
  <Description>This poor trader was set upon by the yetis.  There's nothing we can do for him now, but we would be remiss to let his supplies be laid to waste by these brutes.

See if you can find any supplies worth salvaging. You can use Bella as a pack horse.

Don't worry, she's a brave mare. She won't spook easily.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover the Wrapped Supplies, Cask of Salted Fish, Hardened Lockbox, and Bucket of Grain from Alpine Rise.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you found anything salvageable?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I'm impressed. I didn't think there would be this much left from his shipment. This will be very helpful to our men at the gate.$B$BBella knows the way, so she should be able to get these to them.  This place is too dangerous to keep her hitched up, anyway.</RewardText>
