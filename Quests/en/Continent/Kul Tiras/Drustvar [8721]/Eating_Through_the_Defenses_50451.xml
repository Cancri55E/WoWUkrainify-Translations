  <Title>Eating Through the Defenses</Title>
  <Description>Not sure why and don't rightly care, but for some reason the coven can't come near my onion field. So long as my crop doesn't give out, I can hole up in here as long as it takes.

Unfortunately, those boars got the same idea and now they're eatin' up my harvest! If they keep that up, soon there'll be nothin' keepin' the coven at bay!

If you can do me a favor and thin them out, I'd be happy to let you take some of these onions with you.</Description>
