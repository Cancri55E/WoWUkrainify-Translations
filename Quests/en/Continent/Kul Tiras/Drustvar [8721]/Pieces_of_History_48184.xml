  <Title>Pieces of History</Title>
  <Description>There is an opportunity here.

Learning more about the Drust can not only help us understand the texts that Lady Lucille found, we might be able to discover greater details about how they and their constructs were finally defeated. Filling in the gaps of history could be key to victory now.

This was one of their settlements before it became the place of their final defeat. Let's look for clues in the ruins.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search the ruins for information about the Drust.</LogDescription>
