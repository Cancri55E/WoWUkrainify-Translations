  <Description>The Thornspeakers were assisting me but they have troubles of their own.

I came in search of a powerful dragon who fell in battle many centuries ago. Melting snows have revealed Vadekius's final resting place.

My Queen has tasked me with ensuring his body cannot be reanimated and enslaved. The ritual will require my full attention and my druid friends aren't fit for combat.

Watch my back while I ensure my cousin's soul flies amid the branches of G'Hanir, safe from undeath.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Protect Zallestrasza while she conducts the ritual.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Will you watch my back as I complete the ritual?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for your help.</RewardText>
