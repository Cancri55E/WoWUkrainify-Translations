  <Title>Leaving the Nest</Title>
  <Description>It looks like the coven hasn't managed to enthrall all of our falcons. I can see some untainted ones still in cages in the training yard.

Our falcons are well trained, and should know to fly to one of our other yards if something happens to their handlers. 

If you can just release them from their cages, they should be able to make it to safety.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Open $1oa Falcon Cages in the Corlain Aviary.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Are they safe?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Nice work!  With any luck, the falcons should head back to roost at Arom's Stand.

Though really, I'd prefer they be anywhere other than in the coven's clutches.

You have my thanks.</RewardText>
