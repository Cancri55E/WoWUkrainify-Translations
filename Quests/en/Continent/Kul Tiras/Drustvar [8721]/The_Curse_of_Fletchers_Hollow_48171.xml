  <Title>The Curse of Fletcher's Hollow</Title>
  <Description>It's obvious the constable won't be swayed until we discover what happened at Fletcher's Hollow. I know very little myself--only that the village has been overrun by monstrous creatures.

I must ask that you travel there in my stead and try to uncover what befell the village. I'm sure Marshal Reade will prevent the constable from harming me while you're away.

Do this for me, and I will help you as I can.</Description>
