  <Title>The Three Sisters</Title>
  <Description>If you're looking to absolve Miss Waycrest of this mess, you'll need to head into the town. Recently, I've seen some oddly dressed women among the creatures, who seem to be calling the shots.

It's likely that they're the key to this whole nightmare, but we can't get in to question them. Their minions don't seem to slow you down, though. 

If you can get to them, you might be able to find some answers for the both of us.  Be careful, though. They likely aren't very friendly.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Confront Sister Ashwell, Sister Early, and Sister Mooring in Fletcher's Hollow.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you confronted the strange women?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>They weren't willing to talk?  That's unfortunate.

At least with them gone, we may stand a chance to take back the town.</RewardText>
