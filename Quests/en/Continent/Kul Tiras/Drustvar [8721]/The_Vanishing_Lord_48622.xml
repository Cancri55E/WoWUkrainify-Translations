  <Title>The Vanishing Lord</Title>
  <Description>Unfortunately, we don't have any contacts within House Waycrest, so our efforts in Drustvar will have to start from the ground up.

We have arranged for a ferry to take you to Fallhaven - a farming village in eastern Drustvar. The mayor there, Cyril White, is a longtime friend of the Proudmoores, and I think he can help us get in touch with someone from the house.

I hope you can get to the bottom of their absence, $n. Their martial might is invaluable to the Kul Tiran fleet.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet with Cyril White in Fallhaven in Drustvar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;The effigy is protected by powerful magic. 

It seems it will take more than brute force to break this curse.&gt;</RewardText>
