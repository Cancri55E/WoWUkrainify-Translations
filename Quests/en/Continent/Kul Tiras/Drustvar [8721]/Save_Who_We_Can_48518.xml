  <Title>Save Who We Can</Title>
  <Description>These things seem intent on capturing our people... but we're not quite sure what for.

The ones in the town might be too tough to reach right now, but we might be able to save some of the woodsmen who work along the strand.

Head to the lumber fields just east of here, and see if there's anyone still alive out there. We can shelter them here until we can arrange safe passage out of here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rally 6 Frightened Woodsmen in the Timbered Strand.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were there any survivors?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good work, $c! Even if we don't manage to take the town back, it's good to know we were able to save some of our people.

Now we just have to get them out of here...</RewardText>
