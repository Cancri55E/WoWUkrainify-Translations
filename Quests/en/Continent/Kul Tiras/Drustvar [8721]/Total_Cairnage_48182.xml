  <Title>Total Cairnage</Title>
  <Description>My mentor sensed the activation of ancient powers here. We came to stop them but were too late. We banded together with the rangers for mutual protection, but our task remains unfinished.

There is a set of ancient cairns here. These help empower the Drust constructs. Destroying them will also help to settle the undead stirring from the land.

Destroy the cairns and we'll be able to bring sanity to this place.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy the Ancient Cairns.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Power within those cairns does not bode well for anyone in Drustvar.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for destroying those cairns. We should be able to dismantle the Drust constructs and risen dead more easily now.</RewardText>
