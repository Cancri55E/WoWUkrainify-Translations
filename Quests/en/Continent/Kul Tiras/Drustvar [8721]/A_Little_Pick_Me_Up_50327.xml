  <Title>A Little 'Pick Me Up'</Title>
  <Description>Now to mix this up. 

&lt;Marten begins to combine the components in a mug&gt;

I'm using some rather strong grog as a base, a drop of chilli extract and a handful of hearthbloom... There!

&lt;Marten hands you a mug&gt;

It will taste worse than it smells, but it will bring Master Ashton to his senses. Please give this mug to him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Give the mug to Master Ashton.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Oh! I say!$b
&lt;Ashton shudders and coughs&gt;$b
A bit less hearthbloom next time, Marten, but that did just the trick. Well done both of you.</RewardText>
