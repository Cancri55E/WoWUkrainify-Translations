  <Title>Stopping the Grand Rite</Title>
  <Description>The witches of the Crimsonwood are planning a Grand Rite, a powerful ritual. They intend to rip open reality and bring their dark master through!

I suspect they may be in communion with Gorak Tul. We cannot allow their ritual to succeed.

I need you to be the tip of the spear while I protect Master Ashton and Marten. Cause havoc and disrupt their rituals!</Description>
