  <Description>Our destination is that cottage up ahead. I know it doesn't look like much, but a great deal of history is hidden inside.

First, though, we'll need to deal with that massive yeti camped just outside. I'd hate to ask it of you, but I'll need you to draw his attention so I can slip inside.

Once you've taken care of him, I'll meet you within.</Description>
