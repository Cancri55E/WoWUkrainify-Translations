  <Title>A Weather Eye</Title>
  <Description>It would be wise to get a lay of the land before we put together a plan of action. 

Inquisitor Notley is an expert falconer, and a reliable scout. He utilizes an ancient relic to see through the eyes of his falcon, allowing him to survey great distances. 

Unfortunately, Notley was injured during the fighting. Nothing serious, but it's left him unable to concentrate enough to control his falcon.

Perhaps you could help?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Inquisitor Notley at Watchman's Rise to scout the areas surrounding Corlain.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What news do you bring?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It is good to know that there are still some left to save in Corlain. 

We should focus our attention on them until we can devise a plan to bypass that barrier.

I'll make sure to get this whistle back to Notley. Thank you, $c.</RewardText>
