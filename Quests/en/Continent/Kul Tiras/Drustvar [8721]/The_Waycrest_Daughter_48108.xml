  <Title>The Waycrest Daughter</Title>
  <Description>You seek House Waycrest? Oh, your timing could not be worse!

I had just received a raven regarding Lord Waycrest's daughter, Lucille, shortly before this... curse came upon us.  They apprehended her in Fletcher's Hollow and are taking her to trial.

They say she is a witch, herself! 

If she's found guilty, she will surely hang! You must make haste to Hangman's Point.  With what you've seen here, maybe you can convince them of her innocence.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet with Constable Henry Framer at Hangman's Point in Drustvar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Can't you see that we're busy here, $c?

I assume you have a reason for interrupting this trial...</RewardText>
