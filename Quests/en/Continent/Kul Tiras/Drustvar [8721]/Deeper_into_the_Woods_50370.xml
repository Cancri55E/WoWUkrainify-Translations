  <Title>Deeper into the Woods</Title>
  <Description>We need to go deeper into the forest. The witches are clearly up to something even worse than I'd imagined.

As much as I have a duty to return to Lady Lucille with Master Ashton, I also have a duty to find out more about this threat to our people, and stop it if I can.

Going further into the forest is not without risk, but I believe it is one worth taking.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel with Cleardawn, Ashton, and Webb deeper into the forest.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>By my ancestors' anchors that is a large army! At least it doesn't appear to be mobile yet. And the tree... Clearly it is the focus of their efforts.</RewardText>
