  <Title>Asking for a Friend</Title>
  <Description>Hey! Since you helped Cesi I thought maybe you might do a favor for me.

Well, uh, y'see Miss Sweetflower over there? Sweet as honey, sharp as a tack, and cooks like a goddess.

I'm not much to look at, but the lady might think kindly on me if I could surprise her with a gift. A really great gift! But I can't leave m'post or these red-coated jerks might run off with the merchandise. 

This is where you come in. Find out what Miss Sweetflower wants, get it and bring it back to me.</Description>
