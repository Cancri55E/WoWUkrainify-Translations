  <Title>The High Thornspeaker</Title>
  <Description>My teacher, Ulfar, the High Thornspeaker, must be informed of what's been going on here.

I can't leave just yet. There are too many wounded and we'll need to handle the last few remaining constructs.

You have proven trustworthy, friend. Take a few of these runic cores to Ulfar for me. 

Arthur will meet you at the head of the path to Ulfar's den.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take the Runic Power Cores to Ulfar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>What do you have here, mainlander? Ah, I see. My students met with much stronger threats than we'd expected.

Thank you for helping them.</RewardText>
