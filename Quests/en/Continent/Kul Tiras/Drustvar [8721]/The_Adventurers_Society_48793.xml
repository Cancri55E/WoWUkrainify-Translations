  <Title>The Adventurer's Society</Title>
  <Description>Thank the Light!

I was taking care of my grandson and his friends. I told them to play quietly while I took a nap. When I woke up they'd left a note saying they were 'Going on an Expedition'. They think they'll find Titan relics in the trogg caverns!

They're too young to fight troggs and I'm too old! My bad knee almost gave out getting here.

You look strapping. Find my grandson and the rest of the 'Adventurer's Society'. Send them home!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Look for signs of the children.</LogDescription>
