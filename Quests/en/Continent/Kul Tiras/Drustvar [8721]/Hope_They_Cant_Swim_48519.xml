  <Title>Hope They Can't Swim</Title>
  <Description>We've got a small boat docked right across the way there. If we can get these villagers safely on board, they should be able to make it to Fallhaven by river.

You're a capable fighter, no doubt. Can I count on you to fend off any attackers while we get them to safety?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defend the villagers as they board the boat in the Timbered Strand.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We can begin evacuating on your mark.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $c. Those villagers owe you their lives.

Now that they're safe, we can focus on taking back the town.</RewardText>
