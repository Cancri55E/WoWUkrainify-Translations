  <Title>Harmful If Swallowed</Title>
  <Description>This last test I am not looking forward to, but it is certainly better than being set on fire. 

They say that a witch can't get sick. We will prove to them that I can.

A venom comes from the saurolisks nearby that is used by our healers when a child swallows something they shouldn't. When ingested, it will make you immediately ill, emptying the contents of the stomach.

You'll need several of their venom glands to get enough venom for an appropriate dose. Removing them intact may prove difficult.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Intact Venom Glands from the Shallows Saurolisks near Hangman's Point.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is the deed done?</CompletionText>

Gah, I can't believe I'm going to go through with this.</RewardText>
