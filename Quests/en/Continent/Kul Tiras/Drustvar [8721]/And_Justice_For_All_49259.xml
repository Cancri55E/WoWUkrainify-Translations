  <Title>And Justice For All</Title>
  <Description>Thank you for helping to redeem me in the eyes of my people, $c. I am in your debt, and I will be sure to let my father know.

In the mean time, I think we should find out what this Heartsbane Coven is, and what they are doing in our lands. I hope the marshal will be able to enlighten us.

First thing's first, though. Care to undo these ropes? They're starting to chafe.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Leave Hangman's Point with Lucille Waycrest.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This situation is much worse than I had thought. The coven has taken House Waycrest?! This will not stand!

Wait... you mentioned that they were drawing their power from an ancient ruin?

I think I might have an idea.</RewardText>
