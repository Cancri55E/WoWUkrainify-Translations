  <Title>Culling the Coven</Title>
  <Description>If the mine really was their objective, I can only imagine they'd have even more forces in there.  

My men and I may be able to take care of the remnants out here, but if an even bigger force comes out of that mine, we're not going to stand a chance.

While you're hunting down the matron with this wicker contraption, do you think you could... you know... soften them up a bit?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa of Matron Levae's minions in the Elderstone Mine.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you go into the mines? What was it like in there?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Wait... you're telling me it was even worse in the mines?

You know what? Just don't tell me about it. So long as you killed... whatever was in there... I think we'll be okay.</RewardText>
