  <Title>A Pungent Solution</Title>
  <Description>The first test should be simple enough. While I may not do so often, I am certainly capable of crying.

Though to be honest, I've never had to cry on cue.

Maybe you could help with that, though. Nearby there is an onion field that belonged to one of the local farmers. It's abandoned, and most of it is dried up by now, but you might be able to find one onion ripe enough in there to cause some tears.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect a Juicy Onion from Hawthorne's Plot near Hangman's Point.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you had any luck at the onion field?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Great, you found one! I was worried that there wouldn't be much left growing on that farm. 

The people of Drustvar could learn a thing or two from that hardy onion.</RewardText>
