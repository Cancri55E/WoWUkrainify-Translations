  <Title>Bramblethorn</Title>
  <Description>I was playing with Lord and Lady Sharptooth when Papa made me come with him. I dropped poor Lord Sharptooth and one of those big mean monsters grabbed him! 

Papa said he'd try to get him back but he's been gone a long time. I think he got busy. Mama and all the adults are busy doing stuff for Mayor Royston.

Lady Sharptooth and I are really sad. Can you beat up that mean monster and save my dino?</Description>
