  <Title>Sharp Thinking</Title>
  <Description>I have reason to believe that the coven has already infiltrated Arom's Stand. There are many unfamiliar faces here, with the refugees from Corlain, and we know they can use their magic to appear like one of us.

This needle is fashioned of solid silver. If the witches are indeed vulnerable to silver, then a prick from this may be enough to break their spell. 

The refugees may not be keen on being prodded, but they must understand that this is for the good of the town... and perhaps all of Drustvar.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Lucille's Sewing Needle on $1oa Corlain Refugees to reveal the hidden witches in Arom's Stand.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I really hope this works...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It worked?! I knew we were on the right track!

It's too bad we don't have a stockpile of silver weapons lying around, but I think I know how we can deal with that.</RewardText>
