  <Title>A Farmer's Fate</Title>
  <Description>Old Jakob here was one of the few folks who were never wary of us. I have, on occasion, even helped him around his farm in return for supplies. It is an injustice just to ignore his plight even amidst our own problems.

The corruption which holds him seems to be early in form. I believe I can cleanse it.

Take this branch, and bring it to the three shrines around the Ashenwood. That should allow it to gather enough energy for the ritual.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Empower the Everliving Branch.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you finish your task?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The wood remembers, and guides us. This should be enough power to help this farmer.</RewardText>
