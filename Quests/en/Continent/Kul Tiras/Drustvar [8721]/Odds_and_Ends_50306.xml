  <Description>Master Ashton's going to probably need something bracing once we get him free. I know of a quick potion guaranteed to get anyone to snap out of it, but I'm going to need a few things first.

Those wicker dogs down there have some organic parts I can use and the witches are carrying bags of reagents. They'll almost certainly have what I need.

Bring those to me and I'll handle the rest once we get Master Ashton back.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Organic Matter Samples and $2oa Bags of Reagents.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you have any luck?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hmm... Very interesting. And pungent. Perhaps my first order of business will be something to remove the smell.</RewardText>
