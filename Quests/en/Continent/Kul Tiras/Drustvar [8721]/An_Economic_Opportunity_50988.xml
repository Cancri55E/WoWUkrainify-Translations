  <Title>An Economic Opportunity</Title>
  <Description>You look savvy enough to jump on an opportunity when one comes by and, pal, do I have one for you.

See that cove down there? It's run by entrepreneurs with an eye towards meeting the logistical shortfalls that might come up in your typical city or town situation. Well, it's normally run by them.

We have a bit of an infestation by folks who are more mercenary minded if you catch my meaning.

You help me win back control of the cove and I'll see you're treated well. Sound good?</Description>
