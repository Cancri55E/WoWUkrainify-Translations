  <Title>One Man Against the Horde</Title>
  <Description>Me an' a few friends were trying to help some of the folks from Corlain flee safely to Arom's Stand after things started gettin' weird. I noticed some movement up the hill so I decided to come back and check it out. If the town goin' mad wasn't bad enough, now we have another problem to deal with.

The Horde.
