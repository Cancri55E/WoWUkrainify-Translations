  <Title>A Traitor's Death</Title>
  <Description>It has come to my attention that you intend to assault the camp outside of the walls. If this is so, I have a request.

Though most of the guardsmen who fight against us were turned to the coven against their will, Captain Goodspeed and his brigade of halberdiers gave their souls willingly to the Heartsbane. They are traitors and an affront to the Waycrest Guard.

You will find Goodspeed and his men stationed at the camp.  I would consider it a personal favor if you would cut them down to the last.</Description>

  <CompletionText>Is it done?</CompletionText>

I hope his end was painful.</RewardText>
