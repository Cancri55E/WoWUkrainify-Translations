  <Title>Really Big Problem</Title>
  <Description>Hey! Mainlander!

I know I'm supposed to be trying to knock over cairns and hauling out lost rangers, but d'you see that massive stone monster? I'm thinking that's gonna be a problem.

You look like you know how to handle yourself. Think between the two of us we can take it down?</Description>

  <RewardText>I suppose I'm not really surprised Arthur didn't exactly follow orders. But I don't think I can complain with the results.

Thanks for making sure he wasn't entirely in over his head.</RewardText>
