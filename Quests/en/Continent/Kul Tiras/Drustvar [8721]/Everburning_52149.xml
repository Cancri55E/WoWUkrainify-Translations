  <Title>Everburning</Title>
  <Description>My people have suffered loss and pain, struggling in the darkness that covered Drustvar. But now we have some light back. We have the means and the will to reclaim our lands from the lingering evils. Your help has brought much of that about.

I will miss my parents. Though their end was dark, they were family. But my duty as the head of House Waycrest is clear. The dead can handle themselves. I must attend to the living and lead.

There is a short ceremony I need to conduct. Would you assist me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Assist in the ceremony by the statue in Arom's Stand.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Thank you.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I must continue to set my House in order, but our relations with the rest of Kul Tiras have suffered neglect for too long. I have some additional things to handle here first, but I will go to Boralus soon to set the rest right.

My deepest thanks for all you have done, $n.</RewardText>
