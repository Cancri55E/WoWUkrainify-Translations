  <Title>Yeti to Rumble</Title>
  <Description>It would seem that the guard have been lax in patrolling the Highroad Pass. The mountain yetis have taken advantage of their absence, and now lie directly in our path.

I am no soldier, $c, so I will need to ask that you take care of them while I try to sneak past.  If we can drive them off the road, at least it will make the pass safe again for travelers.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa Chillfur Yetis in Alpine Rise.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We should drive the yetis back from the road. Having a major trade route cut off by monsters isn't going to help our fight against the coven.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $c. Keeping the pass clear will ensure a steady stream of supplies to Highroad Gate.

We will need them in the battles to come.</RewardText>
