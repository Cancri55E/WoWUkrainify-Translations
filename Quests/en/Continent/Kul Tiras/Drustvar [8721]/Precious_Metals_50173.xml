  <Description>$C, I have another objective we should consider. 

The Bleak Hills Mine is not too far from our location. Though the miners there principally extract iron, they do on occasion find silver among the veins.

We do not know the current state of the mine, but it's unlikely that the coven has passed it over. However, it would be worth braving whatever dangers lie there to recover some silver to use against them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Silver Nuggets from the Bleak Hills Mine.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you have any luck with the mine?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You found some silver? Excellent!

Though it isn't much, any quantity of silver should help our efforts against the coven!</RewardText>
