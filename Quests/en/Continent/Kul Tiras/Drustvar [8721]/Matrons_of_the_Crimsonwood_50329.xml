  <Title>Matrons of the Crimsonwood</Title>
  <Description>The witches in charge, the matrons...

&lt;Ashton shudders for a moment then composes himself.&gt;

The matrons are the ones leading the Grand Rite. They are fearsome but not invulnerable. Removing some of them from the equation will bolster our chances of stopping this. 

Take this potion. It will be able to weaken the matrons so you might have a better chance of dispatching them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Matrons Elsbeth Garrick, Stefania Denholm, and Wilona Blackwood.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you kill them?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The potion worked even better than anticipated! It is heartening to know my time spent in the witches'... care has yielded positive results.

Losing some of their leadership will certainly set them back.</RewardText>
