  <Title>Quill or Be Quilled</Title>
  <Description>Oh, hello there. Sorry, we don't get many mainlanders in these parts.

This plot was my husband Sam's farm. He used to tend to the onion fields every day before the curse befell Glenbrook and took him with it.

With my husband gone, this farm is all I have left, and these quillrats are making sure I don't get even that.

I'd hate to bother a perfect stranger, but could you help quell this infestation?</Description>

  <CompletionText>These quillrats are truly a menace!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $c.

Maybe in reviving these fields I can bring a bit of Sam's goodness back to this accursed land.</RewardText>
