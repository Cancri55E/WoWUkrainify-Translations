  <Title>One Last Request</Title>
  <Description>I can feel my bonds to this place slipping, and I have you to thank.

I would like to ask one more favor of you though. Please bring the ring you found to Lucille. It was meant for her to hold, not my dusty bones.

And $c, do not tell her what has transpired here. She has enough tragedy weighing down her heart. I do not wish to add to it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Treadward's Ring to Lucille Waycrest at Watchman's Rise.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What... what's this?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This... this is the ring Alexander was to give me at our wedding.  I had thought it long lost...

I do not know how you found this, $c, but words cannot say how grateful I am. Alexander was very dear to me, and this ring was a symbol of the strength of our love.

It is good to feel that again...</RewardText>
