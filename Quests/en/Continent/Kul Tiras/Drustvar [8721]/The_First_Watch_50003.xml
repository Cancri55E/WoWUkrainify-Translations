  <Title>The First Watch</Title>
  <Description>As you can see, the coven has conscripted my own guardsmen into their service. Though I am loath to battle my own, these men are too corrupted by the coven's magic to be saved.

For them, death is the only mercy we can give.

The Inquisitors and I can handle the regiment stationed outside. We will need you to find and take out their leader.

Your Inquisitors await your command, $c. Are you ready to take the tower?</Description>
