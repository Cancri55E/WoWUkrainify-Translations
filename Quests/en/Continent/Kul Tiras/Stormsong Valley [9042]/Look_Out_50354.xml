  <Title>Look Out!</Title>
  <Description>Some of these quilboar are clearly lookouts. Those horns make it obvious, almost like I could see their task floating above their heads.$b$bI was able to kill one, but not before he blew that horn of his and summoned backup. I suggest you keep them silent before they do the same with you.$b$bIf we're going to get anywhere in there, you'll need to do it quietly. Here, Hobbs gave me a few of his sleeping darts. That should keep them quiet.</Description>
