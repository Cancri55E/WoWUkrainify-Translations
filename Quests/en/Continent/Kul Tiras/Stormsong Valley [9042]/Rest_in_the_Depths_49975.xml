  <Description>This passage flows through the Shrine of the Storm out into the open sea. We will release the souls of the fallen here.

Legends say that as our spirits pass through the Shrine, they aid in the great blessing rituals that all Kul Tiran ships undergo. 

In that way, we Stormsong never stop serving our people.</Description>
