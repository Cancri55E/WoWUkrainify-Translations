  <Description>When the naga force first arrived, there were a handful of the local fishermen out on boats. One of our scouts reports that most of them have been captured and are currently being kept in cages around the beach.

Free any of them you happen to find and point them back here. We'll get them armed and remind the naga that you don't mess with sailors!</Description>
