  <Title>Aww, Rats!</Title>
  <Description>I didn't sign up for this! I just want to get back to the simple things, like grinding wheat and drinking mead.

As if things couldn't get any worse around here, there's an army of rats ransacking the shed and I don't have the stomach to exterminate them.

Here, I got this off some crazy gnome that stopped into port recently. I thought maybe it'd help with the bees. Maybe you can try it on the rats?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Bilge Rats.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you so much. I'll get rid of these little guys.</RewardText>
