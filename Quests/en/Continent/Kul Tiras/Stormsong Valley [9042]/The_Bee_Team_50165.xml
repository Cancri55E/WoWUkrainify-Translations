  <Title>The Bee Team</Title>
  <Description>We need to put things in order, and the next item on the list is these blasted wendigos terrorizing the farm. 

If we can cull their numbers, it should be enough to drive them off!

I've synthesized a superb solution that might be just what we need to solvent this sticky situation!

Toss these bottles at your foes and our friendly little apoideas should come to help.

Whatever you do, please don't spill any on yourself...</Description>
