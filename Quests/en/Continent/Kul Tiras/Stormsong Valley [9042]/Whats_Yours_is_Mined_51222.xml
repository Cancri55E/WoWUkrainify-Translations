  <Title>What's Yours is Mined</Title>
  <Description>During a visit to Pandaria, I witnessed the citizens of Halfhill defeat attacking hozen by flinging the hozen's excrement back at them.  

The hozen were unprepared to face the wrath of their own weaponry used against them. A similar strategy can be applied here. We will gather Venture Co. Sea Mines and use them against the invaders.  

You hook ropes to each mine, and Ai'twen and I will haul them up.</Description>
