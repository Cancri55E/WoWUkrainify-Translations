  <Title>Stop Vining!</Title>
  <Description>You may have noticed that the fields are a little... unstable right now.$b$bThe Briarback have been busy, growing those large bramble vines and boring tunnels underneath the farm. The vines have always been an important part of their borders, and they're expanding!$b$bGo down into the lower area and see if you can find who or what is making those vines grow. There's no way that they're growing like that naturally. If we can stop the vines we can retake this area!</Description>
