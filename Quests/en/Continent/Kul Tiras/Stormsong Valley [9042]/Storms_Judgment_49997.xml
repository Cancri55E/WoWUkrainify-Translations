  <Title>Storm's Judgment</Title>
  <Description>When I opened my mind to the currents during the ritual, I felt the presence of a member of Lord Stormsong's innermost circle.

I will not stand by while my brothers move against our own people. Oaths be damned.

We must force Reid to see reason.</Description>
