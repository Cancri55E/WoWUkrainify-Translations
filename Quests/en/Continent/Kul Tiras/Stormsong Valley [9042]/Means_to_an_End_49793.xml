  <Title>Means to an End</Title>
  <Description>In our haste to journey here I did not think to bring my ritual implements we tidesages use to augment our power.

To be honest, I had never expected them necessary on what should have been a peaceful sojourn.

Addington does not have his, either. I am sure the militia took him from his home before he had the chance to react.

That means his implements should still be in the yard somewhere. We must find them before my power is of much real use.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve Brother Addington's Tidal Kris, Abyssal Beacon, and Wavecaller's Mantle.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Those initiates were nowhere near ready to wield our sacred implements. They are far better served in our hands.</RewardText>
