  <Title>A Bloody Mess</Title>
  <Description>My order blesses every Kul Tiran ship within the halls of the Shrine of the Storm. Our blessings make our ships the strongest in all of Azeroth; the fleet of legend.

The ritual requires a substance known as tideblood. It is a viscous, powerful substance dredged from the depths of the sea and infused into the very hull of each ship.

Something has caused the tideblood here to become animate. Studying it may help us better understand our enemy.</Description>
