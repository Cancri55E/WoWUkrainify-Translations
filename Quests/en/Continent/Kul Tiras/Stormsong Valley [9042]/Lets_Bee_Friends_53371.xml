  <Title>Let's Bee Friends</Title>
  <Description>We just need to collect some slime from the animated honey creatures that are still roaming around the farm.

If you can bring back a few vials of that, we can put all our ingredients together and give the mixture to Bumbles.

We should only feed him once a day, or he might get sick like some of the other bees.

We're gonna have him all healed up in no time!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 Vials of Honey Slime and mix them with Raimond's Secret Ingredient to make Mildenhall's Growth Formula, then feed it to Bumbles.</LogDescription>
