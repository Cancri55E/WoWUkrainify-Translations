  <Title>Any Ammo Will Do</Title>
  <Description>I'll have some men move some cannons down to the sea wall in preparation of whatever ritual is going on down in that delta.

We could use some extra ammo before we spread ourselves too thin though. Luckily, those naga harpoons work well enough with our mortars. Take down those lances and bring back any harpoons that you find.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Zeth'jir Harpoons on the coast south of Fort Daelin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We can use the naga's weapons against them!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Great work! Let's hope these harpoons can fire from our cannons.</RewardText>
