  <Title>Wendigo Away</Title>
  <Description>If the unearthly howls coming from the Highlands at night are any indication, the wendigos must have some sort of leader or alpha.

I tell you, it's the sort of sound that could only come from some sort of massive, hulking, flesh-eating abomination.

Definitely something that could tear us limb from limb, and munch on our frail bones, all without breaking a sweat. How exhilarating!

I'm sure it'll be no problem for us to handle though.</Description>
