  <Title>Oathbound</Title>
  <Description>I took oaths, damn it. We all did.

When Lord Stormsong sent the first orders... well, you saw what happened. What matters is that our oaths are to our people, not Lord "Sells His Soul".

You won't find him here - he's deep in the Shrine by now, and no outsider will make it across the channel alive...

Not without a Tideguard to open the way.

&lt;Victoria locks eyes with you.&gt;

The Rod of Tides is the key to the front door, and it's kept here. Retrieve it and I can get you to him.</Description>
