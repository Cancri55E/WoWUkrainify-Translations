  <Title>Helping Out, Somewhere Else</Title>
  <Description>You've been a big help and now we've got a lot of gold to divvy up!   

You should go west to Seabreeze Village. Treat it like a vacation, keep your mind off the gold. We'll be fine here. When you come back later, we'll have your share all ready for you.

You'd just be getting in the way here.</Description>
