  <Title>Cry Wolf</Title>
  <Description>Lately, the wolves have been terrorizing my flock. They weren't an issue until the giants moved in and pushed them out of their normal hunting grounds.

I feel bad asking you to do this, but could you thin their ranks a bit? If there are fewer wolves competing for food, maybe they'll leave us alone.</Description>
