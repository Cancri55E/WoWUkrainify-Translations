  <Title>There's Gold in Them There Fields</Title>
  <Description>We've still got some folks missing, and I could use your help finding them.$b$bWhile Brennadam is now secure, I worry for some of our farms closer to the quilboar kraul. We relied on the militia in the past to keep the quilboar back, but now that they've retreated to the east I worry that our outlying farms are in danger.$b$bGoldfield's farm is almost directly south of us, up the hill by the falls. While it's not surprising that he hasn't left, I would feel better if you checked in.</Description>
