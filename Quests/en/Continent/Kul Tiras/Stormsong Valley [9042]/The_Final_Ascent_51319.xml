  <Title>The Final Ascent</Title>
  <Description>Beyond this gate lies Lord Stormsong... and our retribution. It seems he has sealed it tight, likely to buy himself time to finish whatever foul ritual awaits us.

Release the souls within the Dead Ringer when you are ready. I will direct them into the binding holding the gate shut.

From there, we find Stormsong and end this once and for all.</Description>
