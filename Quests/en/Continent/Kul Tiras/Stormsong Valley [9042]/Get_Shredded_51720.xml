  <Title>Get Shredded</Title>
  <Description>I was scouting ahead while you were wreaking havoc in the mine.

Spotted a hulking, armored shredder in their lumber yard. Bet we could do some real damage with that thing! 

I tried to start it up, but looks like it might be out of juice. Maybe they forgot to charge it?

See if you can grab a fresh power core from one of the other shredders nearby.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find an Energized Power Core and install it in the Prototype Shredder MK-03.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Energized Core required.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;As the key clicks into place and the new core activates, a low hum begins emitting from the shredder. It accelerates into a high pitched whirring as the instrument panels light up all over the cockpit.&gt;</RewardText>
