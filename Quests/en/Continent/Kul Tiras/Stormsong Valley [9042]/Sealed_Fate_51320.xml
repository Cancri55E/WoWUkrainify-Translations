  <Title>Sealed Fate</Title>
  <Description>Three wards ahead threaten to block our entry into the Shrine. We call them the Tidemother's Wrath, Radiance, and Pride.

Legends say the wards were gifts from the sea itself. They once protected our flagships against even the fiercest storms. Ever since we settled here they have instead kept the Shrine of the Storm safe.

It seems Lord Stormsong has turned their power against us. I can feel their energy radiating out even from here, protecting his forces from our magic.

We must destroy them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy the Tidemother's Wrath, Tidemother's Radiance, and Tidemother's Pride.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I can feel the wards' power waning even now. This is our chance to strike.</RewardText>
