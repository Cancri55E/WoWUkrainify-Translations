  <Description>These k'thir have been hiding among us, sowing the seeds of their dark masters with us none the wiser.

With the barrier around the Abyssal Melody lowered I can peer within; its bowels toil with my own people giving themselves to the shadow!

Take my tidal kris; its blade is now coated in purified tideblood. Put an end to these fiends and their foul rituals.</Description>
