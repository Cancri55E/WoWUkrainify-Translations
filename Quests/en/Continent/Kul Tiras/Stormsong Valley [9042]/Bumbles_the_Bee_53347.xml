  <Title>Bumbles the Bee</Title>
  <Description>Hey $p, thanks for delivering Mom's letter. I was really starting to worry about her!

Dad and I have been having a few problems running the farm after she left on her trip. If you didn't show up when you did, we'd still be in real trouble!

I was hoping you would be willing to help Bumbles out too. He was hurt when his hive was destoyed.

If we feed him some of Dad's special formula, hopefully he will heal up faster. First we need to find the secret ingredient, try looking around at his other lab.</Description>
