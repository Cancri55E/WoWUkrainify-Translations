  <Title>Be A Dear</Title>
  <Description>As you can plainly see by the rocks falling from the sky, we are under siege by those terrible ettins!

If you could be obliged to lend us a hand, I'd be most grateful. We can't possibly hope to defeat them unless we properly prepare you first.

Could you be a dear and fetch a few things for me from around the Hamlet? Some water, a sack of flour, and a bundle of logs should help.

I've already sent my grandson, Charles, off to fetch a few other items. I've not seen him for quite a while though.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect a Water Bucket, Sack of Flour, and Logs, then return them to Marie Davenport.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you so much. I wish Charles was half as studious as you.</RewardText>
