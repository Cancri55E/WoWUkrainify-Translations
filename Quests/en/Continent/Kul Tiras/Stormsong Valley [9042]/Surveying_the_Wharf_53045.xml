  <Title>Surveying the Wharf</Title>
  <Description>Thresher's Wharf is a bustling fishing hub just across the delta from Fort Daelin. 

It was also in the direct war path of the naga -- who knows what remains now.

If you could stop in and check in on its leader, Coxswain Hook, you'd have my gratitude. I must focus on tending to the wounded here and preparing for the naga's next assault.</Description>
