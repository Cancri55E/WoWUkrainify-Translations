  <Title>Fun With Magnets</Title>
  <Description>My last time in Tol Barad I had to leave in a big hurry, but I grabbed a few gadgets on the way out.  

This device is one of my favorites, so don't break it! It'll suck the treasure right out of the mud. It may make you tingle some, that's just the radiation.

Find lost coins using the metal collector near the signs I've placed.</Description>
