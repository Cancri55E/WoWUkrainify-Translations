  <Title>The Black Sheep</Title>
  <Description>I'll admit, Millie has never really been one to follow the herd. Usually, it's no problem. She'll wander off for a bit, do her own thing and eventually make her way back to the flock.

The hills have grown increasingly more dangerous lately, especially with the wolves and giants about. She's been gone awhile and I'm starting to worry.

Could you please help me look for her?</Description>

  <RewardText>Oh, my sweet Millie! Thank you, $n. I'm in your debt.</RewardText>
