  <Title>Beneath the Veil</Title>
  <Description>We must board the Abyssal Melody and save the myriad souls in her decks before they too disappear into the Shrine. We will not be able to enter so long as the barrier surrounding it stands.

The tidesages are using forbidden magic to summon extensions of their will. It is these grasps that maintain the barrier.

Take my beacon and mark each grasp. I will rain vengeance down upon them from here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Abyssal Beacon to dispel the Writhing Grasps.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have the grasps been dealt with?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The Abyssal Melody lies unprotected. Now is our chance.</RewardText>
