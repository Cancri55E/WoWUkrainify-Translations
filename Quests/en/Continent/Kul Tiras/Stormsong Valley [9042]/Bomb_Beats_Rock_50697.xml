  <Description>I stole an old treasure map off an Irontide pirate. The map marks several caves on it with circles. 

The caves are blocked by boulders, but now that you're here, we're going to open them up.

You get to do all the dangerous stuff, plant explosives, kill things, and cave exploring.  I'll supervise.</Description>
