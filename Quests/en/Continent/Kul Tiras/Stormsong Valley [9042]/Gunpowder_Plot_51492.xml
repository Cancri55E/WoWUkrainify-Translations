  <Title>Gunpowder Plot</Title>
  <Description>Granny has everyone out running errands trying to put our hamlet back in order.

I don't know what to do. The rats have gotten into our stores, they're eating everything in sight.

I tried prodding one of them to get it to move along, it started foaming at the mouth, then it exploded! 

Think I know where all the gunpowder went...

If you recover any, can you please take it back to Marie?</Description>
