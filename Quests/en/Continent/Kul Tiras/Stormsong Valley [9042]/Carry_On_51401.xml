  <Description>Let's get to Brennadam right away. We need to find Brother Pike and get to the bottom of all of this before things get any worse.

This road should take us right into town. Brennadam's the busiest market this side of Boralus, so there should be plenty of people there who can help us find Pike.

Ready when you are!</Description>
