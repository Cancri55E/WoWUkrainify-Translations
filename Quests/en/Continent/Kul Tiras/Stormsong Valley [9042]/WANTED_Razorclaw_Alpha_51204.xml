  <Title>WANTED: Razorclaw Alpha</Title>
  <Description>Adventurers Needed!

The wolves have been attacking my flock! I don't have the means to fight them back.

I've seen one, much larger than the rest, leading a few of the attacks.

Please, if anyone can help, I'll gladly offer whatever reward I can muster.
