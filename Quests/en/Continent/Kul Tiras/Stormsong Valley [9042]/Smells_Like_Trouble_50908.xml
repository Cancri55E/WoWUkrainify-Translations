  <Title>Smells Like Trouble</Title>
  <Description>The Horde spilled a lot of blood in Brennadam. Now it's time to spill some more.

The scent of blood makes predators in these hills go crazy. We use it to lure animals when hunting.  

The Horde forces are occupying caves up in the hills. Toss these scent vials into the caves where the Force Commanders organize the attack. The smell should bring all the hills down upon them!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Force Commanders Ogarth and Durmok.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Those scent vials should help you eliminate both Force Commanders.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>With you around, they won't try this again.</RewardText>
