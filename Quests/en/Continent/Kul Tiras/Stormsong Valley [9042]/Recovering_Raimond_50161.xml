  <Title>Recovering Raimond</Title>
  <Description>The map we found earlier had some red markings, near the flower field. 

Do you think you could go up there and look for dad?

I'm going to stay here and check out the rest of this stuff. 

I'd go with you... but, I'm sort of allergic to bees.

Oh, and take his boot. Just in case!</Description>
