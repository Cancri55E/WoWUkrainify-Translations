  <Title>Freedom for the Sea</Title>
  <Description>The naga along this coast appear to be trying to push the shoreline up the hill here. We've been able to keep them back at the beach so far, but they've been binding more elementals than we can keep up with.

Without a tidesage, we have no way to free the elementals from their bindings, but we cannot allow them to push forward anymore. The spirit of the sea should not be contained by anything. Slay them, and let them return to the ocean.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay $1oa Bound Seasurges.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>For a people that live in the sea, the naga seem to have little respect for it.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That should slow down their progress quite a bit. You have my gratitude.</RewardText>
