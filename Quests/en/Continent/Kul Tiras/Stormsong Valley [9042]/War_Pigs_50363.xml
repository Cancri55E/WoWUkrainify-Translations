  <Title>War Pigs</Title>
  <Description>They look cute enough now, but that's a new herd of battleboars in training.$b$bFarmers don't like waste, and it would be a shame to get rid of such useful creatures.$b$bEither way, we could use those pigs, and I'd rather have them with us rather than face a bloodthirsty one in a few years. You should find them up on top of the cliffs overlooking the center of the kraul. Go round up as many piglets as you can take with you and we'll make good use of them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Grazing Battle-Piglets.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We can use them for labor, food, and even pets!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I will take these and make sure they get to the farms for proper training.</RewardText>
