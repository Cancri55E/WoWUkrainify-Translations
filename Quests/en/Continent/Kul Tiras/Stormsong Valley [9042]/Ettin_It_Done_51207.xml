  <Title>Ettin It Done</Title>
  <Description>Okay, now here's a little something I whipped up for you with those extra ingredients.

We don't have much around here in the way of weapons, but we've got gunpowder and plenty of flour. A surprisingly explosive combination!

Toss one of these goodies at those nasty ettins, should disorient them long enough to give 'em a good whack upside the head!

You thought I was just a sweet old lady, baking delicious cookies for any ol' passerby? Hah, I'll have you know I was quite the firecracker in my day.</Description>
