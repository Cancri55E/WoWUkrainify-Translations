  <Title>...And Following Seas</Title>
  <Description>My brother Derek died in the Second War, only to be raised against his will by the Banshee Queen. If not for Baine Bloodhoof's courageous act of defiance, Derek would have been turned into a weapon against my family.

He's lived in torment since his awakening. I feared he would be lost to us, but he has received help from an old friend of mine who has also been recently raised--Calia Menethil. She has guided him back from the brink of despair.

I am on my way to pay them a visit. Care to join me?</Description>
