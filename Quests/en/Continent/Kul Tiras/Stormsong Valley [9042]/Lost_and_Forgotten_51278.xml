  <Description>We have seen firsthand the depravity that has taken hold of my former brethren. The time has come to put an end to it.

The path ahead is no doubt packed with Lord Stormsong's cultists and their soulwrought elementals. I will absorb their souls as they fall with the Dead Ringer, as you once did.

However, there will be no release for these fiends... not this time. We will need them to pry open the final door to the Shrine.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Fill the Dead Ringer with souls.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Mourn not for the fallen. We do what we must to save our people.</RewardText>
