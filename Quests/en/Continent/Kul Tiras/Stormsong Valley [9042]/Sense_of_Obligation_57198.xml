  <Description>Derek is free. I have to atone for much with him.

There is a rumor of a meeting with Jaina and her brother.

Head to Seabreeze Village in Stormsong Valley. I hope there you will be able to find out... well, let's just say I am trying to keep the bigger picture in focus.

If you find out anything of interest, I would be most appreciative.

For now, let's keep this between the two of us.</Description>
