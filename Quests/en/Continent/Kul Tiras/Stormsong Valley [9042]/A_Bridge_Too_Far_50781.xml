  <Title>A Bridge Too Far</Title>
  <Description>The bridge that once crossed this span is the only land route to the Shrine. 

It appears Lord Stormsong has sealed it to buy himself more time. We have been attempting to reopen the way to no avail.

However, the Rod of Tides you recovered may prove our solace. Veteran tideguards use it as a key of sorts to maintain the Path of Storms across these dangerous waters.

We will begin the ritual once more... if you will wield the rod.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Rod of Tides to open the Path of Storms.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The way is opened at last.</RewardText>
