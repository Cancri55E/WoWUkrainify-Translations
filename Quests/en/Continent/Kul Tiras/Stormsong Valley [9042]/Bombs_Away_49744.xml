  <Title>Bombs, Away</Title>
  <Description>By the sea's foamy beard, what a blast!$b$bThey've brought goblins, and if there's one thing I know about goblins it's that they like to blow things up.$b$bI saw a few of them carrying large bombs, and I presume that they are going to blow up the town. I would like to keep the town, so how about you head out there and steal as many of those explosives as you can find? After that, let's blow up their demolishers and stop this infernal bombardment!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve $1oa Horde Explosives and use them against the Demolishers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Don't forget to check inside the buildings too!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These look particularly nasty. I'm glad they aren't blowing up in our faces.</RewardText>
