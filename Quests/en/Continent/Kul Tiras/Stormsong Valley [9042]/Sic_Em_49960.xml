  <Description>Humphrey's a good tracker, to be sure. He's also the orneriest, angriest, most dogged dog if he sets his eyes on a quilboar. This will certainly be useful.$b$bBelow our very noses, the foreman organizes and directs the tunnelers to cause the most mayhem and destruction. If you can put an end to him, it should make things a lot easier for us to move around the farmlands.$b$bHumphrey looks a bit hungry, wouldn't you say? Why don't you bring him with you to take care of business?</Description>
