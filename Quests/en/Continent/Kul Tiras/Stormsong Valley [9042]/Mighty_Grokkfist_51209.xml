  <Title>Mighty Grokkfist</Title>
  <Description>Grandma is always telling me I need to toughen up a little... how easy we've got it these days.

I read a story about giants that are terrified of rats, so I thought, "Hey Charles, here's a great idea, let's take all those rats $p gathered and let 'em loose on the ettins."

I tried to be tough for once, but look how it turned out. Now, I'm stuck out here, just hoping I don't get squashed.

Their leader is just up the hill there. Here, take the rats with you and let's hope I was right!</Description>
