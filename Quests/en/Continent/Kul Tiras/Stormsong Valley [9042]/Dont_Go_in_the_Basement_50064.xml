  <Title>Don't Go in the Basement</Title>
  <Description>We checked everywhere... well, &lt;gulps&gt; everywhere except the basement.

B-b-but, dad told me never to go down there.

He said it's dark, scary, and dangerous to go alone... I could be eaten by a brue!

I don't even know what that is, but I don't wanna be eaten! 

$n, do you think you could go down first?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Enter the basement.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The brue, I saw it. He didn't make it up!!</RewardText>
