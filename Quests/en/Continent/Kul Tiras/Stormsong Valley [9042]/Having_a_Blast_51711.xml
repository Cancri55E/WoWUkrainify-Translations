  <Title>Having a Blast</Title>
  <Description>We're going to really hit 'em where it hurts, $p.

They're carting tons of black powder right out of that mine. This could end very badly for all of us if we don't do something.

The mines are relatively undefended, I bet you can get in and wipe out their workers before they realize what's happening.

Keep an eye out for some explosives, if we can use their own tools against them, even better!</Description>
