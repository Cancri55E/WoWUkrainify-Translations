  <Title>Free the Farmhands</Title>
  <Description>We were running around trying to get the farm under control, but the bees, oh my goodness, the bees!

The giant monstrosities came out of nowhere and started dousing everyone in honey.

I came up here to find Raimond, but before I knew it, I was covered too. 

Then, the strangest thing happened, the honey started growing around me!

Please, the other farmhands are still in trouble, you've got to help them!</Description>
