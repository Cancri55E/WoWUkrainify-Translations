  <Title>Felspine the Greater</Title>
  <Description>Gnomus knows about the massive diemetradon and plans to eat it! He must have been able to see what I could see through the eyes of his arcano-scorp. Look, there's no time to explain. He's crazy and that craziness is going to cost us the closest thing we've got to a fireproof jumpsuit.$B$BGet back to the lava flow near Baa'ri and track down Felspine the Greater. Once you find it, kill it and bring me back its hide.$B$BDon't try and reason with me, $n. I'm well past that point.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Researcher Tiorus at Shadowmoon Village in Shadowmoon Valley wants you to kill Felspine the Greater and recover Felspine's Hide.
