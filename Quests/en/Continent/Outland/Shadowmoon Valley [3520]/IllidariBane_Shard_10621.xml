  <Title>Illidari-Bane Shard</Title>
  <Description>The shard appears to be a piece of a larger weapon. Sharp-looking runes etched into the metal glow with a menacing light.$B$BThe weapon's intended purpose isn't clear to you, but it's hard to ignore. Most of the mo'arg at Legion Hold seem to be working with fragments of the same metal you hold in your hand. Perhaps one of the weaponsmiths at Wildhammer Stronghold might be able to tell you more about it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Illidari-Bane Shard to Ordinn Thunderfist at Wildhammer Stronghold.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What have you got there?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Ordinn accepts the weapon fragment from you.&gt;$B$BI haven't seen something like this in a long time. Sure, it's made from a rare ore, but this is destined for no mundane weapon, $n. It's infused with a magic intended to destroy demons. If you obtained this from the Legion, it must be some kind of 'secret weapon' they're planning to deploy against Illidan. What a find!</RewardText>
