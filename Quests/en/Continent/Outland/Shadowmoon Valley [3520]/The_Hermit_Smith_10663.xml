  <Title>The Hermit Smith</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The orc shakes his head at his failure.&gt;$B$BThis is beyond my ability, but that's not to say the weapon can't be recreated.$B$BIt pains me to suggest this, but your only hope may be a human smith by the name of David Wayne. It's true he was once a member of the Alliance's expedition, but that was a long time ago and he has since left the Sons of Lothar. These days, he lives in a small camp on a peninsula east of Firewing Point in Terokkar Forest. Take the ingots to him and see if he can help you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Box of Ingots to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge in Terokkar Forest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What brings you here, $C? I don't get many visitors.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The smith frowns and examines the ingots.&gt;$B$BI'll be frank with you, $C. I'm a relic of an age when cooperation with the Horde was unthinkable.$B$BI am not so blind as to see that we do not have common enemies. I will help you to reforge the anti-demon weapon but it's going to take a lot of hard work and a few 'exotic' resources.</RewardText>
