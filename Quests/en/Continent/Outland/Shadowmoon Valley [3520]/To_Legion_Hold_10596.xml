  <Title>To Legion Hold</Title>
  <Description>The fortress of Legion Hold is your target. You'll have no reinforcements, so a frontal attack is out of the question.$B$BWhat little information we have shows that the Legion stocks and prepares its infernals at the hold. With the help of a disguise I'll give you, you must sneak into Legion Hold and discover their plans.$B$BYour best hope is to intercept or overhear communication between their commanders. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Make your way to Legion Hold, locate the Legion Communication Device, and learn about the Legion's plans while in disguise. Return to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village when you've completed your mission.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What did you discover?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>What do you mean they're going to step up the bombardment? We can't allow that to happen. Get back out there and take care of it while there's something left of Shadowmoon Village!</RewardText>
