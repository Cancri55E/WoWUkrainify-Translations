  <Title>Underworld Loam</Title>
  <Description>The frame that you brought me earlier will not be sufficient to hold molten metal without reinforcement. A rare kind of earth can be used to cool and imbue the frame, giving the adamantite an unnatural strength.$B$BUnderworld loam, as the earth is known, is accorded great value among the naga. Few enough of them possess it, and in Outland, I know of only one naga who uses it -- Hydromancer Thespia, who resides in the Steamvault of Coilfang Reservoir.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Get a Vial of Underworld Loam from Hydromancer Thespia and bring it to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you secured the underworld loam?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This should do the trick. I'd hoped for a bit more, but to be honest, we were lucky to get our hands on any at all out here.</RewardText>
