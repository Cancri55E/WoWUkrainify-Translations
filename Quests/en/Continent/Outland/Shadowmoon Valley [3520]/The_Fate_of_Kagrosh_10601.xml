  <Title>The Fate of Kagrosh</Title>
  <Description>The scouting party originally had three members. Unfortunately, Kagrosh decided he wanted to be a hero.$B$BHe descended into the Deathforge and we haven't heard from him since.$B$BIn all likelihood, the fool's gone and gotten himself killed. The Shadow Council members aren't idiots and Kagrosh wasn't exactly strong in the subtlety department, if you know what I mean. Keep an eye out for him in the Deathforge and recover any information or items he might have collected.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Scout Zagran at Slag Watch wants you to search the Deathforge for Kagrosh and recover Kagrosh's Pack.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find any sign of Kagrosh in the Deathforge?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Zagran shakes his head as he accepts the pack from you&gt;$B$BI told you he was a fool. I hope there's something in here that justifies the time you spent searching for him.</RewardText>
