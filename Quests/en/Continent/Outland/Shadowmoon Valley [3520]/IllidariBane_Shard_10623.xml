  <Title>Illidari-Bane Shard</Title>
  <Description>The shard appears to be a piece of a larger weapon. Sharp-looking runes etched into the metal glow with a menacing light.$B$BThe weapon's intended purpose isn't clear to you, but it's hard to ignore. Most of the mo'arg at Legion Hold seem to be working with fragments of the same metal you hold in your hand. Perhaps one of the weaponsmiths at Shadowmoon Village might be able to tell you more about it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Illidari-Bane Shard to Grokom Deatheye at Shadowmoon Village.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What have you got there?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Grokom accepts the weapon fragment from you.&gt;$B$BI haven't seen this in years. Not only is it made from a rare ore. but it's not about to be used in an ordinary weapon, $N.$B$BThese runes imbue the blade with the power to obliterate demons. This shows how much the Legion hates Illidan, if they're willing to arm their own troops with demon-destroying weapons. We could use this to our advantage.</RewardText>
