  <Title>Building a Better Gryphon</Title>
  <Description>I've heard that the Wildhammer dwarves maintain a gryphon roost at their fortress down in southern Shadowmoon Valley. If you're going down there, would you speak to them on my behalf? I have some ideas on how to improve their gryphons!$B$BWhy stop at armoring them when you could attach an altimeter, a rear view mirror, and rocket? Imagine how fast you could go with one of those babies strapped to your gryphon's back! I'll call it the TurboGryphon 8000!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Brunn Flamebeard at Wildhammer Stronghold in Shadowmoon Valley.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Brunn's face reddens until its color is indistinguishable from his beard.&gt;$B$BHe wants to do WHAT to my gryphons?$B$BIf that little pipsqueak puts anything other than a saddle on them, I'll personally travel up to Blade's Edge and stuff that rocket o' his down his throat!</RewardText>
