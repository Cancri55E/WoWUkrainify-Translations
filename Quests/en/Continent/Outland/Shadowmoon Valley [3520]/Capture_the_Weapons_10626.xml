  <Title>Capture the Weapons</Title>
  <Description>With a larger supply of this material, we might be able to forge a weapon for you to use.$B$BThe two pit lords at Legion Hold, Makazradon and Morgroron, have already been equipped with these anti-demon weapons. We have no way of knowing how many more the Legion intends to produce, but if we can capture these prototypes, there should be enough for our project.$B$B&lt;Ordinn grins.&gt;$B$BThere's a certain amount of satisfaction in using the Legion's own 'secret weapons' against them, don't you think?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ordinn Thunderfist at Wildhammer Stronghold wants you to bring him Mazakradon's Glaive and Morgroron's Glaive.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you capture those prototypes?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These should work nicely. Now, let's forge them into a more useful form.</RewardText>
