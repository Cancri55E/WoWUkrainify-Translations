  <Title>The Lexicon Demonica</Title>
  <Description>Recreating the enchantments on the blade requires several spells to be spoken in demonic.$B$BIt's not something I was taught during my training as an apprentice, but there's no way around it. There's a book, called the Lexicon Demonica, that will provide most of the words I need, but it's in the hands of a powerful Shadow Council warlock.$B$BDeep in the halls of Auchindoun's Shadow Labyrinth, it is held by Grandmaster Vorpil. Do whatever you must to secure the book and bring it to me. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Lexicon Demonica from Grandmaster Vorpil and bring it to David Wayne at Wayne's Refuge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you retrieved the book?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;David leafs through the book's pages, shuddering.&gt;$B$BThis is not something to be trifled with, $n. After the weapon is created, I will destroy it. There is enough demonic power about in the world without this text out in the open.</RewardText>
