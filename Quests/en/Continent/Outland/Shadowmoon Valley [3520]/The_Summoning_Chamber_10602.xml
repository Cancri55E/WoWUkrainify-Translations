  <Title>The Summoning Chamber</Title>
  <Description>In order to churn out infernals as quickly as the Deathforge seems to, they must have an area dedicated to summoning the elementals that form the core of the infernals.$B$BThe summoning chamber is likely to be found below ground, near a pool of fouled water or lava. Locate the summoning chamber within the Deathforge and find a way to end their summoning ritual. The mo'arg involved in making the infernals may carry a tool that will help disrupt the summoner's magics.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain an Elemental Displacer from a Deathforge Smith or Deathforge Tinkerer and use it to disrupt the ritual in the summoning chamber. Report to Scout Zagran at Slag Watch when you've completed your task.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We cannot afford to let their production continue. Have you put an end to the summoning ritual?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good, we're making progress. That puts us one step closer to shutting down this facility and returning safely to Shadowmoon Village.</RewardText>
