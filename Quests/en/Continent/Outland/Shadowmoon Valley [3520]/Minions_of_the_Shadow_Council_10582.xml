  <Title>Minions of the Shadow Council</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Ewan listens to you recount the events at Legion Hold, nodding.&gt;$B$BThat puts our observations into perspective. We've caught glimpses of them launching infernals in the direction of the hold, but haven't been able to find much more than that.$B$BThe Shadow Council has the Deathforge sealed tighter than a new keg o' thunderbrew. The first thing you'll need to do is crack some skulls so you can get in there and poke around. Start eliminating the Shadow Council guarding the entrance to the Deathforge!</Description>

  <CompletionText>Have you cleared a way into the Deathforge yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I wish I could've been out there with you! I've been itching to put my hammer to use, but my mission is to observe, not to kill.$B$BNow that you've punched a hole in their defenses, let's get to work on shutting down production in the Deathforge.</RewardText>
