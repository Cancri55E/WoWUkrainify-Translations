  <Title>Kroghan's Report</Title>
  <Description>My original orders were to remain in Garadar for a short time, then continue on and report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village. What I've seen in my time here is that Garadar could benefit from a long term Horde liaison.$B$BI know that Blood Guard Gulmok needs all the troops he can get, but I know he'll understand that my mission here isn't yet complete. Travel to Shadowmoon Village, in northwestern Shadowmoon Valley, and inform Blood Guard Gulmok of my delayed arrival.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.</LogDescription>
