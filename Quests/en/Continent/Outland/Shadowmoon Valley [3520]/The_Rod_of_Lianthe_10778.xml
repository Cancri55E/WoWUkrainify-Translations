  <Title>The Rod of Lianthe</Title>
  <Description>The totem alone is not strong enough to counteract the sinister magics of the dark conclave.$B$BWe can combine it with other objects of power, forming a staff to focus the energies. We cannot rescue my brethren from the depths of their depravity, but we can stop them.$B$BOne of the items I need for the staff is the Rod of Lianthe, held by the blood elves at Eclipse Point to the southeast. It is kept in a pavilion on the top tier of the ruins and will be heavily guarded. Use caution, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain Lianthe's Key from any of the blood elves at Eclipse Point and use it to open Lianthe's Strongbox and claim the Rod of Lianthe. Return the rod to Parshah in the Magma Fields.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you manage to get the rod?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done. Such a treasure deserves better than to be shut away in a dark chest. We shall see it used for a worthy purpose.</RewardText>
