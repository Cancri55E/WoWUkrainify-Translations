  <Title>The Fate of Flanis</Title>
  <Description>Wing Commander Nuainn originally sent three of us out here to keep watch over the Deathforge and to gather information. Flanis Swiftwing volunteered to try to infiltrate the Deathforge, but we haven't heard anything from him in days.$B$BI fear the worst, $n. Flanis is a skilled scout, but if he's gotten in over his head, we have no way of knowing. Search the Deathforge for him and recover any information or items he might have collected.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Stormer Ewan Wildwing at Deathforge Tower wants you to search the Deathforge for Flanis Swiftwing and recover Flanis's Pack.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find any sign of Flanis in the Deathforge?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Ewan shakes his head as he accepts the pack from you&gt;$B$BI don't think Flanis realized how heavily guarded the Deathforge would be. Now that we know what's really going on there, I don't blame them. I just wish Flanis had known that when he went in.$B$BI can only hope there's something here that will help us shut down the Deathforge once and for all.</RewardText>
