  <Title>Blast the Infernals!</Title>
  <Description>The device we've assembled won't win any beauty contests, but it should be capable of destroying the infernals amassed at Legion Hold. Judging from what the fel reaver power core's energy did to the Fetid Pool, it holds a respectable amount of explosive power.$B$BIf you set the device off in the middle of the green glyph at the hold, it should be in range to hit all of the infernals.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Fel Bomb while standing on the green glyph in Legion Hold to destroy the infernals, then report to Blood Guard Gulmok at Shadowmoon Village.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you found a way to destroy the Legion's infernal stockpile?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is no time for celebration, $N. We're not out of the fire yet. I've got new orders for you.</RewardText>
