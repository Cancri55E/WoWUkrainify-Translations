  <Title>Sketh'lon Feathers</Title>
  <Description>There is one last element missing from the staff. We must direct the staff's power toward the Dark Conclave spirits.$B$BWe can do that by gathering feathers scattered on the ground at the Sketh'lon Base Camp and using them in the staff. The base camp is to the south, east of Wildhammer Stronghold.$B$BGul'dan's magic utterly destroyed my brethren, leaving only their spirits, but it did not stop there. The magic fed on the spell the arakkoa were preparing, forging a sinister force that engulfed the spirits.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 8 Sketh'lon Feathers and bring them to Parshah in the Magma Fields.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you gathered the feathers for the staff?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Parshah accepts the ash-dusted feathers, shaking his head.&gt;$B$BIt would've been better if they had died that day, but nothing is ever that simple. That Gul'dan's magic would turn them into the kind of threat they tried to stop is a particularly cruel twist of fate.</RewardText>
