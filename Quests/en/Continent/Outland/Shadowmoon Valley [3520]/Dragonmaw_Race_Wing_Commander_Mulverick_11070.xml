The amount of crying that a hardened soldier does when it comes down to all-out war is amazing!$B$B"They're jumping into our tower with their horses!" "Why is their base so well defended?" "They're taking our relief hut, I'm going A.W.O.L.!"$B$BWimps...$B$BI took the first train out of "cry-town" the minute the Dark Portal opened. Now I'm a top gun for the Dragonmaw. If you want to be top orc, you'll have to defeat me.$B$BWe go when you are ready.
