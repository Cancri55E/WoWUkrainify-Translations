  <Title>Fresh from the Mechanar</Title>
  <Description>Working with the ingots you brought is going to require a lot of heat -- rather more than a conventional forge can supply.$B$BI'm going to need a supplemental heat source for the forge and there are very few things in Outland that can supply that kind of power.$B$BThe Mechanar area of Tempest Keep turns out manacells containing an incredible amount of power. Find one of the overcharged manacells from the stacks around Mechano-Lord Capacitus and bring it back here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>David Wayne at Wayne's Retreat wants you to bring him an Overcharged Manacell.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to smuggle a manacell out of the Mechanar.</CompletionText>
