  <Title>The Summoning Chamber</Title>
  <Description>In order for the Shadow Council to construct infernals as quickly as they're being used, they must have an area dedicated to summoning the corrupted elementals that serve as the souls of the creatures.$B$BThe summoning chamber is likely to be found below ground, near a pool of fouled water or lava. Locate the summoning chamber within the Deathforge and find a way to end their summoning ritual. The mo'arg involved in making the infernals may carry a tool that will help disrupt the summoner's magics.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain an Elemental Displacer from a Deathforge Smith or Deathforge Tinkerer and use it to disrupt the ritual in the summoning  chamber. Report to Stormer Ewan Wildwing at the Deathforge Tower when you've completed your task.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We cannot afford to let their production continue. Have you put an end to the summoning ritual?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n. Disrupting the Shadow Council's summoning puts us one step closer to shutting down the Deathforge.</RewardText>
