  <Description>Don't let your guard down, $r. We're under constant assault from the Burning Legion.$B$BFrom their base of Legion Hold to the northwest, the demons rain down a ceaseless stream of infernals. As quickly as we can kill them, the new meteors impact and begin a new wave of attacks.$B$BMy men are ragged and exhausted. I don't know how much longer they'll hold out. Please, $n, lend your help to our defenses. Take your place on the line and halt the advance of the infernals!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wing Commander Nuainn, outside of Wildhammer Stronghold, wants you to kill 10 Infernal Attackers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you tired already, $c?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for relieving my men, $n. With your help, and that of others, we may yet hold out. Unfortunately, merely holding out is not enough. We must go on the offensive.</RewardText>
