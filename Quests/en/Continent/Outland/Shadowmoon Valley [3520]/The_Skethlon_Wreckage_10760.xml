  <Title>The Sketh'lon Wreckage</Title>
  <Description>The Sketh'lon Wreckage, just to the east, is an eerie place. The peons are convinced that it's cursed.$B$BThere are few trees here, so the peons have no choice but to venture into the arakkoa ruins to chop wood. The arakkoa spirits prey on the work groups, draining their life and using it to fuel their foul magics.$B$BWe must find out what is driving the dark conclave and stop them before their influence expands. Search the Sketh'lon Wreckage for evidence of their plans.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover the Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 1, Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 2, and Skethlon Commander's Journal Page 3 from the Dark Conclave arakkoa at the Sketh'lon Wreckage to Sergeant Kargrul at Shadowmoon Village.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What have you discovered?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I don't see much of use here, but there are a couple of entries that could prove useful. It looks as though these arakkoa were preparing some kind of elaborate magical ritual up until the time of their deaths, but why? There's also a curious note here about a 'deserter.'</RewardText>
