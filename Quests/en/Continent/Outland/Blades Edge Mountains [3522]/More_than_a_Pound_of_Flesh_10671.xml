  <Title>More than a Pound of Flesh</Title>
  <Description>$n, I've got something else for you to do.  One of the eggheads wants to study the fiendling flesh beasts that can be found at Razaan's Landing, north of the Razor Ridge.$B$BMore to the point, they want to study the flesh of the flesh beasts that are there.$B$B&lt;Dizzy makes a disgusted face.&gt;$B$BBut, of course, they aren't willing to get their hands dirty, and they only want the ether-energized flesh, which it's not likely that all of them have.$B$BI say, beggars can't be choosers, but what can you do?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 5 Ether-Energized Flesh.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You have my pound of flesh?  What, you didn't think that was funny?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These ought to do nicely.  Don't they stink, though?$B$BI hope that this is worth your troubles... I'm just glad that it was you collecting this stuff instead of me!</RewardText>
