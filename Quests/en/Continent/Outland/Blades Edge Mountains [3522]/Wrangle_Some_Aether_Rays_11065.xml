  <Description>Wanna help the Skyguard and Ogri'la?$B$BJust hear me out before you walk away, $g hot stuff : girly;.  We're in need of remounts!

You don't even have to bring them back here, though that would be nice.  Just break and rope them, and we'll track them down later.$B$BThink you can wrangle me up some?</Description>
