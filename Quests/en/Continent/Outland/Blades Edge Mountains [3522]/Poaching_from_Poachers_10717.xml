  <Title>Poaching from Poachers</Title>
  <Description>Pardon me, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with Chawn.  I'd like to help.$B$BI'm studying the Blackwing Coven, and helping the druids in their dealings with them.$B$BI am very interested in acquiring a few of their dragon whelps; it would help us to gauge exactly what we're up against by understanding that which they revere.$B$BBut first, we're going to need to acquire some nets.  I noticed that the wyrmcult poachers out in the Ruuan Weald have an abundance of them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 5 Wyrmcult Nets.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How's the procurement of nets coming along?  From what I've seen, those nets that the poachers use should be strong enough for the task at hand.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Oh, those look splendid.  These cultists certainly have an eye for craftsmanship.$B$BToo bad for them that it's misdirected.$B$BAnd now that we have the nets, would you be willing to help little old me with a thing or two?</RewardText>
