  <Title>Bomb Them Again!</Title>
  <Description>We're still having problems with those flak cannons, $n.$B$BDon't get me wrong -- I think that you did an outstanding job the last time out -- but, that doesn't change the fact that those damned demons seem to be replenishing their ammo supplies faster than we can knock them out.  And that means we're having a hell of a time getting our people through there, not to mention the risk those demons pose to Ogri'la.$B$BWhat do you say?  Want to take another shot at it?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Skyguard Bombs to destroy 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How goes the bombing run?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Outstanding work, $n!  I'd have you back up in the air and bombing them again, but policy around here is to make sure that our pilots get plenty of R&amp;R.  Sorry, I don't make the rules, but I sure as hell enforce them!$B$BSee you again tomorrow, Ace!</RewardText>
