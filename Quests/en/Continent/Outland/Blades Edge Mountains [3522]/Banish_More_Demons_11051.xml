  <Title>Banish More Demons</Title>
  <Description>If we know the demons, and we do because we've studied them extensively, they're fast at work repairing any damage that has been done to their precious transporter.$B$BSo, if you want a chance at another darkrune, take our banishing crystal back out there and eliminate more demons.  Besides, you want to help us to lessen the threat that the demons pose, yes?$B$BWe said "chance" because the process we use yields mixed results.  You might get a darkrune, or you might get something else entirely.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Banishing Crystal to banish 15 demons at Forge Camp: Wrath or Forge Camp: Terror.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>A seasoned pro such as yourself shouldn't be having any difficulty banishing demons.  You're not having any difficulties, right, $r?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We wish the process of creating a darkrune was foolproof, $N.  Alas, it is not.  Please, take this bag and look in it to see what we've wrought today.  We couldn't bear to look ourselves.$B$BRemember, if you get a darkrune, take it to Gahk to exchange for a crystalforged darkrune.  Then you'll be able to once more bring down Shartuul's transporter.$B$BOh, and $N, don't forget to come by again tomorrow and pickup the banishing crystal.  There are always more demons to be banished.</RewardText>
