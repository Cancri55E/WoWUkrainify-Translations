  <Title>Silkwing Cocoons</Title>
  <Description>The silk from the cocoons of the silkwings are used for all manner of things in the village. We can never get enough, and we never have enough.$b$bIt is difficult to harvest the cocoons from the larva once they begin the process of metamorphosis.$b$bOur warriors are occupied with the assault on our village. If you could gather these for us, that would be helpful.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 8 Silkwing Cocoons from Silkwing Larva.$b$bKill the Larva quickly or they will turn into Silkwings, ruining their cocoons.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>A swift and sure hand is needed for the harvesting. I hope you will be successful.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good quality cocoons, these. I can see you've gotten the hang of harvesting them.$B$BWe have experimented with trying to raise our own silkwing larva, but unfortunately the small ones do not produce enough silk to be of use to us.</RewardText>
