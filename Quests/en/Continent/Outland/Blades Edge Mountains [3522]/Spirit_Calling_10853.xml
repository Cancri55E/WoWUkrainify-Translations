  <Title>Spirit Calling</Title>
  <Description>The spirits of the nether drakes in the Singing Ridge are in need of liberation.$B$BThe nether drakes were not always nether drakes.  They used to be black drakes.$B$BBut then, with the destruction of this world, a wave of nether energy washed over everything and had the side-effect of changing the drakeling eggs.$B$BNow they are all twisted versions of their former selves.  We must help them to find peace.$B$BDo this by slaying a drake near to the spirit calling totem, and then take its spirit from it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Spirit Calling Totems to collect 8 Lesser Nether Drake Spirits.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The drakes of the Singing Ridge may pose a threat to us, but I think they are majestic creatures.$B$BOr, at least they were.  I hope that you will be able to save their spirits.$B$BAnd if you are in need of more totems, I have a few to spare.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You have done a good thing this day, $C.  The spirits of the drakes will truly sing again now that they have been freed.  And the residual part of their spirits that they leave behind are powerful medicine, too.$B$BI wonder, are you up for a journey to the north?  There is something that I am curious about concerning the activities of the ethereal.$B$BI sense a great deal of pain coming from their direction.</RewardText>
