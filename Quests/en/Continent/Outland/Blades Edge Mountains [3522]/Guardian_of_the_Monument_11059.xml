  <Title>Guardian of the Monument</Title>
  <Description>You've figured out how to use the single-person relics, but as you may have seen, there are bigger ones, which they surround.$B$BThese larger apexis monuments function in much the same way, but they take 35 apexis shards to activate.$B$BOf greater concern to us are the guardians that are summoned through their use.  These crystal constructs turned on their arakkoan masters long ago, and now endanger Ogri'la.$B$BWe would ask that you destroy one and bring us proof.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect an Apexis Guardian's Head.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We abhor violence, but at least the construct that we have sent you against isn't a living being.$B$BSpeaking of which, do you have the head?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Chu'a'lor beams at you with obvious respect.&gt;$B$BNot only are we impressed with the mental alacrity of you and your friends, but we are indebted to you, as is all of Ogri'la and the Skyguard, for helping to protect our way of life here.$B$BAnd remember, $n, at any time you can gather apexis shards and return to any of those larger apexis monuments to make use of them.</RewardText>
