  <Title>A Dire Situation</Title>
  <Description>With their wolf pack reduced, the Horde is looking for replacements.  Unfortunately there's another source nearby.$B$BThe Bloodmaul ogres in the ravine below to the east keep a strong pack as their own sentries.  I hated sending you to kill the Thunderlord wolves, so why don't we do something different this time?$B$BI've derived a magic powder from the dust that naturally falls off the wings of our fey drakes.  Sprinkle it on the Bloodmaul dire wolves to make them undesirable to the Horde.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Apply Rina's Diminution Powder to 5 of the Bloodmaul Dire Wolves at Bloodmaul Outpost and in Bloodmaul Ravine.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Any luck out there?  I know that it's dangerous work to be doing this amongst the Bloodmaul ogres, but if we can avoid the killing of any more animals, I'll be happy.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I'm glad to hear that it worked.  The fewer the number of Nature's creatures that have to die, the better.$B$BWith all that you've done for us already, I must say that I'm beginning to grow very fond of your company.$B$BTake care, $n.</RewardText>
