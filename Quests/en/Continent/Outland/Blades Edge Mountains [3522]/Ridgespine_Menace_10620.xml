  <Title>Ridgespine Menace</Title>
  <Description>We hired on to help Toshley when he decided to move to Outland, and we've been on the move ever since.$B$BNow it looks like we've finally put down some roots.  All of the crazy scientists have their projects going, and us Roughriders are here to protect them.$B$BWhat we need right now is for you to go north into Razor Ridge, or east to the Scalewing Shelf, and keep them clear by killing the stalkers.  They're stealthy spiders that live amongst the rock outcroppings, and jump unsuspecting passersby.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 10 Ridgespine Stalkers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Those stalkers cleared out yet?   We've had a few of our people who headed north disappear.$B$BIf it's because of the stalkers, I want to make sure that it doesn't happen again.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Pretty good for a rookie.  As it turns out, we've got a small group of eggheads that want to go 'observe' the ethereals and their technology up north.  They'll be thrilled to know that you cleared the way for them.$B$BHere, take some of these.  We don't have many, but maybe they'll help you out in the future.</RewardText>
