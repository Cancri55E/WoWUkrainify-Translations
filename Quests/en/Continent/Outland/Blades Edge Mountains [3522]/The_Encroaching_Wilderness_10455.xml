  <Title>The Encroaching Wilderness</Title>
  <Description>We've been growing the Living Grove at an accelerated rate, but somehow the lynxes there have become lost to our control.$B$BWhere once their population was stable, the grovestalker lynxes are now beginning to encroach upon Sylvanaar, and there have been a number of unpleasant incidents of late.$B$BI suspect that the arakkoa of Veil Lashh are somehow behind it, but the immediate issue is with the lynxes themselves.$B$BI would be most grateful if you would help us to deal with this situation.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 12 Grovestalker Lynxes.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did I not speak the truth?  The grovestalker lynxes have become a menace not only to those who would travel the path here, but also to Sylvanaar itself.$B$BTheir deaths are regrettable, but the whole point of our creation of the Living Grove is so that Sylvanaar can be surrounded by a defensive region of natural beauty and tranquility.</CompletionText>
