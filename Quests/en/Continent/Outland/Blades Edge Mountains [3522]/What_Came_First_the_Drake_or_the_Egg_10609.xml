  <Title>What Came First, the Drake or the Egg?</Title>
  <Description>I'm researching the applications of drake essences to my work as a physician.  I think they could be a panacea for a host of maladies!$B$BI need someone to go south to the Singing Ridge and get me some.$B$BWilling to take my temporal phase modulator and use it on the nether whelps that hatch from the nether drake eggs?  Retrieve the essences from whatever they turn into.$B$BWhich, I might add, I'm not certain of what that will be as we're using some pretty dicey, time  and space modifying tech here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 3 Proto-Nether Drake Essences, 3 Adolescent Drake Essences and 3 Mature Drake Essences.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You have them?  You have the three drake essences that I so dearly need to continue my research?$B$BYou know that those nether drake eggs used to be black dragon eggs?  It's a fact!  But when Draenor blew apart, the resultant nether that raced across what was left mutated the eggs.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You've no idea how important this research could be.  Thank you!$B$BIt'll be interesting to delve into these essences.  I'm particularly curious to see if the nether effect that changed the black dragon eggs into nether dragon eggs resulted in any potential extra blessings for my studies.$B$BI'm thinking, in fact, that you should be the first person to test out the benefits of my little concoction.  Here, take these preliminary samples and use them when you find the need.</RewardText>
