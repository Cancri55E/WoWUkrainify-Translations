  <Title>Crush the Bloodmaul Camp</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Tor'chunk leans in close to whisper.&gt;$B$B$n, you've done us more than proud in the fight against the ogres so far.  And while I have every confidence in what Rexxar has planned, I would still ask that you crush the ogres at Bloodmaul Camp before returning.$B$BThat way we'll be doubly certain of the outcome.$B$BTo get there, head north down the ramp out of Thunderlord.  Then, at the base of the ramp, head west across Dragons' End and north through the Churning Gulch and Daggermaw Canyon.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 10 Bloodmaul Maulers and 5 Bloodmaul Warlocks.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you destroyed the Bloodmaul Camp yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Tor'chunk nods his head in obvious approval of your killing prowess.&gt;$B$BYou continue to impress me, $N. Every time one of those stinking ogres is felled, we come one step closer to ridding ourselves of an unworthy foe.</RewardText>
