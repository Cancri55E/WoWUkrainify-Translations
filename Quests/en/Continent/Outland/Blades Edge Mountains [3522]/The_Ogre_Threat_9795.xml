  <Title>The Ogre Threat</Title>
  <Description>As if the naga and their allies weren't enough, the ogres are extending their reach in the marsh. They've already conquered most of the area to the northwest and there isn't much of a buffer left.$B$BFor each one we kill, several more take their place. I'm not sure how long we'll be able to hold Zabra'jin once they decide to attack. Make your way north into the mountains, to the orcish stronghold of Thunderlord Stronghold and let Nekthar know of our plight. Any help he can spare would be most welcome.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel to Thunderlord Stronghold in the Blade's Edge Mountains and speak with Nekthar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Denjai seeks help? I'd send him reinforcements, but we're spread thin here as it is. We've got trouble of our own with the ogres up here.$B$BWhen I can, I'll give him what information we have on the local ogre tribes and their tactics. Perhaps if he can survive long enough, we'll be able to launch a two-pronged assault on the vile scum.</RewardText>
