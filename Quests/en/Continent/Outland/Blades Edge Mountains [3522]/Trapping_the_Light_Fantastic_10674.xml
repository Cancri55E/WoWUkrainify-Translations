  <Title>Trapping the Light Fantastic</Title>
  <Description>The Razaani ethereals have been playing with some interesting technology at Razaan's Landing to the north.$B$BI'm sure they won't mind if you use this trap to take a few samples of their little pink floating light orbs?  They're probably only for decoration anyway.$B$BThe trap has a special property to it that when opened should attract one of the floating balls towards it.  Of course, it'll probably also alert the Razaani to your presence.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Light Trap to collect 15 Razaani Light Orbs.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I take it that since we're speaking, you have the light orbs from the Razaan's Landing?  It'll be interesting to take a look at them and see what the ethereal are up to.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hey!  Wait just one damned minute!!$B$BThis doesn't look good...</RewardText>
