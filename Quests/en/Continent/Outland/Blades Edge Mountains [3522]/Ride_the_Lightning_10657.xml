  <Title>Ride the Lightning</Title>
  <Description>We haven't kept the use of the Zephyrium Capacitorium under budget.  But, it occurs to me that the serpents of the Scalewing Shelf to the east have a lightning breath and glands that we can make use of.$B$BI've repolarized the magneto collector to absorb lightning strikes and I want you to head up there, activate it on yourself, and get us some cheap fuel from those serpents.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Repolarized Magneto Sphere to absorb 25 lightning strikes from the Scalewing Serpents.  Also, collect 5 Scalewing Lightning Glands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The trick to using the repolarized magneto sphere is to know when to turn it off before you end up getting truly fried.$B$BOf course, you need to balance that against how many of those flying serpents you want to have to face.$B$BSpeaking of which, have you managed to charge up the sphere?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Woo hoo, it worked!  To be honest I wasn't sure... I calculated a twenty-three point seven two chance that you'd implode by the third strike.$B$B&lt;Toshley grins innocently.&gt;$B$BSo, now we know that the sphere works, we should have no problem meeting our energy needs for the Zephyrium Capacitorium.  Well, that is if we can find more volunteers to go out there and get zapped.$B$BStill, you've pioneered our efforts and deserve something in return!</RewardText>
