  <Title>Longtail is the Lynchpin</Title>
  <Description>With the Blackwing wyrmcultists massing in the tunnel, we're hard pressed to deal with the situation.  Quite frankly, they have the numbers.$B$BAnd while we've been able to take care of any of their people that get too close, the fact remains that if they attack in earnest, we're going to be overrun.$B$BThe situation calls for someone to get through to the other end of the tunnel, and take out their leader, Draaca Longtail.  Up for some fun?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Draaca Longtail, the leader of the wyrmcultists in the Wyrmskull Tunnel.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is she dead?$B$B$N, if we're to have a fighting chance here, we need you to sow confusion into their ranks by killing Draaca Longtail!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>With Draaca out of the picture, we should be able to take advantage of the situation.  They'll be in-fighting over who should be in charge, and that will relieve some of the pressure.$B$BThat is, unless the overseer mentioned in that note you gave me comes to take her place.$B$BLet's see if you can do something to make sure that never happens!</RewardText>
