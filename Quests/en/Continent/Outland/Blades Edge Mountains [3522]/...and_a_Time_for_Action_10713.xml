  <Title>...and a Time for Action</Title>
  <Description>We will not stand idly by while they decimate the Ruuan Weald around us.  Our first priority must be to the trees.$B$B$C, I want you to go back out into the Weald and deliver a very different message for us.  I want you to slay every one of their hewers that you come into contact with!$B$BIf they will not listen to reason, perhaps they will listen to a more assertive method of persuasion!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 10 Wyrmcult Hewers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you protected the trees? Are the hewers cut down?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $n.$B$BWhile we'll see to it that the wildlife will replenish itself in quick order, regrowing the trees, especially in a natural fashion, is a much more time-intensive process.</RewardText>
