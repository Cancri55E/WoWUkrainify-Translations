  <Title>Dust from the Drakes</Title>
  <Description>The Alliance has recently moved in to the west, using their elven magics to grow a town and grove in a short matter of time.  We must keep their defenses weak so that they do not also grow a spine.$B$BI have a plan that will do that and more.  I want you to traverse the bridge to the southwest, which crosses over Bloodmaul Ravine and leads into the Living Grove.$B$BAttack their fey drake defenses in the Living Grove and bring back the magical dust that sometimes can be found upon their wings.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 4 Dusts of the Fey Drake.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It would seem that the Alliance is determined to follow us wherever we go. Let us teach them that we are not intimidated by their presence.$B$BDo you have that which I have requested?</CompletionText>
