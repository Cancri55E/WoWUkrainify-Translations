  <Title>Gauging the Resonant Frequency</Title>
  <Description>Take these scanners to the Singing Ridge.  By dropping them in a pattern on the ground, you will create overlapping fields that will read the amplitude of the crystals.  Stand amidst them in such a way that you're in five oscillation fields and I'll have the information that I need!$B$BYour scanners will even work with those that others drop.$B$BOh, and it's likely that a rift will be formed!  I have no idea what, if anything, will come out of it, but be prepared for the worst.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Place the Oscillating Frequency Scanners in such a way that when you stand amongst them, you are hit by 5 overlapping Oscillation fields.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Well, do you have the measurements from the singing crystals that I asked for?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Oh, this is extraordinary!  I had no idea... it's almost as if those crystals are alive.$B$BI wonder if there's some sort of symbiotic relationship between them and the nether drakes?$B$BThank you, thank you!  You must accept a little something from my collection of odds and ends that I wouldn't be caught dead wearing.$B$BOne of them might look good on you, though.</RewardText>
