  <Title>Wrangle More Aether Rays!</Title>
  <Description>So, I hope that you're up to helping us wrangle up even more aether rays!  From what I can see, you're a natural with the rope!  And it's for a good cause, because not only do we get fresh mounts, but it helps us to protect Ogri'la, which the ogres appreciate.$B$BRemember, the aether rays fly around Vortex Summit, and the Crystal Spine to the northeast.$B$BThink you can wrangle me up some more?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Wrangling Rope to capture 5 Aether Rays.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You're doing great work for us, $n.  I want you to know that we really appreciate everything that you're doing to keep us stocked up in fresh mounts!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You continue to amaze me!  Tell you what... why don't you come back tomorrow and we'll let the rope cool off for now?$B$B&lt;Khatie laughs.&gt;$B$BThank you so much, $n!</RewardText>
