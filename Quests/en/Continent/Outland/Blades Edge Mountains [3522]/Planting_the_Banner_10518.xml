  <Title>Planting the Banner</Title>
  <Description>I want you to steal the Bladespire banner from one of their champions and take it south to Bloodmaul Outpost.  Plant it atop their Northmaul Tower.$B$BThis will infuriate the Bloodmaul and they will attack you relentlessly.  But it will also keep their hatred focused on Bladespire Hold, and away from Sylvanaar.$B$BYou will know you have accomplished the deed when you have defeated Gurn Grubnosh and taken his helm.  Return it to Sylvanaar.$B$B$n, this isn't going to be easy.  Take a  friend or two with you.</Description>
