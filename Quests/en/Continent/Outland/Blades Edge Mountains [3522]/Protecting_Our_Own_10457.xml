  <Title>Protecting Our Own</Title>
  <Description>Though you've done a great deal of good work in defense of our new home here, I still feel that the Living Grove needs more protection.$B$BPlease, take this small tree bough that I have imbued with the force of nature.  When used upon the seedlings that I have planted out in the grove, it will call down a storm to accelerate the growth of a treant defender.$B$BThese treants are critical to the defense of the grove, especially if you choose not to make Sylvanaar your home for long.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Rina's Bough on 5 of the Grove Seedlings to summon forth defenses for the Living Grove.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How fares the bolstering of the Living Grove's defenses?$B$BWith the intentions of the arakkoa at Veil Lashh unknown, and the Horde just on the other side of the ravine, I fear that if we do not move quickly we will find ourselves in a poor situation to protect our new home and our work in the grove.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Now that you have strengthened the grove's defenses, I feel much safer.$B$BYou've earned our thanks and appreciation, $n.$B$BOf course, it just occurred to me that there's something else that we need to take care of!</RewardText>
