  <Title>Whispers of the Raven God</Title>
  <Description>At Grishnath, totems left by the Oracles of the Raven enable the arakkoa to hear the Word of the Raven. Unfortunately, the language of the arakkoa is indecipherable to us.$b$bUsing the Harbinger's pendant, we can understand it. You will be able to take the souls of the arakkoa to understand their language. While you are suffused with the arakkoa's spirit, you can visit the totems and understand their message.$b$bDiscover this for us, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Grishna arakkoa to gain Understanding Ravenspeech for 2 minutes. While under the effects of the spell, you can find and receive the prophecy from the four shrines.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What is this $N? What do they believe he will do? Where do they believe he will lead them?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is truly disturbing. The arakkoa were peaceful for a long time. This cult of the Raven was nothing more than a gathering of misfits and madmen.$b$bBut their power has grown, that we cannot discount. Perhaps there is more to this Raven than we know.</RewardText>
