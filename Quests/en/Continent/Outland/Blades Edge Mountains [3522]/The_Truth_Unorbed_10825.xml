  <Title>The Truth Unorbed</Title>
  <Description>This strange, magical orb drops from beneath the contour feathers of the arakkoa.$B$BSuffused with an eerie, purple glow, the orb pulses to an unheard beat.  Holding it makes you mildly uncomfortable, and so you quickly place it within your pack.$B$BPerhaps Tree Warden Chawn at Ruuan Weald to the west, through the tunnel and across the Wyrmskull Bridge, would be interested in examining it?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver the Orb of the Grishna to Tree Warden Chawn at Evergrove in the Blade's Edge Mountains.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>$C, do you feel that?  I sense something unnatural and evil nearby.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Yes, it's that orb you have there!  Odd, it appears to be of arakkoan design.  Were you recently at Grishnath?$B$BAll right, that explains that, but I wonder what diabolical purpose this object serves.  Though it radiates evil, it also somehow feels as if it were connected to the natural world.$B$BHere, allow me to try to activate it.  The evil is so strong within it, there's some sort of residual memory here....</RewardText>
