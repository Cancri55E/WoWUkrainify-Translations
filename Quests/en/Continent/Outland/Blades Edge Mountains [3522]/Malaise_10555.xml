  <Title>Malaise</Title>
  <Description>The magic practiced by the Lashh'an arakkoa is unnatural. They rip out handfuls-clawfuls?-of their own feathers as reagents!$b$bThat doesn't sound like good magic to me. I've come here to learn more about their spells. Unfortunately getting close is too much for me.$b$bYou could succeed: cast one of their spells on yourself, then return to me. You'll have to find one of their spellbooks, high up in the trees of Veil Lashh.$b$bAnd unless you've grown feathers I can't see, you'll need to get some of those.
