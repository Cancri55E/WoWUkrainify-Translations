  <Title>The Bladespire Ogres</Title>
  <Description>To the north of the Bloodmaul clan lies a threat more grave:  Bladespire Hold.$B$BThe Bladespire ogres are the strongest clan in the mountains, having the favor of the gronn known as Gruul the Dragonkiller, and his seven sons.$B$BNow that we've dealt with winnowing the Bloodmaul, it is time to turn our eye upon their rivals.$B$BFrom Bloodmaul Hold head north through the ravine until you come to Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds.  Slay as many of the Bladespire ogres therein as you can.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay any 30 Bladespire Ogres in Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Bloodmaul or Bladespire, it doesn't matter.  All of the ogre clans fight against each other, vying for the dominance that comes with having the favor of Gruul the Dragonkiller.$B$BEach is still our enemy, regardless of who that favor has fallen to.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Your actions against both the Bloodmaul and the Bladespire ogre clans have gone a long way to securing Sylvanaar's future.  While we do not seek to expand past this patch of land, which we initially found empty, we will also not suffer those that would destroy us.$B$BAs you have done us good service, I would reward that service with the appreciation of the Alliance.</RewardText>
