  <Title>Grulloc Has Two Skulls</Title>
  <Description>To the east, at the terminus of Dragons' End, is the Cursed Hollow.  Therein, Grulloc, son of Gruul, plots his dimwitted schemes.$B$BI heard that one of his possessions was stolen from him through trickery.  Was that you?  Unfortunate that he was not slain in the process.$B$BIf we are to regain our freedom, I would have you take his most prized possession, a dragon skull from when he rejoiced in his father's slaying of the black dragonflight.  The only way you'll get the skull is to vanquish him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect Grulloc's Dragon Skull.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is Grulloc no more?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Indeed, it must have been a difficult struggle, $c.  I feel greatly relieved now that he will not be breathing down our necks here.$B$BI will send this skull down to Chort for safekeeping.  I'm beginning to think that with your help, we might just pull this off.</RewardText>
