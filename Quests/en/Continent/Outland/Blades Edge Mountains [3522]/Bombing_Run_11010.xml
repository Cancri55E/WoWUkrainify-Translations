  <Title>Bombing Run</Title>
  <Description>You have a flying mount... so what!  You think you have what it takes to use it properly?$B$BForge Camp: Wrath and Forge Camp: Terror, to the north and south, are a major pain in my backside, as well as being a threat to peaceful Ogri'la.  With all of those fel cannons shooting down the Skyguard left and right, we can't get through there to take care of business.$B$BYou want to prove yourself?  Take these bombs and knock out their ammo stacks.  Just don't let them shoot you down, too!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Skyguard Bombs to destroy 15 Fel Cannonball Stacks.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You take out their stacks of fel cannonballs yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, well, well, I guess you had it in you after all.  Good work.  Maybe Old Man Keller was wrong about you after all.$B$B&lt;Sky Sergeant Vanderlip smirks.&gt;</RewardText>
