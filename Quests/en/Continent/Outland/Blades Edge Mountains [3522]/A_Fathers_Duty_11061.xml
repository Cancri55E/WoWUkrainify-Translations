  <Title>A Father's Duty</Title>
  <Description>As to that other magical flask, it can only be obtained from one spot: Bash'ir Landing.  It's an ethereal base, and they aren't too friendly with outsiders, so it might be a little dangerous to obtain.$B$BWhere's Bash'ir Landing, you ask?  Well, if you get on your flying steed and head north by northeast, well past Forge Camp: Wrath, you'll eventually spot it.  The Bash'ir crystalforge itself is at the northeast corner of the landing.$B$BThank you for doing this, $n.  It'll mean the world to our sons!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect an Unstable Flask of the Sorcerer for him.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>That sorcerer's flask is sure to make my boys more intelligent than they already are, and that should help immensely with what they'll need to do once they're in the Sha'tari Skyguard.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We can't thank you enough, $n!$B$BNow with these two flasks, unstable though they may be, we'll be able to send one of our boys north to the Skyguard Outpost.$B$BHere, just wait a moment and we'll call for one of them.$B$B&lt;Torkus's right head shouts out for his boy in a low growl.&gt;</RewardText>
