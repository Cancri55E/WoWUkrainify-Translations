  <Title>Picking Up Some Power Converters</Title>
  <Description>Those dumb ogres at the Bladespire Outpost to the north have been raiding our power converters!  And you're going to get them back for me, sort of.$B$BNo doubt, with their big, clumsy hands, the ogres have damaged the converters.  So, what I want you to do is release the energy from them and then use this protovoltaic magneto collector on the resultant electromental to encase it.$B$BIt'll likely be sore with you, so you'll need to 'kill' it while it's contained in the magneto sphere.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Protovoltaic Magneto Collector to collect 5 Electromentals.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>This line of research we have going with the electromentals is exciting!  Just think of it... intelligent electrical creatures that we can create at will and that will follow our every instruction!$B$BWhat could possibly go wrong?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent!  With all of this power that you've recovered we'll be able to keep the machinery running for a little while, anyway.$B$BThe Zephyrium Capacitorium is a real pig when it comes to power consumption!$B$BI hope dealing with those electromentals wasn't too difficult.  I have something else in mind for you to do, and I have a feeling that it's going to be a little more dangerous.</RewardText>
