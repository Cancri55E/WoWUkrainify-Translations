  <Title>Trial and Error</Title>
  <Description>I've fashioned four wands that I believe will enhance the power of the arakkoa's crystals. Take these wands to Trogma's Claim, and try them on the ogre slaves.$b$bYou'll need to find an infused crystal off of the arakkoa in the area.$b$bWhen you figure out which is best, come back to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Try out each of Dertrok's wands on an Arakkoa Ogre Slave. Each wand will require an Infused Vekh'nir Crystal to use.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I eagerly await your results, $N.</CompletionText>
