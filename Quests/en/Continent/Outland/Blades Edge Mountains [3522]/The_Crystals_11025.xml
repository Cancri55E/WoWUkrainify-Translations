  <Title>The Crystals</Title>
  <Description>When prepared correctly, the crystals of the mountains exhibit strange powers, such as the clarity of mind that we have found here in Ogri'la.$B$BAll of the creatures atop the mountains covet the crystal shards and use them to further their own goals.  An economy has even sprung up around them.$B$BTo assist us, you must first learn about the Apexis shards.  Bring me some.  In addition to the creatures here having them, they can sometimes be found where the flayers dig at the larger crystals.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Chu'a'lor has tasked you with gathering 5 Apexis Shards.  Bring them to him at Ogri'la atop the Blade's Edge Mountains.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>As you come to understand the shards and crystals, you will be better able to assist us in protecting ourselves and our ogre brethren below.$B$BThe shards themselves get their name from an ancient and now-extinct arakkoan civilization, which used to live atop the mountains here.$B$BDo you have the shards with you?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Chu'a'lor's left head begins to speak.&gt;$B$BThese will do fine.$B$BRemember, $n, the value of the shard is not in what it can purchase for you.  It is not even in what it can potentially do for you when properly forged, though there is some debate over that.$B$B&lt;His right head finishes,...&gt;$B$BThe true value is in the journey to attain the shard.</RewardText>
