  <Title>The Bloodmaul Ogres</Title>
  <Description>There is a threat to Sylvanaar far deadlier than the Horde at Thunderlord Stronghold.$B$BI'm speaking of the native ogres of these mountains.  Just to the south and east, down in the ravine, lives the Bloodmaul clan.  While they aren't the only group of ogres that threaten us here, they are the closest.$B$BI would have you head south through the Living Grove, and then go down the path to the east, which leads to their outpost.  Slay as many of the Bloodmaul ogres at Bloodmaul Outpost as you can.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay any 30 Bloodmaul Ogres at Bloodmaul Outpost.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Our scouts have reported that the Bloodmaul ogres have begun to creep up the switchback, which leads up to the Living Grove from their hold.$B$BIt is unfortunate that we cannot find a way to live together in peace with the ogres, but then, when have we ever been able to do so?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is a good first step toward securing Sylvanaar and the grove.$B$BWith their ogres not so numerous, the Bloodmaul will think twice about attacking us here.$B$BNow, if only they were the only clan of ogres that we have to worry about.</RewardText>
