  <Title>An Apexis Relic</Title>
  <Description>Long ago a now-extinct sect of the arakkoa known as the Apexis lived here.  Remnants of their civilization are still present.  We call them apexis relics.$B$BWhat we know about them is that, when properly used, they grant a boon.  Each relic presents a colored sequence which, when the crystals are pressed in the correct order, leads through a series of levels, each harder than the last.$B$BAn apexis shard is needed to power the relic.  Return when you have attained the insight of the apexis vibration.</Description>
