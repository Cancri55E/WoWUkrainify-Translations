  <Title>The Bladespire Threat</Title>
  <Description>There is a threat to Thunderlord Stronghold worse than the Alliance at Sylvanaar.$B$BI speak of the ogres of these mountains.  Just to the west, down in the ravine, lies the Bladespire clan.  While they aren't the only ogres, they are the closest and they're the ones that we defeated to take this place.$B$BHead north through the Jagged Ridge, and then down the path, which leads to their hold.  Slay as many of the Bladespire ogres and their raptors as you can at Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay any 30 Bladespire Ogres and 10 Bladespire Raptors at Bladespire Hold and the Bladespire Grounds.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Our scouts have reported that the Bladespire ogres have established a camp even closer to the switchback, which leads from their hold up to us here.$B$BIt is unfortunate that we cannot simply subjugate these ogre scum to our will, but if it's a fight that they want, they will find the Horde more than accommodating.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is a good first step toward securing our position here against the ogres.$B$BWith their numbers decimated, the Bladespire will think twice about attempting to retake Thunderlord Stronghold.$B$BNow, if they were the only clan of ogres that we have to worry about.</RewardText>
