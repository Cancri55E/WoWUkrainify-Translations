  <Title>Rightful Repossession</Title>
  <Description>Our business relations with the blood elves appear to be at an end.  A few weeks ago a large shipment of surveying equipment was delivered to them at Manaforge Duro.  They have refused to pay for it.$B$B$n, I would ask that you pay the blood elves of Manaforge Duro to the east a visit.  They appear to be having some trouble with an infestation of mana creatures there, so take advantage of their preoccupation.$B$BI care not what happens to them, but I would very much like to see the return of our property.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Boxes of Surveying Equipment and return them to Gahruj at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have possession of the surveying equipment which the blood elves defaulted on?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, I for one am glad that this petty little business is behind us.  I cannot remember a time when the Consortium has had dealings with such boorish and untrustworthy beings.$B$BYou, however, seem to be very trustworthy, $n.  Perhaps you wouldn't mind doing me one more favor?</RewardText>
