  <Title>Bloodgem Crystals</Title>
  <Description>Kael's magisters have refined their usage of mana crystals to the point where they can siphon large amounts of energy in a matter of seconds.$B$BThey do this by attuning smaller bloodgem crystal shards to larger, fully charged ones.$B$BGo to Manaforge B'naar and obtain one of these shards from a Sunfury magister and use it to siphon energy from one of the larger crystals.$B$BReturn to me so that I may study the effects of the aura.  Do not worry; any side effects should be temporary.</Description>
