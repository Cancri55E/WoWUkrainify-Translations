  <Title>Consortium Crystal Collection</Title>
  <Description>Our leader, Nexus-Prince Haramad, has tasked me with the acquisition of a crystal artifact from the Arklon Ruins to the southeast.$B$BThey're old draenei ruins.  Unfortunately for both myself and the goblins here, the Burning Legion has decided to move in to perform their own excavation.$B$BIf you're willing to help me, go to the ruins and take the crystal artifact from the dreadlord named Pentatharon.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain an Arklon Crystal Artifact and return it to Nether-Stalker Khay'ji at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I get the impression that the prince is looking for a particular crystal, but I'm not certain what it is.$B$BHave you already recovered the one from the dreadlord?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Let me have a look at that.$B$BHmm, there doesn't appear to be anything special about it.  I doubt this is it, though the manner in which you describe the Burning Legion's activities at the ruins, it sounds as if they're searching for something in particular as well.$B$BLet us hope that it's not the crystal that the nexus-prince wants so badly.</RewardText>
