  <Title>Essence for the Engines</Title>
  <Description>As the X-52's chief of engineering, I have to see to it that the nether-rocket's main engines are in tip-top shape.$B$BUnfortunately, I haven't built them yet.$B$B$C, I'm in dire straits here!  I have almost all of the parts.  All that I'm missing is the engine core.$B$BLuckily for us, I think we can make use of the essence from the local mana wraiths to jump-start the engines.$B$BThey can be found near most of the glowing trenches in the northern part of the island.  Except for here in Area 52, of course.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 7 Mana Wraith Essences and return them to Chief Engineer Trep at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
