  <Title>Recharging the Batteries</Title>
  <Description>I have the very important task of collecting the machinery inside these ruins, but I'm having a problem keeping all of my bots charged up.$B$BThe phase hunters - those wyrm-looking things - have lots of energy!  You can find them all over the edges of this island, floating in from the nether.$B$BFill the battery on this recharging blaster by using it on a phase hunter when they're very weak, and then finish it off to soak up the last of its energy.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Battery Recharging Blaster on enough Phase Hunters to get the Battery Recharge Level to 10.  Then return it to Bot-Specialist Alley at the Ruins of Enkaat in the Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you recharged the battery in that blaster yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hey, watch where you're pointing that thing!  You've got it set to 'Kill'!!!$B$BIt looks like you've recharged the battery, and then some.  This'll help immensely to keep these guys going.</RewardText>
