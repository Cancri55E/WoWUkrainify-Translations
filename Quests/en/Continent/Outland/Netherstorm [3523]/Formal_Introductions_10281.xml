  <Title>Formal Introductions</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, $n. Do not be alarmed. This is merely a projection of my current form. It's the only way my companion and I could keep watch without revealing ourselves.$B$BThe ethereal who approached you, Marid, is little better than a swindler in the guise of a legitimate merchant. I'd like you to consider working with me instead. My purpose out here is to find out more about the unusual dragonkin on this ridge. Meet me at the north end of the ridge and we will discuss this further.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Tyri at the north end of the Celestial Ridge and speak with her.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>My name is Tyrygosa, of the brood of Malygos, but most call me 'Tyri.' My companion is the paladin Jorad Mace.$B$BWord of these strange dragonkin has already traveled far and I fear that too many will rush to exploit them for profit without realizing the true nature of what they're dealing with. With your help, we're hoping to gain insight into these creatures before others discover their presence.</RewardText>
