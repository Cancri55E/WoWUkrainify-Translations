  <Title>Capturing the Keystone</Title>
  <Description>It doesn't surprise me that Kael'thas has put the key to this ward in the hands of someone like Commander Sarannis. Prince Kael'thas is a great many things, but he is no simpleton.$B$BIn order to break this curse once and for all, you must enter Tempest Keep and claim the keystone.$B$BOnly once the keystone has been destroyed will I regain my freedom.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Venture into Tempest Keep's Botanica and retrieve the Keystone from Commander Sarannis. Bring it to Archmage Vargoth at the Violet Tower.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you obtain the keystone?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The archmage's eyes light up when you hand him the stone.&gt;$B$BAmazing! From what little I've seen of the fate of Farahlon, I'm not certain I want to go outside, but it's much better than being trapped here for the rest of my days.</RewardText>
