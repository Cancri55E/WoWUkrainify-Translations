  <Title>Off To Area 52</Title>
  <Description>I'm out here studying the nether - the ethereal currents and all that.  This is an ideal spot away from the lights and hubbub of town.  Isn't this bridge great?  If I could just keep this junk working.$B$BHey, you know, if you're looking for work there's plenty at Area 52!  It's just up the path and take a right at the fork in the road.$B$BWhy don't you deliver my latest research notes to Rocket-Chief Fuselage?  I'm sure that he'd have plenty for you to do, what with the X-52 rocket ship, and all!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver the Netherologist's Notes to Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Busy, busy.  No time to waste!  There's a rocket ship to be built!$B$BWhat do you want?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Oh, Coppernickels finally decided to report his findings, did he?  Lazy scientists!$B$BWhat's this?$B$B&lt;The chief riffles through the notations a few times, clearly with a look of disbelief.&gt;$B$BHe says here that the violent nether-energies flowing through the Netherstorm are going to rip everything to shreds in only a few months.$B$BThat's inconvenient - now we'll have to move up the time-table on building the rocket ship!</RewardText>
