  <Title>Manaforge B'naar</Title>
  <Description>You may have noticed one of Kael's manaforges on your way here.  You know, the large purple buildings sucking energy from the sky?$B$BWe were sent here by the Sha'tar to investigate them.  You can help our information gathering efforts by obtaining a personnel roster.  Giving us an idea of who's there and what they do will prove to be invaluable information.$B$BWe believe Captain Arathyn, leading a ballista team just outside of Manaforge B'naar, is in possession of one such roster.  Obtain it for us.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Spymaster Thalodien at Area 52 wants you to go to the outskirts of Manaforge B'naar and retrieve the B'naar Personnel Roster from Captain Arathyn.$B$BCompleting quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>Excellent!  With this roster we can make more educated decisions when targeting Kael's followers at the manaforges.$B$BIt's too bad, I was beginning to take a liking to killing his lackeys indiscriminately.</RewardText>
