  <Title>Shutting Down Manaforge B'naar</Title>
  <Description>I was having a friendly discussion with the Aldor while you were gone.  Manaforges sure look like modified naaru technology from Tempest Keep.  Apparently, most naaru constructs have certain safeguards that allow them to be permanently disabled in case of emergency.$B$BThe procedure is usually initiated at a control console via an access crystal.  Lo and behold, according to the roster you secured, such a crystal is in the possession of a fellow called Overseer Theredis.  Obtain it and see what you can do.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Manaforge B'naar and obtain the B'naar Access Crystal from Overseer Theredis.  Use it at the B'naar Control Console to shut it down, then report back to Spymaster Thalodien.$B$BPerforming quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did the plan work?  I was half-expecting you to get blown up, to tell you the truth.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Of course it worked!  I'm a spymaster; my information is always accurate.$B$BAnyhow, I have a whole new exciting job lined up for you.  You want to hear about it?  Of course you do.</RewardText>
