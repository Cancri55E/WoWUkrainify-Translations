  <Title>A Mission of Mercy</Title>
  <Description>We salvaged this prison orb on our last scouting mission into Ethereum territory. We'd have never found it had it not been for the distress signal that it was faintly emitting.$B$BWe think one of our own might be locked up in there but we have no way of opening the orb up without harming whatever is inside.$B$BWhat we know about the Ethereum is that any of their members could - at any given time - be carrying a key to unlock an orb. Retrieve one and return so that we may uncover the mysteries of this orb.</Description>
