  <Title>One Demon's Trash...</Title>
  <Description>You look like a capable young $g man: woman;!  I was wondering if you could lend me a hand?$B$BTo the east is the Scrap Field, which the Burning Legion has moved into.  It's full of huge fel reaver parts.  There're also a whole bunch of smaller parts in there that they don't seem to care about.$B$BI want you to get in there and get me a lot of those smaller fel reaver parts!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 10 Fel Reaver Parts and return them to Mama Wheeler at the Midrealm Post inside Eco-Dome Midrealm in the Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You have those parts yet?  With the Burning Legion moving in on each of our claims around here one at a time, we unfortunately have little time.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These will have to do for now, I suppose.  If only we could scare them off.$B$BHey, that gives me an idea!</RewardText>
