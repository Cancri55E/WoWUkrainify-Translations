  <Title>Retrieving the Goods</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Audi looks around and then lowers her voice.&gt;$B$BI'm sure Shauly told you a bit about our work here. When Jaxon and I are out in the field 'hunting,' we've been collecting pieces of the ethereal eco-dome generators and hiding them in the nests of our prey, the raptors in Eco-Dome Farfield.$B$BIt's a remote area to the northeast of the Stormspire, close to the Netherstone. I don't anticipate you'll run into many ethereals there, but would you be willing to help us collect the dome generator pieces?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Audi the Needle at the Stormspire wants you to bring her 10 Dome Generator Segments.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you collect everything?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent work! The most difficult part of the project is done. Now, all we need is a way to get these back to Area 52 and attract the interest of the Cenarion Expedition as well. There should be enough here for our own needs and to earn a little profit on the side.</RewardText>
