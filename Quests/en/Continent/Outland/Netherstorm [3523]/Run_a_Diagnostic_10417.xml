  <Title>Run a Diagnostic!</Title>
  <Description>Wherever the Consortium establishes a presence, we bring our eco-dome technology. The fields allow us to work in a controlled and life-sustaining atmosphere since we often find ourselves in hostile environments.$B$BNetherstorm's volatile conditions and creatures have begun to destroy the equipment that sustains our domes, especially the generator east of here. I've started a diagnostic there in hopes of understanding what can be done to combat the damage. Would you collect the results and bring them to me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve the Diagnostic Results and return them to Mehrdad at Midrealm Post.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get the diagnostic results?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Mehrdad nods, then examines the diagnostic results.&gt;$B$BThis is worrisome. The damage is much more severe than I believed. I can send to the Stormspire for some tools to begin repairs, but that's useless unless we've isolated what's damaging the equipment in the first place.</RewardText>
