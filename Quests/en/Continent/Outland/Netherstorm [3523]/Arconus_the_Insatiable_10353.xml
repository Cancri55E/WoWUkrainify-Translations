  <Title>Arconus the Insatiable</Title>
  <Description>Araxes and I were deployed to Ultris 2 days ago. Our mission: Find and terminate the void lord Arconus. We tracked him to this mine and discovered that he'd been feeding off the energies of the creatures in the area.$B$BA fire-fight broke out which resulted in Araxes and I separating. Now I'm stuck here, badly injured. The mission is in shambles!$B$BIf you can take out Arconus, high command would be grateful. Should you accept this mission, I will assist by providing a reflection of myself as a guardian.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Agent Ya-six at Access Shaft Zeon in Netherstorm has asked you to slay Arconus the Insatiable and return to Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
