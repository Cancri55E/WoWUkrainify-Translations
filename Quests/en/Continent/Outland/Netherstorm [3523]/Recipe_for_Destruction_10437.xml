  <Title>Recipe for Destruction</Title>
  <Description>Atop Manaforge Ultris lies the tear in the nether that the void lord, Dimensius, came through. That tear provides Dimensius with a link to the void, rendering him immune to physical harm. If we can get a lock on the conduit that Dimensius is using to keep himself phased out of this plane of existence, we can destroy it and then destroy Dimensius.$B$BTo do this, we're going to first need you to collect fragments of Dimensius from the void creatures that he sends out to do his dirty work.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Professor Dabiri at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm wants you to recover 8 Fragments of Dimensius.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you collected enough fragments?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent. With these fragments, we can calibrate a bomb that will destroy the void conduit atop Ultris. With the void conduit destroyed, Dimensius's connection with the void will be severed and he will be left defenseless!</RewardText>
