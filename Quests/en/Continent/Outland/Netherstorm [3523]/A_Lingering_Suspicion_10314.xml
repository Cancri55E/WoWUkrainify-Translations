  <Title>A Lingering Suspicion</Title>
  <Description>The strange magical device resembles nothing you've ever seen before. It's certainly not of blood elf manufacture.$B$BAs you sense spirits moving closer to the building, the orb glows with a greater intensity, which fades as the spirits leave. There's no question that it plays a role in the corruption of the ghosts.$B$BHow it works remains a mystery. Perhaps Custodian Dieworth will have some insight if you can provide the remains of some of the spirits along with your observations.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 Loathsome Remnants from the twisted spirits in Kirin'Var Village's Chapel Yard and bring them to Custodian Dieworth.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What have you discovered, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Custodian Dieworth examines the remnants.&gt;$B$BThe device you described sounds like a necromantic focus... I should've known that no-good apprentice would stoop to this. I thought his training would keep him from going this far, but I guess he's proven me wrong.</RewardText>
