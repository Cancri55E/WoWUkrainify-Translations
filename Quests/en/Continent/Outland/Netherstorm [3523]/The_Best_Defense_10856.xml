  <Title>The Best Defense</Title>
  <Description>Brave acts of industrial sabotage will only get us so far, $n.  Just as Forge Base: Oblivion serves as an assembly site for Fel Reavers, Forge Base: Gehenna serves as a staging ground for their army as it is where the majority of the Legion's teleportation devices are located.$B$BI want you to go in there and put a dent in their numbers.  They must have a full regiment of wrathbringers by now and we just can't allow that.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Nether-Stalker Nauthis wants you to slay 12 Wrathbringers at Forge Base: Gehenna, north of the Stormspire.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How goes it? Did you get a chance to show the Legion a lesson or two?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Nice work, $n.  Keep it up and I'll put in a good word with the Nexus-Prince.</RewardText>
