  <Title>Nexus-King Salhadaar</Title>
  <Description>I have in my possession another disruptor, one capable of destroying the three conduits that surround Salhadaar. Once the conduits are destroyed, Salhadaar's protective force fields will be down. For this act, he will strike at you with a ferocity you have never before witnessed, $n.$B$BIf you are willing to rid the world of Salhadaar, I will give you the disruptor.</Description>
  <LogDescription>The Image of Commander Ameer at the Ethereum Staging Grounds - Ethereum Transponder Zeta - wants you to use the Protectorate Disruptor to bring down Salhadaar's force fields and then destroy Nexus-King Salhadaar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is... Is he really dead? Destroyed?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It has been a thousand years, maybe more, since Salhadaar began his crusade to exterminate all that would stand in his way. I can hardly believe that this is the last we'll see of him... You have done all of us a great service, $n, and for that you will be rewarded.</RewardText>
