  <Title>Shutting Down Manaforge Duro</Title>
  <Description>So Manaforge Duro is under attack and Sunfury forces have lost control?  What a dilemma!  If Duro goes down, then Tempest Keep goes down.  Only drawback is... if Tempest Keep is destroyed, the explosion will probably take what little remains of this forsaken land with it.$B$BDead Kael'thas is good.  Dead everyone else is... not that great, I suppose.  It pains me to ask this of you, but go to Manaforge Duro and shut it down before it goes up in flames.  The access crystal is held by Overseer Athanel.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Manaforge Duro and obtain the Duro Access Crystal from Overseer Athanel.  Use it at the Duro Control Console to shut it down and report back to Spymaster Thalodien.$B$BPerforming quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you complete the shut down?  You should hurry before I change my mind about the whole deal.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That makes three manaforges you've shut down, $n.  Kael'thas must be having a real fit right about now.</RewardText>
