  <Title>Dealing with the Foreman</Title>
  <Description>The blood elves call the mine underneath Manaforge Ara the Trelleum Mine.  Ever since they lost the one underneath Manaforge Ultris, this is where their sole supply of material for running the forges is coming from.$B$BNeedless to say, it would be a boon for us to cripple their mining operation.  Perhaps we'd even be able to move in and take it over for ourselves?$B$BWhatever the case, I want you to go in there and deal with Foreman Sundown.  The mine is around the back of the island to the left.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deal with Foreman Sundown inside the Trelleum Mine, which is underneath Manaforge Ara in the Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
