  <Title>Fel Reavers, No Thanks!</Title>
  <Description>Ah, yes - the fel reaver!  Certainly the Legion's most terrible mechanical creation.  There are no less than three of these abominations aimed at the Stormspire.$B$BFortunately for us, they are not active yet.  This affords us the possibility of dealing with them through sabotage instead of brute force.$B$BObtain condensed nether gas from the gan'arg at Forge Base: Oblivion and fill a nearby fel reaver's fuel tank with it.  I've a feeling its engine won't handle it too well.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 5 Condensed Nether Gas from Gan'arg Mekgineers at Forge Base: Oblivion, northwest of the Stormspire, and load them into a nearby Inactive Fel Reaver.  Return to Nether-Stalker Nauthis after you've completed this task.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you try out my little experiment, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That is excellent news, $n.  Now that we know how to deal with these, I can have hirelings sabotage any remaining reavers.</RewardText>
