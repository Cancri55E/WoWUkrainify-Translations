  <Title>A Strange Vision</Title>
  <Description>I've had a most unusual vision, $n, and I don't know quite what to make of it. I've seen an arrow, an immense arrow, riding into the sky on a trail of fire. Such a feat is trivial for a skilled mage, but somehow I know the arrow I saw is not the product of magic.$B$BIt will be unlike anything the people of Azeroth have ever achieved. You must seek out the people working on this, $n. Lend them your help, for without it, their efforts may yet fail.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Rocket-Chief Fuselage at Area 52.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;The chief listens as you describe the seer's vision.&gt;$B$BWell, I don't know about any of that, but we could certainly use your help around here. Behold the rocket behind me! That's the X-52...$B$BIsn't it the most beautiful thing you've ever seen?</RewardText>
