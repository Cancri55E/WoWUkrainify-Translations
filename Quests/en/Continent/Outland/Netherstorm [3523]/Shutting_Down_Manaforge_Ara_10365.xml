  <Title>Shutting Down Manaforge Ara</Title>
  <Description>You've done much better than any of us anticipated.  Manaforge Ara is the last of Kael's working manaforges.  You'll find it northwest of here, though you're likely to have to do some circumnavigating to get to it.  We want you to shut it down.$B$BThe last access crystal is in the possession of Overseer Azarad.  This is Kael's very last source of energy as far as we know, so expect heavy opposition.  I'd bring a couple of friends along if I were you.$B$BHmm... Azarad.  What an odd name for a sin'dorei.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel to Manaforge Ara and obtain the Ara Access Crystal from Overseer Azarad.  Use it at the Manaforge Ara console to shut it down.$B$BPerforming quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you completed the task I asked of you, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The Burning Legion is in cahoots with Kael?  Hah!  Voren'thal is going to have a field day with this information.$B$BDo you think the thousands of pilgrims that have come from Azeroth want to be allied with the Burning Legion?  I think not!</RewardText>
