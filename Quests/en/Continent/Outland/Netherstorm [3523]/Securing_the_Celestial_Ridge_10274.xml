  <Title>Securing the Celestial Ridge</Title>
  <Description>The nether dragons have the same ferocious temperament as their black dragon forbears, but there is something entirely alien about them. They hatch and mature rapidly, harnessing the strange energies that forged their kind in the destruction of Draenor.$B$BThere is so much more I need to know about them, but I believe the powers may be of use to my own flight. If we can displace the leader of these drakes, Veraku, with a show of dominance, we can cow the rest of them into submission.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Challenge of the Blue Flight to provoke Veraku on the southern edge of the Celestial Ridge. Defeat him and return to Tyri and Jorad on the Celestial Ridge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you challenged and defeated Veraku?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n. Well done indeed. The nether dragonkin will not accept a blue dragon among them at first, but with time and the firm demonstration of my authority, they will come around. Scattered, isolated, and without a definitive leader, we must be vigilant in preventing them from falling under the sway of a malevolent power, keeping them in check all the while.</RewardText>
