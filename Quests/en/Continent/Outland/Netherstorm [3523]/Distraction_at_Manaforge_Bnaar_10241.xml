Unfortunately, the Scryers threaten to renege on their information-gathering duties unless we support them with military action.$B$BWe can't afford to compromise this mission over politics, so we've agreed to weaken the manaforge's defenses so that the Scryers can do their work.$B$BProve your loyalty to the Aldor and slay the Sunfury magisters and bloodwarders that guard Manaforge B'naar.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 8 Sunfury Magisters and 8 Sunfury Bloodwarders and return to Exarch Orelis at Area 52.$B$BCompleting quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation to decrease.</LogDescription>
