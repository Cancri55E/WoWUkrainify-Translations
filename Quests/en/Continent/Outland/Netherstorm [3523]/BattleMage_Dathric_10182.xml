  <Title>Battle-Mage Dathric</Title>
  <Description>The sword is of exceptional quality, finely crafted and perfectly balanced for a battle-mage. The seal of the Kirin Tor and the name "Dathric" are engraved into the weapon's pommel.$B$BTurning the weapon over in your hands, you notice a sense of wrongness radiating from the metal, as if the item is torn between two worlds. Could this be the item anchoring Battle-Mage Dathric's spirit to this world?$B$BPerhaps returning it to its proper place can break the bond, freeing Dathric's spirit to rest at last.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate Battle-Mage Dathric's quarters in Wizard's Row and return the blade to his weapon rack. Then, speak with Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What have you found, $N?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You've done well, $n. I can no longer sense any restlessness in Dathric's spirit. I would give much for the opportunity to speak to him one more time, but it is enough that he is finally at rest.</RewardText>
