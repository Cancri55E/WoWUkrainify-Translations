  <Title>Sunfury Briefings</Title>
  <Description>Something about these manaforges has been bothering me, $n.  Naaru technology is incredibly advanced; it should've taken Kael'thas years to even begin to understand it.$B$BInformation-gathering on the subject has been difficult as Kael's army is well disciplined and destroys all evidence of written communication.$B$BWe've been informed Manaforge Duro is under attack by mana creatures.  It is possible that those defending it have not yet destroyed their briefings.  Obtain them and bring them to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Go to Manaforge Duro and retrieve the Sunfury Military Briefing and the Sunfury Arcane Briefing from the Sunfury units stationed there.  Return to Exarch Orellis when you've completed this task.$B$BCompleting quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.</LogDescription>
