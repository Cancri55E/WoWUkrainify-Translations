  <Title>Shutting Down Manaforge B'naar</Title>
  <Description>We cannot shut down the manaforges by force as we'd risk causing an explosion that would shake Outland to the core.$B$BAccording to your transcription, there is an emergency shutdown that permanently disables the technology - a safety mechanism common in naaru constructs.$B$BTo perform this procedure you will have to obtain a crystal that will allow you to communicate with the console.  This access crystal is in the possession of an overseer called Theredis according to our information.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Manaforge B'naar and obtain the B'naar Access Crystal from Overseer Theredis.  Use it at the Manaforge B'naar console to shut it down and report back to Anchorite Karja.$B$BPerforming quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.</LogDescription>
