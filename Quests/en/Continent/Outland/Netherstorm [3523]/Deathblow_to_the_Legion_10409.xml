  <Title>Deathblow to the Legion</Title>
  <Description>When facing eredar of great power, large armies are useless for the most part.  Their corruptive powers over mortal souls are such that only the strongest-willed can even stand face to face with them.$B$BTake this stone to the Invasion Point: Overlord, between Forge Base: Oblivion and Gehenna and bring your closest, strongest friends with you.  Orelis and Karja will meet you at Socrethar's Seat; I will send Adyen along with them.$B$BMay the Light prevail today, $n.  May Socrethar meet his end.</Description>
  <LogDescription>High Priestess Ishanah wants you to go to the Legion Teleporter at the northwestern corner of Netherstorm and use it to teleport to Socrethar's Seat.  Once there, defeat Socrethar.$B$BPerforming quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation to decrease.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Report to Ishanah at the Aldor tier in Shattrath City.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <CompletionText>Light be with you, $C.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It is done, $N. Socrethar has been destroyed.$B$BI and the others will recover from our wounds, $N. The wrath of Socrethar's magic was far too much for young Kaylaan, however. Not even my strongest prayer could raise him.$B$BIt is an unbearable pity that one so young would fall in battle. However, in the end his will was strong enough to recover from the Legion's corruption and we may find solace in that.</RewardText>
