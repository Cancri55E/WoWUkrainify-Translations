  <Title>In A Scrap With The Legion</Title>
  <Description>The Burning Legion has moved in on our claim at the Scrap Field down the path and across the bridge to the east.$B$BThis could be a huge problem for us!  With the Legion at the Arklon Ruins, and now there, it's starting to look bad for us - and the rocket project - here at Area 52.$B$B$n, I need you to go out there and deal with those demons!  I'd do it, but I'm a lover, not a fighter.$B$BYep, this is going to be trouble, I can feel it!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 5 Mo'arg Doomsmiths and 15 Gan'arg Engineers.  Then return to Papa Wheeler at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I sure hope that you're up to that tussle with the Burning Legion.$B$BThere aren't many things that I hate worse than those that renege on a deal, or &lt;cough&gt; gnomes, but demons are certainly one of them!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, that's good and bad news, now isn't it?  We've dealt them a blow, but with the Burning Legion running free all over the Netherstorm - and getting closer to us here - well, I don't know how it's going to go.$B$BI have a feeling that we're going to have to change gears here for a while.  Hope you'll be able to help us out, $n.</RewardText>
