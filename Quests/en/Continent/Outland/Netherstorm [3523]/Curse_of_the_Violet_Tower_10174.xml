  <Title>Curse of the Violet Tower</Title>
  <Description>Now, you will be able to use the archmage's staff to contact him.$B$BHe resides in the Violet Tower, on an 'island' to the southeast. The tower is both sanctuary and prison to him, cursed as it is. Kirin Tor can neither enter nor leave, keeping me apart from my master.$B$BThe staff's magic can penetrate the tower's defenses, but only if invoked by one outside the Kirin Tor.$B$BTake the archmage's staff and use it to conjure his image. Tell him what has happened and that I have not completely failed him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Archmage Vargoth's Staff to make contact with Archmage Vargoth.$B$BIf you lose Archmage Vargoth's Staff, speak to Ravandwyr at Area 52 to receive a replacement.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Archmage Vargoth's image examines you as you convey Ravandwyr's message.&gt;$B$BRavandwyr has everything a master can expect of his apprentice. When I gave him the staff and told him to flee, I hoped that he would use it to find help and free me once Kael'thas's forces withdrew from the tower. Since then, I have learned a great deal about the nature of the curse.$B$BIt can be broken, $n, but it will require your help.</RewardText>
