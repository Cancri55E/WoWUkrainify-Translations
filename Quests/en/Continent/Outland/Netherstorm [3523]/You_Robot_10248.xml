  <Title>You, Robot</Title>
  <Description>Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T. at your service.  Here, take this controller.  I want you to activate it and give my newly-invented Scrap Reaver X6000 a spin.$B$BJust stay nearby!  The controller is tied to my console here, and if you get too far away, the robot will cease to function.$B$BTry out everything... I'll be watching and calibrating its servos based upon your test run.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Activate the Scrap Reaver X6000 Controller and test out its capabilities.  Then give your feedback to Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T at the Proving Grounds in the Netherstorm.  Deal with any problems that arise.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What did you think?  Still needs some tweaking, eh?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, my $g boy : girl; that certainly was exciting!  And for my money, I'd say that the Scrap Reaver X6000 performed admirably, despite its rookie pilot.$B$BHehe, no, don't take offense, I was just kidding.  After all, you just saved Area 52 and the X-52 Nether-Rocket from certain doom!</RewardText>
