  <Title>Destroy Naberius!</Title>
  <Description>Archmage Vargoth saw the danger in Naberius's pursuit of necromancy, but I don't think he ever anticipated that his own apprentice would wreak this much destruction upon the Kirin Tor.$B$BYou must defeat him, $n, or else he will continue enslaving the spirits of our fallen brothers, robbing them of their rightful rest and destroying what little remains of Kirin'Var.$B$BWith his phylactery in hand, he can be confronted by two or three combatants, but who knows what his magic might do to more foes?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Custodian Dieworth in Kirin'Var Village wants you to confront and defeat Naberius in the village's Chapel Yard.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you destroyed the lich of that wretched Naberius?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The defeat of Naberius is a great achievement, $n. I can't help thinking that we might have had a chance against Kael'thas's forces if the apprentice's loyalties had been in the right place that day.</RewardText>
