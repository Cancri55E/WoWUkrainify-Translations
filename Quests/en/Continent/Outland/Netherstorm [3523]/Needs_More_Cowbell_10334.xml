  <Title>Needs More Cowbell</Title>
  <Description>Where, oh where has my Bessy gone? After the attack, I searched the fields and the Chapel Yard for her, but she was nowhere to be seen!$B$BAll I have left of her is this old cowbell. She usually comes running when she hears it, but these feeble old bones probably couldn't shake it hard enough.$B$BI'll loan you Bessy's bell if you're willing to go out to the fields and ring it as hard as you can. Perhaps all Bessy's waiting for is a little more cowbell.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Bessy in the fields near Kirin'Var Village's Chapel Hill in Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;The cow looks at you distrustfully, but stands its ground.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Removing the bell from your pack, you ring it a couple of times and show it to Bessy, who seems to recognize it. The cow allows the bell's cord to be fastened around her neck and looks at you expectantly.&gt;</RewardText>
