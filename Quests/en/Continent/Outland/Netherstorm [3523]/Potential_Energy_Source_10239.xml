  <Title>Potential Energy Source</Title>
  <Description>We are not the only ones battling the influx of the mana beings. The blood elves, too, are troubled by them, but I'm not sure why.$B$BWhatever they're involved in over there, they don't seem to be stopping. Instead, I've seen them employ a variety of methods to kill the creatures. The most effective involves magical defenses fueled by some sort of concentrated energy.$B$BCapture some of these energy sources and bring them to me. Don't hesitate to stymie the elves if an opportunity presents itself.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran at Kirin'Var Village wants you to capture 10 Energy Isolation Cubes from the blood elf operations at Manaforge Coruu.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to gather any of their energy sources?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Morran gingerly handles one of the containers.&gt;$B$BI don't believe I've seen anything like this before. There's certainly a lot of energy suspended in here, but it's in a raw form. We'll have to be careful with it, but I think we can find a way to adapt this to help ward off the mana creatures.</RewardText>
