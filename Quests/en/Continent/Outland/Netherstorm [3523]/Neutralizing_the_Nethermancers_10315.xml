  <Title>Neutralizing the Nethermancers</Title>
  <Description>The blood elves are fools!  I'm glad that our trade relations with them have fallen apart.  In all of my travels throughout the cosmos, I have never encountered beings so selfish.$B$BThey continue to destroy the land around us with their manaforges, so let's see if we can put a dent in their operations across the bridge at Manaforge Ara.$B$BTheir nethermancers channel energy to and from the blood gems to stabilize the flow of power.  Go over there and wipe them out!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 15 Sunfury Nethermancers and return to Nether-Stalker Oazul at Tuluman's Landing in the Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How many nethermancers have you managed to fell?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Anything that we can do to encourage them to stop what they're doing at these manaforges is a good thing.$B$BThey certainly do not seem to be able to be reasoned with.  And it seems clear to me that whatever their leaders have in mind, they are insane.$B$BAs remuneration for your faithful service to the goals of the Consortium, I would like to offer you the coin of your realm if it does not offend you.</RewardText>
