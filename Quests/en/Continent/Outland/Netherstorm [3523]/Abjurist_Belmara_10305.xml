  <Title>Abjurist Belmara</Title>
  <Description>This worn, sturdy tome is no spellbook, as you might expect a Kirin Tor mage to carry. The pages of the volume are covered with hand-copied stories, accompanied by colorful illustrations.$B$BThe tome seems to be far older than its former owner and may have even been a family heirloom. A powerful tie to the book may have been the last thread tying Belmara's spirit to the ruins of Kirin'Var. Returning it to its proper place on the bookshelf in her quarters might help appease her restless spirit.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate Abjurist Belmara's quarters in Wizard Row and return the book to its Bookshelf. Then, speak with Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What have you found, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah, yes. I'd heard that Abjurist Belmara had an old book of stories, but I had no idea that she brought it with her to Outland. I'm certain her spirit will rest easier knowing that you've found it and returned it to her dwelling.</RewardText>
