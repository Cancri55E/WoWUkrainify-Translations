  <Title>Electro-Shock Goodness!</Title>
  <Description>Around the ruined manaforge you will find the run-off of Dimensius's handy work. Seeping sludge occupies the pools that surround Ultris. Directly below those pools, where the Ethereum Staging Grounds now stand, you will find even more run-off in the form of void waste.$B$BThe best method of disposal is to use electro-shock to break slimes down to globules. Use this elixir to augment your attacks with electricity. The resultant discharge will break the slimes up into their raw form. Destroy the globules!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Researcher Navuud at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm has asked that you destroy 30 Void Waste Globules and 30 Seeping Sludge Globules.
</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Both the sludge and waste are extremely toxic. They will form into a congealed void horror if left unchecked!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I hope it's not too late. Did you notice any abnormally large slimes at or near the area where the void wastes drain into?</RewardText>
