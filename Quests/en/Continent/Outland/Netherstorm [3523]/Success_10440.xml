  <Title>Success!</Title>
  <Description>The test was a resounding success! We can certainly use this device to start repairing the domes.$B$BCarry word of the test results to the Stormspire and let Ghabar know that I've also found a pattern in the damage to the shield generators. Key pieces of generator units have gone missing from a number of sites. This is no accident, $n, no technological failure. We're being stolen from. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Ghabar at the Stormspire in Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'll have my techs get to work on those repairs right away.$B$BTashar's suspicion of sabotage worries me, though. I can't think of anyone who would be bold enough to steal our technology. Not anyone who knows what we're capable of, anyway. It may be time to lock down the Stormspire.</RewardText>
