  <Title>The Unending Invasion</Title>
  <Description>Kael'thas's assault on Kirin'Var began with thundering noise and a bright flash of light in the officer quarters to the northwest. The destruction there was the most severe and after the withdrawal of the blood elves, a strange thing began to happen.$B$BBeings of pure mana began streaming into the village from all over the area. For now, we're containing them as we can, but with more information about the weapon Kael'thas used, I hope to cut off the flow of mana creatures entirely.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search the mana creature infested area of Kirin'Var Village for a Mana Bomb Fragment and bring it to Lieutenant-Sorcerer Morran.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find the remains of the weapon Kael'thas used against the village?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>A mana bomb?$B$B&lt;Morran turns the fragment over in his hands.&gt;$B$BIt's nigh unthinkable! Even the best minds in Dalaran couldn't have conceived of a weapon like this. The sheer magnitude of the disturbance must've torn a rift in the nether, giving these creatures access to our lands.</RewardText>
