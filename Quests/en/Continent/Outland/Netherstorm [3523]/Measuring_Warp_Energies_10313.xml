  <Title>Measuring Warp Energies</Title>
  <Description>If our instincts are right and these manaforges have been made using technology from Tempest Keep, then all of Outland could be in grave danger.$B$BTempest Keep's energy-recharging mechanisms were never supposed to be used this close to the land.  The warp energies are capable of destroying this very land, even when contained within Kael's pipelines.$B$BTake this orb to Manaforge B'naar; it is attuned to measure warp energies.  Use it at the pipelines' ends, where they go into the earth.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Exarch Orelis in Area 52 wants you to take the Warp-Attuned Orb to Manaforge B'naar and use it at the end of its four pipelines.$B$BPerforming quests for the Aldor will cause your Scryers reputation level to decrease.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you performed the measurements I asked for, $N?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is grave news, $N.  The warp energies emanating from the pipelines are dangerously high.$B$BWe must find a way to shut down the manaforges or what little remains of Outland will be shattered into pieces.</RewardText>
