  <Title>Creatures of the Eco-Domes</Title>
  <Description>Your work with the lashers turned up some astounding information, but I wonder if it holds true for animals as well.$B$BGathering information on the talbuks that live underneath this dome is going to be trickier than studying the lashers, I'm afraid.$B$BUsing this tagging device, you can put a weakened talbuk to sleep and apply a tag that I'll use to track the animal as it matures. The tagging mechanism won't work unless the talbuk has expended most of its energy.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Tag 12 Talbuks for Aurine Moonblaze at the Stormspire. You may tag either Talbuk Sires or Talbuk Does using the Talbuk Tagger.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to tag enough of the talbuk?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent work. I'll keep a close eye on the ones you tagged and see if they mature as quickly as the other lifeforms in the dome.$B$BWith the proper control, we could use this technology to regrow the ruined areas of Outland and Azeroth.</RewardText>
