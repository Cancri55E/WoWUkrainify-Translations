  <Title>Diagnosis: Critical</Title>
  <Description>If Mehrdad's results are correct -- and I have no reason to believe they're faulty -- then the rest of the domes could be in trouble.$B$BI do think Mehrdad has failed to identify the underlying cause of the failures. From time to time, creatures damage the generators, but never this severely.$B$BTo be on the safe side, I'd like for you to run a set of diagnostics at the Stormspire's main dome generator, located in Eco-Dome Sutheron at the very eastern edge of the dome.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Diagnostic Device while standing near the Eco-Dome Sutheron Generator and bring the Diagnostic Results back to Ghabar at the Stormspire.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get those diagnostics?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These results match Mehrdad's exactly, but why? The only possible explanation I can think of is that some of the dome generation equipment has failed or gone missing. That would cause the domes to weaken significantly and fall out of balance as the diagnostics indicate.</RewardText>
