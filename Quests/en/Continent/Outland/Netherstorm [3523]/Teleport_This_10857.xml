  <Title>Teleport This!</Title>
  <Description>As fun as killing demons might be, it does us little good when the Legion can keep using its teleporters to replace anything we kill.$B$BUnfortunately, I don't have any high-powered explosives handy... but the mo'arg that maintain the teleporters do.$B$BTake this rod... I've tuned its powers to interfere with mo'arg brain frequencies.  Return to Forge Base: Gehenna and use it on any mo'arg you see.  You won't have long, but you'll be able to use their demolition charges on the nearby teleporters.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Nether-Stalker Nauthis wants you to use the Mental Interference Rod on the Mo'arg at Forge Base: Gehenna and use their Detonate Teleporter ability on the three teleporters in the forge camp.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is it done then?  Are the teleporters shut down?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thanks to you, $n, I'll breathe a little easier.  Figure of speech, of course!$B$BI suppose you'll want some form of reward now.</RewardText>
