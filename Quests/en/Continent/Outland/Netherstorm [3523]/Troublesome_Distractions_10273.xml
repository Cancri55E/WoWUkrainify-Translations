  <Title>Troublesome Distractions</Title>
  <Description>Your former employer, Wind Trader Marid, must've gotten wind that you're helping us now. Through my projection, I've seen his nether-stalkers entering the area, hoping to track us down.$B$BWe've been able to evade them so far, but Marid must be dealt with before the problem grows more severe.$B$BIf your impressions of Marid are correct, he'll do just about anything to secure the supply of his product. Return to him and tell him you're prepared to offer a deal. Lure him away and slay him.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Wind Trader Marid and lure him away from his trading post. Deal with him and then return to Tyri and Jorad on the Celestial Ridge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>This Marid is a fool, or shall I say, was a fool.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Now that that troublesome ethereal has been dealt with, we can focus our efforts on understanding these nether dragons. I've had a chance to examine the eggs and I've made a few discoveries.</RewardText>
