  <Title>Cohlien Frostweaver</Title>
  <Description>Looking at the hat, you find yourself asking if any Kirin Tor mage would own such headgear. Judging from the hat's wear, it seems the gnome wouldn't go anywhere without it.$B$BYou try on the hat momentarily, discovering no magical properties beyond a faint urge to dance.$B$BThe treasured possession might be the source of the dead mage's bond to the village. Placing the hat in the footlocker in Cohlien's quarters might free his spirit.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate Cohlien Frostweaver's quarters in Wizard Row and return the hat to his Footlocker. Then, speak with Custodian Dieworth at Kirin'Var Village.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What have you found, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The custodian smiles at the mention of Cohlien's name.&gt;$B$BYou're absolutely right about the hat. He wore it all the time and wouldn't let it out of his sight.$B$BThere were a couple of times when a fellow mage, who shall remain nameless, 'borrowed' the hat and hid it as a prank. Needless to say the threat of one of Cohlien's frostbolts changed his mind.$B$BI'm going to miss little Cohlien. He had quite a way with the elven women.</RewardText>
