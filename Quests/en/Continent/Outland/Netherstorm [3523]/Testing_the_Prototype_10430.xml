  <Title>Testing the Prototype</Title>
  <Description>I've been working on a portable generator repair kit for use in some of the harsher climates that the Consortium operates in. Granted, it wasn't designed for Netherstorm, but we shouldn't have any problems with it.$B$BI had already scheduled a test with one of my best techs up at Eco-Dome Farfield beyond the Netherstone to the northeast. Take this prototype to Tashar. He'll know what to do with it. If it works, we can use it to reinforce the shield generators at the larger domes.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Repair Apparatus to Tashar at Eco-Dome Farfield in Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It looks like you've got the prototype. Did Ghabar send you?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This looks a little peculiar. Ghabar definitely didn't have Netherstorm in mind when he designed it.$B$BDon't look so surprised, $n. Netherstorm is tame compared to some of the environments I've worked in. Nevertheless, a failing dome is always a concern.</RewardText>
