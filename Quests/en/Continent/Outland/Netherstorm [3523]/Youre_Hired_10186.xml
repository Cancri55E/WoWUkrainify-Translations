  <Description>Let me be the first to welcome you aboard, Junior Technician 3rd Grade $n!$B$BWe're building my masterpiece out here - the X-52 Nether-Rocket!$B$BBut first we need to get all of the parts and fuel for it.  That's where you come in.$B$BTo start, I need crystals - LOTS of crystals - for the rocket's Etherlithium Engine Matrix.  The draenei had crystals coming out of their ears!$B$BSo head north to the Ruins of Enkaat and get them for me!  Nevermind all of the draenei ghosts.</Description>

  <CompletionText>Does it look like the X-52 Nether-Rocket is ready for liftoff?  Am I cruising the Twisting Nether in the comfort of my command chair?  Exploiting strange new worlds?  Seeking out new technology and business opportunities?  Boldly going where no goblin has gone before?$B$BNo!$B$BSo, I hope you have those crystals that I sent you after.</CompletionText>
