  <Title>Pick Your Part</Title>
  <Description>Those ethereal clowns are as opportunistic as us, I'll give them that.  But no one, and I mean NO ONE, moves in on a B.O.O.M. claim!$B$BThe Heap to the south is ours!$B$BIf we're to finish the X-52 Nether-Rocket, we're going to need all of the new tech that we can get our hands on.  And since the ethereals are stealing from us, I think it's only fair that we repay them in kind.$B$BWhy don't you head down there and see if you can acquire some of their technology out from under their noses!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 pieces of Ethereal Technology and return them to Papa Wheeler at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Back with their tech so soon?  You better not just be pulling my leg here, $c.$B$BThe success of the X-52 project out here depends upon you getting us that stuff a.s.a.p.!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hehe, ethereal suckers!$B$BThanks for getting us these parts, $c.  I bet we can just hook these babies right up inside the rocket.  I wonder what they do?  Should be fun finding out!$B$BHmm, let me see if I can dig up some pocket change to throw your way.</RewardText>
