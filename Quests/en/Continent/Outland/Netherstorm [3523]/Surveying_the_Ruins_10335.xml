  <Title>Surveying the Ruins</Title>
  <Description>I have to get over to the Ruins of Farahlon to start my excavations!  The problem is that the place has been infested by demons!$B$BMaybe you could do some preliminary work for me?$B$BThere are three locations within the ruins to the northeast where I want you to place surveying markers.  Each is near a draenei banner.$B$BReturn to me when you've managed to place all three markers.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place the three Surveying Markers and then return to Zephyrion at the Stormspire in the Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>That was fast.  You must be a very efficient person to have placed all three of those markers already.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You're not just pulling my bandage, right?  That's most excellent news!$B$BNow that you've done the surveying grunt-work, I'll be able to take my team up to the ruins and see what's there to be procured.$B$BYou have my thanks, $c.</RewardText>
