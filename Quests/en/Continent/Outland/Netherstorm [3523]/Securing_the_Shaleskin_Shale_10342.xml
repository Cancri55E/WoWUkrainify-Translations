  <Title>Securing the Shaleskin Shale</Title>
  <Description>I make a good living selling drinks to the boozehounds around here.  But I want something more!$B$BThe rocket-chief is always telling me how he can't perfect the rocket fuel needed to get the X-52 off of the ground.$B$BWe can solve that little problem for him.$B$BFor starters I need to extract the oil from the shale of the local shaleskin flayers!  It'll form a concentrated, if explosive, base for the mix that I have in mind.$B$BFind the flayers, and their shale, all over the place near the purple rocks.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 5 Shaleskin Shale and give them to Boots at Area 52 in the Netherstorm.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You have enough of that shale yet?  I'm going to need a lot of it to extract the amount of oil that'll be needed for the X-52 Nether Rocket's fuel.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>OK!  Ingredient number one is down.$B$BNow, if you're up to it, we'll move on to something that'll give the shale oil that little extra kick that it'll need to blast the nether rocket into the Twisting Nether... or oblivion, whichever comes first.</RewardText>
