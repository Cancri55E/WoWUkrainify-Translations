  <Title>Shutting Down Manaforge Coruu</Title>
  <Description>Thalodien told us of your success in disabling Manaforge B'naar.  He expects a repeat performance here and asked us to keep an eye out for anyone using a crystal to access the console inside.  Overseer Seylanna holds the access crystal, we're sure of it.$B$BGo back in there and finish the operation.  No need to be stealthy anymore; get the crystal, begin the shutdown, kill the technicians trying to stop you and get out.$B$BHurry, it won't be long before Kael's lapdogs sniff us out.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Coruu Access Crystal from Overseer Seylanna.  Use it at the Coruu Control Console to shut down the manaforge and return to Caledis Brightdawn.$B$BPerforming quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation level to decrease.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you completed your task yet, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We heard all the commotion and were just about to leave.  Glad to see you didn't take too bad of a beating.</RewardText>
