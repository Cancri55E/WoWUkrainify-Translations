  <Title>When Nature Goes Too Far</Title>
  <Description>The dome technology possesses such power! Certainly, there are bounds beyond which we dare not go, $n.$B$BCreatures allowed to grow too large or too fast could be just as bad as a barren landscape.$B$BI have heard rumors of just such a creature in the pool to the east. I've heard the ethereal merchants conspiring to catch the overgrown hydra for sport, but I have another purpose in mind for the giant. Bring me the creature's heart so I may study it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Aurine Moonblaze at the Stormspire wants you to bring her a Hulking Hydra Heart.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get the sample from the monstrous hydra?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Aurine accepts the heart.&gt;$B$BEven for a creature of that size, this heart is far too large. It struggled to keep up with the creature's gigantic body. I have little doubt it would've died before reaching half its normal lifespan.$B$BEven with such risks, I'm determined to convince the Consortium to share their technology. There's too much promise here to give up now.</RewardText>
