  <Description>You haven't seen a heavy smithing hammer lying around by chance, have you? I brought it out here with me to finish the shoes for some of old man Amorlin's horses, but I can't find it.$B$BI've searched the barn no less than a half dozen times and I just can't seem to find it. Maybe one of the other apprentices retrieved it and took it back to the smithy? Would you be willing to go down there and take a look? The workshop is to the southeast of the tower in the Town Square.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve the Smithing Hammer from the Kirin'Var Apprentices and bring it back to Apprentice Andrethan in Kirin'Var Village.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you have any luck finding my hammer?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank goodness! Now I can get back to work. I know you think I'm crazy, working on the piece that will earn me journeyman status away from the forge proper, but I can't run the risk of one of the other apprentices copying my design.</RewardText>
