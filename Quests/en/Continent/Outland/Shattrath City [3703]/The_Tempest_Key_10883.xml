Those that prove their strength will be granted favor by the naaru.$B$B&lt;Khadgar nods.&gt;$B$BA'dal awaits...

  <RewardText>Tempest Keep is a naaru creation, mortal. Access to the vessel has always been within our power to grant. A return to Tempest Keep, though, had been deemed unnecessary. A point of pride for a mortal race, perhaps, but naaru invest little in such things.$B$BWe go now because we must. Kael'thas cannot be allowed to utter the words of damnation.$B$BWhile the way is open, only a fool would enter unproven. Do not underestimate the purpose of the trials, mortal.</RewardText>
