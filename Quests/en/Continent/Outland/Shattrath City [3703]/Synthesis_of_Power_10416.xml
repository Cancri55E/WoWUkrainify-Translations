  <Title>Synthesis of Power</Title>
  <Description>Arcane tomes are not ordinary books that happen to deal with arcane matters.  There is intrinsic power in them - a power I've learned to synthesize into a single arcane rune.$B$BShould you find an arcane tome in your travels I will give you one such rune.  Only the most powerful wielders of magic carry the books I need.  In Outland this usually means Kael's blood elves - but you'd be surprised by where such tomes often turn up.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Voren'thal the Seer in Shattrath City wants you to obtain an Arcane Tome.$B$BPerforming quests for the Scryers will cause your Aldor reputation to decrease.</LogDescription>
