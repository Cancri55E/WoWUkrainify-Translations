  <Description>I don't think that I'm up to the hunt today.  Do you think that you might take my place?$B$BI told Hemet that I was going to see about bagging us some of those talbuk that seem to be all over the place.  The stags are especially nice to hunt.  You can find them congregated around the nearby trees.$B$BThink that you could take care of that for me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 12 Talbuk Stags and then return to Harold Lane at the Nesingwary Safari in Nagrand.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I'm just going to lay here a little while longer.  I should be fine soon.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That's a good tale... &lt;cough&gt;...of how you bagged all of those stags, $c.  But I think that you can do better.  I've got something else in mind for you.</RewardText>
