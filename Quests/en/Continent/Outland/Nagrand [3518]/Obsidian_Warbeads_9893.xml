  <Title>Obsidian Warbeads</Title>
  <Description>All this waiting around for Oshu'gun to be ready for digging is eating into our profits, $n.$B$BFortunately, I've devised an alternate source of income.  The ogres of Nagrand wear warbeads made of obsidian, a mineral that commands a hefty price in many other worlds.$B$BZerid already has had to take care a few of the brutes as a matter of security.  Think of the warbeads as an added bonus.  Or better yet, don't think about it too much and just bring them to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 10 Obsidian Warbeads to Gezhe at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How are those ogres treating you, $N? Tough bunch, aren't they?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent. This will keep us in business while we wait for the Sha'tar to finish whatever housekeeping it is they need to do inside Oshu'gun. </RewardText>
