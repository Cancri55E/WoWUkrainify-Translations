  <Title>What the Soul Sees</Title>
  <Description>For several centuries, the spirits of Auchindoun coalesced into my darkened essence. Many of the catastrophes that befell this crypt were a direct result of my weakened state.$B$BRegrettably, there is nothing that can be done to stop this cycle. It is a facet of the naaru condition - without the void, the Light cannot exist.$B$BYour only recourse is to destroy the ancient spirits of Nagrand before they transform into creatures of the void. Use the soul mirrors found throughout this crypt to free them...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate a Soul Mirror somewhere in the Auchenai Crypts and use it to call forth a Darkened Spirit from Ancient Orc Ancestors in Nagrand. Destroy 15 Darkened Spirits so that the ancestors may rest in peace.$B$BReturn to Mother Kashur at the Ancestral Grounds when this task is complete.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;Mother Kashur is visibly upset.&gt;These naaru are wise beyond all manner of life on this world. </CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You have completed a long and dangerous journey, risking life and limb to ensure the safety of the Mag'har and the serenity of our ancestors. For this I am thankful beyond what words could convey. </RewardText>
