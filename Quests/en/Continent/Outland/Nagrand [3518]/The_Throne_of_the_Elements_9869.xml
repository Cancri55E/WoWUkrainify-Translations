  <Title>The Throne of the Elements</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, $r. I am Ioki, elementalist of the Earthen Ring. I have come to Telaar to inform the Kurenai of the state of the elements.$B$BCould I ask a favor of you? Would you travel to the Throne of the Elements in the northern hills of Nagrand, beyond Skysong Lake, and tell elementalist Sharvak that I have arrived at Telaar safely? She will surely reward you for this small deed.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Elementalist Ioki wants you to travel to the Throne of the Elements and speak with Elementalist Sharvak.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ah, thank you for the message. Perhaps you would not mind helping out the Earthen Ring? The elements are in flux. We can use all of the assistance that we can get.</RewardText>
