  <Title>Against the Illidari</Title>
  <Description>I still have respect for Illidan.  Without him I would not have found my path.$B$BHe is not who he once was, however.  His soul has been corrupted by power, his mind has been twisted by defeat.  He has become what I am sworn to destroy and his pet servants, the Illidari, are as much of an abomination as any demon of the Burning Legion.$B$BHis grasp on Outland is slipping yet his reach is still vast.  Prove you're not with him by slaying his lieutenant Lothros at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley.</Description>
