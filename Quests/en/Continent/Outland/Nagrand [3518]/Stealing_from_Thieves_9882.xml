  <Title>Stealing from Thieves</Title>
  <Description>Nexus Prince Haramad has ordered us to not begin work inside of Oshu'gun as it might anger a certain powerful naaru.  Sort of puts a damper on our operation.$B$BI think I might've found a loophole, however.$B$BYou see, we're not the only ethereals drawn to this colossal diamond.  A thief called Gava'xi has led a band of rogue ethereals into Oshu'gun and they've begun to dislodge large fragments from it.$B$BYour job, $r, is to go there and retrieve what is rightfully ours.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 10 Oshu'gun Crystal Fragments and bring them to Gezhe at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.</LogDescription>
