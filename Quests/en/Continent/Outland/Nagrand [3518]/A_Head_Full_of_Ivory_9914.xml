  <Title>A Head Full of Ivory</Title>
  <Description>Ivory is a much sought after prize.  I have many customers lined up in far off places to purchase it.$B$BI could be convinced to let you in on a cut of the profits.$B$BThe wild elekk roaming Nagrand have the high quality of tusks that I'm after.  Steer clear of the bull elekk; their ivory isn't in the condition that I desire.$B$BOh and don't worry, it's not poaching; I have an understanding with both the orcs and the draenei.$B$BDo you and I have an understanding?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 3 Pair of Ivory Tusks and return them to Shadrek at Aeris Landing in Nagrand.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It's ivory that I'm after, not excuses.  Of course, if you'd rather, we can renegotiate your percentage of the profits.  I doubt that you'd be pleased with the result.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Never doubted you for a second, friend.  Most of those look like fine specimens, if a bit dirty and scratched up.  Still, I think they're worth the value we agreed upon previously.$B$BI hope that we can continue to do business in the future.</RewardText>
