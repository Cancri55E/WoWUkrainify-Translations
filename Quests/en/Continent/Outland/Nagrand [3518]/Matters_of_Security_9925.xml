  <Title>Matters of Security</Title>
  <Description>Gezhe chose to base our operations as close to Oshu'gun as possible, without any regard for the safety of our crew.  Why?  Because he projected a ten percent increase in productivity by setting up shop here instead of in the mountains to the south.$B$BNever mind the crazed voidspawn wandering all of ten feet away from us.  That would be the security officer's problem, not Gezhe's.$B$BKill some voidspawn for me and I'll pay you a tenth of our security budget.  Don't get excited, it's not much of a budget.</Description>
