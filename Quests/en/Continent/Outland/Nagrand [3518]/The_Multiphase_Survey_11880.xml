  <Title>The Multiphase Survey</Title>
  <Description>I'm sure that 'gnomish inventor' is a crackpot. He was babbling about some dark distortions that have begun to appear in the Spirit Fields around Oshu'gun in Nagrand.$B$BAccording to him, these, uh, multiphase... um, spectro-goggles will allow the wearer to see the distortions and take readings from them. He insisted that recording this data was fundamental to our campaign at the Sunwell. I think he's nuts, but I'm under orders to investigate anything that might help. Would you mind taking some readings?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Harbinger Haronem in Shattrath City wants you to use the Multiphase Spectrographic Goggles to take 6 Multiphase Readings.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get those readings? That gnome will scream at me again if I don't get his precious data.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thanks for your help. You don't know what it's like to have to deal with "Doctor" Wafflefry over there. In between his "checkups" on my progress, he's busy hawking some gadget or another derived from his military inventions.</RewardText>
