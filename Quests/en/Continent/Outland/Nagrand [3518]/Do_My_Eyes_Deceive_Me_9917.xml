  <Title>Do My Eyes Deceive Me</Title>
  <Description>Do my eyes deceive me or is there an ogre hunting party over yonder? What could ogres be doing this far from their mound? I don't like this one bit, stranger. First Murkbloods and now ogres. We just don't have the manpower to handle all of these threats to our land.$B$BCould you investigate the ogre presence to the east for us? Their forward camp is about 200 paces east of here. You'll know you're at the right place if you see the Boulderfist hunters. Kill them to find the plans!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Huntress Bintook at Telaar in Nagrand wants you to recover Boulderfist Plans.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you found any new information?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Bintook reads the plans.&gt;$B$BBY THE LIGHT! Their penmanship is atrocious. From what I can gather, they're either planning to "eat the blue skins and take their village" or bake a blueberry pie. It really could go either way. We must get to the bottom of this!</RewardText>
