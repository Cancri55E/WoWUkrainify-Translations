  <Description>I have a feeling that these Lost Ones may not respond well to a draenei, but would welcome an arakkoa. I can create a potion that will allow you to take on the form of an arakkoa for a short time. It requires a couple of reagents which cannot be stored and must be used within hours of being gathered.$B$BYou will need to bring me a handful of sporebat eyes and some fen strider tentacles. Both species dwell in the wilderness surrounding Telredor.</Description>
