  <Title>Idols of the Feralfen</Title>
  <Description>From what you've told me about your observations at the Boha'mu Ruins, it seems this tribe of Lost Ones has reverted to the worship of animal spirits. Before we can approach them, we must know more of their beliefs.$B$BReturn to Feralfen Village and discreetly gather some of their idols so that I may study them. Try to avoid angering them, $n, as it may hurt our chances of making contact with them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 6 Feralfen Idols and return them to Anchorite Ahuurn at Telredor.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the idols?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These should be more than sufficient, $n. They seem to be fixated on birds, which is odd, because there aren't any bird species native to Zangarmarsh. What could this mean?$B$BCould they have encountered the arakkoa? To a shamanistic people, they might seem like the embodiment of a powerful bird spirit.</RewardText>
