  <Title>Observing the Sporelings</Title>
  <Description>We need to learn all that we can of the sporelings at Sporeggar and their relationship to the creatures around them.  One way to do that is what I'm doing; passive observation while making a note of their interactions.$B$BI need you to head over to the Spawning Glen to the west.  Investigate the whole area and then return to tell me what you saw.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Investigate the Spawning Glen in Zangarmarsh, and then report back to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh with your findings.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Back so soon? Your observation of the Sporeggar sporelings is critical to my research. I hope you aren't the type to rush things. Show patience and make certain that you have explored the entirety of the Spawning Glen before giving me your final report.</CompletionText>
