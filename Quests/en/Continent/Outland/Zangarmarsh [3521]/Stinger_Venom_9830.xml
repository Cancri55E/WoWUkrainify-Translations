  <Title>Stinger Venom</Title>
  <Description>When I speak to draenei, I often get the sense that they consider themselves removed from their environment. Many seem to pity my brethren, the Broken, who they say have lost something.$B$BWe Broken may have lost our inclination toward the Light, but our experiences have brought us closer to the land.$B$BMy people see opportunities where few draenei do. Take, for example, the venom of the marshlight bleeders that live to the south and west. It has a wide variety of uses from hunting to healing.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 6 Marshlight Bleeder Venom to Puluu at the Orebor Harborage.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I hope to demonstrate the uses of bleeder venom to Anchorite Ahuurn and the others at Telredor. That's going to require me to double my supply.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for bringing this venom, $n. It will go a long way toward making my demonstration possible without depleting my personal stores.</RewardText>
