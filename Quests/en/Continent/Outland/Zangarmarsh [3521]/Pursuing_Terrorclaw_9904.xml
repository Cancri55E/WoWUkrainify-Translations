  <Title>Pursuing Terrorclaw</Title>
  <Description>I've caught every kind of fish that lives in the marsh, but there's one that eludes me. Sure, I've caught eels and mudfin frenzies. But the last time I was out on one of the islands in Marshlight Lake, I hooked a gigantic bogstrok that snapped my line and got away.$B$BTerrorclaw, he's called, and I won't rest until he's dead. He's too big for any fisherman to catch, so I suppose we'll just have to kill him the old-fashioned way.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Terrorclaw and return to Zurjaya at Zabra'jin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I take it Terrorclaw lives no more?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>At last! They say every great fisherman has a story of "the one that got away," but I haven't yet met a creature I couldn't beat one way or another.</RewardText>
