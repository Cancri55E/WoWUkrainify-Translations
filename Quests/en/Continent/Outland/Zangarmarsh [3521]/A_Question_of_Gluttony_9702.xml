  <Title>A Question of Gluttony</Title>
  <Description>I was wondering why the bog lords were crossing the road to go to the Spawning Glen - they must be starving for some reason.  This just will not do!$B$BI mean, normally I wouldn't get involved, but if they continue to eat all of the sporeling pods they'll wipe them out!$B$BHere's what we'll do: I'll stay here and you head to the Quagg Ridge to the east and look for dietary clues as to why they're raiding the sporelings.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 10 pieces of Discarded Nutriment and then return to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Be sure that you collect all of the evidence carefully, $c!  We're fitting the pieces of a giant puzzle together here.  A mistake on your part could lead us to the wrong conclusions.$B$BThen where would we be in our understanding of Zangarmarsh's ecology?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is what you found?  That's odd.  These husked mushroom remains are both unusual and somehow look familiar.$B$BI have to think on this a moment.  Don't go anywhere!</RewardText>
