  <Title>An Unnatural Drought</Title>
  <Description>The soil sample you brought me is nearly devoid of moisture, $n. If the soil itself is losing moisture, then the creatures that live in the Dead Mire must be suffering terribly.$B$BI've seen what happens when the region's fungal giants begin to wither and die. The pain drives them mad, causing them to attack anything in their path.$B$BThese creatures have no idea what's happening to them. They're beyond our ability to save, so the best we can do is to end their suffering.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Vindicator Idaar at Telredor wants you to kill 12 Withered Giants.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It pains me to kill the creatures of the Dead Mire, but they are beyond saving. The best we can do is work to restore the area and nurture a new generation.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for helping with this difficult task, $n. Our work in the Dead Mire is not yet done, but now our efforts will focus on doing what we can to restore balance to the area.</RewardText>
