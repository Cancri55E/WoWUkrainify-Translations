  <Title>Saving the Sporeloks</Title>
  <Description>Ikeyen's been telling me stories about what happened to him down in those caves and I think it's just awful!$B$BYou know, maybe we should do something to help out those poor sporeloks.  Ikeyen says that they live there in the Funggor Cavern, but that the marsh beasts have recently invaded.$B$BWhy don't you go down there and see if you can clear some of those marsh beasts out?  It's just to the southwest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 10 Marsh Dredgers and 10 Marsh Lurkers, and then return to Lauranna Thar'well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What?  Back so soon?  How did it go?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good!  Those marsh beasts have no right to invade the home of the sporeloks!$B$BIt would be better if these creatures would learn to live in harmony, but when that's not possible, we'll be here to take care of the situation!$B$BHere, please take one of these as thanks for your help.</RewardText>
