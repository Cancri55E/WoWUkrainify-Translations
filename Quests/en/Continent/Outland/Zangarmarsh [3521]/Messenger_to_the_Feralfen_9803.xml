  <Title>Messenger to the Feralfen</Title>
  <Description>The time has come for us to embrace the Feralfen and teach them that the Light has not forsaken them. Take the potion I've prepared and carry it with you to the Boha'mu Ruins.$B$BOnce you arrive at the ruins, drink the potion to assume the form of one of their bird spirits. Speak with Elder Kuruti and let him know the draenei are ready to welcome his people as our long lost brothers.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Drink Ahuurn's Elixir while standing in the Boha'mu Ruins. Speak to Elder Kuruti while you are in the form of an arakkoa.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you speak with the Feralfen elder?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>They refused? They are welcome to choose their own path, of course, but their choice surprises me. I would think that all the draenei, including the Broken and Lost Ones, would still remember that we're all a part of the same people.$B$BI suppose he is right about the folly of deceiving them, but still, could he not see that our intentions were friendly?</RewardText>
