  <Title>Too Many Mouths to Feed</Title>
  <Description>On my last hunting trip, I caught sight of a new outpost being built by a group of trolls. No doubt they've begun hunting these lands, too.$B$BIf they establish a permanent presence out here, the competition for food will be fierce. We cannot take direct action against them without provocation, but we can remove some of the natural competition for food.$B$BFor each mire hydra you kill, that's three fewer mouths to feed!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Mire Hydra and return to Haalrun at Telredor.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How goes the hunt, friend?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done. That should ease the demand on the food supply around here for the immediate future, although we're going to need to find new sources of food. Fish and mushrooms suffice, but variety can never be underestimated.</RewardText>
