  <Title>Jyoba's Report</Title>
  <Description>Flecks of withered fungus dot the body of Scout Jyoba. Whatever killed him must've been made of the same dying fungus as the giant wilting mushrooms of the Dead Mire. Perhaps one of the withered giants caught him by surprise as he sat writing his report.$B$BWithout the text of the report, it's nearly impossible to tell what the scout discovered. If the report can be found, it should be returned to Zurai.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve Scout Jyoba's Report from the Withered Giants and return it to Zurai at Swamprat Post.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You're back, but Jyoba's not with you. What became of him?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Zurai accepts the report from you and glances over it.&gt;$B$BMuch of this is information we already know. Everything in the area seems to be dried or wilting, but here's something new.$B$BHe says the fungal giants seem to have gone berserk from the lack of moisture. From your description, that must be what killed him.$B$BI'll instruct my men to avoid the area. We can't afford any more casualties.</RewardText>
