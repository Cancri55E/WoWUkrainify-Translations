  <Title>The Sharpest Blades</Title>
  <Description>The damp atmosphere of the marsh has taken a toll on my metal tools. It's made woodworking a lot more difficult than it ought to be, so I've given up on metal blades.$B$BIt turns out that the marshfang slicers living to the south and west of town grow blades that are sharper than any steel I've ever owned. They're also resistant to rust and wear. It's just a little tricky to attach them to a handle, but I think I've got it figured out. I'd appreciate any blades you could bring me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 10 Marshfang Slicer Blades to Gambarinka at Zabra'jin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you managed to scare up some of those marshfang blades?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These should keep me supplied for some time to come! I think some of the others have begun to take notice. I've had several offers to buy my blades already. Selling them on the side might provide better business than my customary goods.</RewardText>
