  <Title>Withered Flesh</Title>
  <Description>We must determine how far the damage has spread. The basidium you brought me comes from a bog giant. Their larger, hardier cousins, the bog lords, should prove more resistant to the degeneration that's struck the giants.$B$BIt would be good to know how the changes in the Dead Mire have affected the other creatures out there, too.$B$BReturn to the Dead Mire and see if you can get samples from the bog lords and the hydra in the area.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 5 Parched Hydra Samples and 5 Withered Bog Lord Samples and bring them to Ruam at Telredor.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to gather the samples?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Ruam examines the samples, looking distressed.&gt;$B$BIt's exactly as I'd feared, $n. The drying environment is taking a heavy toll on creatures never meant to live outside swampy environments. We'll have to continue to monitor the area and consult with the Cenarion Expedition to see if anything can be done.</RewardText>
