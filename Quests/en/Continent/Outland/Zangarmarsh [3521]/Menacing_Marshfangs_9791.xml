  <Title>Menacing Marshfangs</Title>
  <Description>During the orcs' war against my people, gatherers rarely left Telredor for fear of being attacked or captured. Now, we venture out more often, but the marsh is no less perilous.$B$BIt seems that the nether rays have grown bolder in recent months. I don't know if it has something to do with more competition for their normal prey, but they've been attacking our foraging parties on a regular basis. If we can thin their ranks in the area around Telredor, perhaps they would learn to leave us alone.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Marshfang Rippers and return to Noraani at Telredor.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you been successful in your marshfang hunt?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for your help in clearing out some of the marshfang rippers, $n. If they had any intelligence, perhaps they'd learn that it's best to live and let live.$B$B&lt;Noraani shrugs.&gt;$B$BGiant, overgrown bugs with intelligence. I wonder what that would be like...</RewardText>
