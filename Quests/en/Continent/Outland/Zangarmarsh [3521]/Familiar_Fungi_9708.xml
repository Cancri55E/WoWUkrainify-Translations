  <Description>Yes, that's it, I knew I had seen this particular phylum of mushroom elsewhere in the marsh!$B$BTo the north is a place known as the Hewn Bog.  Odd name for the place if you ask me, but I've never been there.  I'll need samples of those mushrooms to confirm my hypothesis.$B$BJust be careful, $c.  I'd heard that ogres have moved in to the area, so you'll have to get the samples from them.  Could that be why the bog lords are no longer going there for their food?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 15 Mushroom Samples and return them to Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in Zangarmarsh.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have those samples yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We definitely have a match here.  And the presence of the ogres and what they were doing there explains everything.  Now I get why it's called the Hewn Bog, duh!$B$BWe have to do something about this situation, but what?  We can't just wipe out all of those ogres; they have every bit as much a right to be here as any of the other creatures in the marsh!</RewardText>
