  <Title>Plants of Zangarmarsh</Title>
  <Description>The lakes of Zangarmarsh are slowly being drained of their water.  We don't quite know why, but we do know that many plants species are in danger of becoming extinct.$B$BAs the expedition's cataloguer, it is my job to track and identify these plants so we can better understand what's happening to them.$B$BIf you'd like to help, bring me unidentified plant parts.  They can be picked right from the ground if you're an herbalist, and the indigenous creatures of the swamp may also carry plant parts on them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 10 Unidentified Plant Parts to Lauranna Thar'well at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find any plant parts, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The decrease in native species is certainly a cause for concern.  The increase in invasive species could be related to the recent disturbance in the ecosystem.  I don't have enough information to make a conclusion, yet.$B$B&lt;Lauranna jots down some notes on a journal as she goes through the plant parts.&gt;$B$BTake these, $n.  They might be of some use to you.$B$BBring me any other plant parts you find.  I'll incorporate them into my statistics.</RewardText>
