  <Title>Overlord Gorefist</Title>
  <Description>The centerpiece of any ogre tribe is its leader. Without leadership, the Ango'rosh's organization will disappear and they'll resort to infighting to determine who will lead next.$B$BAlthough we've seen the ogres out and about in this area, their true strength is concentrated in their Ango'rosh Stronghold to the northwest. It's located in a cave on a small island connected to the marsh by a fallen mushroom.$B$BGo there and defeat Overlord Gorefist. That should provide us with a well-deserved respite.</Description>
