  <Title>The Respect of Another</Title>
  <Description>Magasha is the fiercest troll in the Marsh, but she only respects mighty hunters. 

I tried to prove myself to her, but the one beast that could impress her is beyond my skill. Maybe you could help me out? It's the giant bog wasp known as Blacksting that roams the area south of the glowing draenei towers to the west. If you bring me its stinger maybe she'll give me a chance to join her hunters.

I know it's a little sneaky, but I promise to learn under her and do ya both proud.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Blacksting's Stinger to Reavij at Swamprat Post.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>My luck is about to change - I can feel it.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Fantastic! I'll never forget how you helped me to win her heart. In fact, you can be a guest of honor at our wedding.</RewardText>
