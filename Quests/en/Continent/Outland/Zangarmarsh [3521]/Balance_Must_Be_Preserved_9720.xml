  <Title>Balance Must Be Preserved</Title>
  <Description>I cannot begin to comprehend why the naga would drain the water out of their own habitat.  What I do understand is a need to put a stop to their operations.$B$BThese seeds carry with them the rage of the earth.  Take them to the steam pumps operated by the naga and use them on their controls.$B$BThe vines that grow from the seeds will be as thick as your arm and as strong as iron.  Go, $n.  Restore the balance that the naga have upset.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ysiel Windsinger wants you to use the Ironvine Seeds on the Steam Pump Controls at Serpent Lake, Umbrafen Lake, Marshlight Lake and the Lagoon.  Then return to her at the Cenarion Refuge in Zangarmarsh with any leftover seeds you have.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is it done, $c?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It is done, then.  The marsh has been saved for now.$B$BDon't think for a second that this will be the last we hear of the naga.  We must remain vigilant of our enemy as we continue with our mission in Outland.  </RewardText>
