  <Title>Diaphanous Wings</Title>
  <Description>Living in such a remote location has taught us to make use of everything available. Of course, you have to learn to stop thinking about where some of these materials come from first.$B$BI've found that the wings of the umbraglow stingers are very helpful for waterproofing. They're strong, thin, and flexible.$B$B&lt;Haalrun chuckles.&gt;$B$BI see the look on your face. Like I said, it takes time to get used to the idea. If you're going to be out and about, would you mind bringing me some of the wings?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Haalrun at Telredor wants you to bring him 8 Diaphanous Wings from any of the firefly species in Zangarmarsh.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you manage to gather any diaphanous wings?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $n.$B$B&lt;Haalrun smiles sympathetically.&gt;$B$BAt least you don't have to clean them. That's the worst job of the lot, but once it's done, you'd never know they were attached to a giant insect.</RewardText>
