  <Title>The Dead Mire</Title>
  <Description>I have lived among the anchorites of Telredor for some time, $n, and in that time I've come to know the marsh quite well. Recently, I've started to notice a disturbing change in the land to the northeast.$B$BVirtually all life there has begun to wither and die, seemingly without explanation. I have a few ideas as to what might be happening, but they are little more than speculation. If you were to bring me a sample of the soil in that area, I may be able to get to the bottom of this mystery.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring a Dead Mire Soil Sample to Vindicator Idaar at Telredor.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to get a sample of the soil in the Dead Mire?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hmm... The soil seems to be depleted, so it can't be the cause of the problem, as I'd thought. What's the common link here? Why is everything suddenly dying?</RewardText>
