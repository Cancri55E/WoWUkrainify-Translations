  <Title>Message to the Daggerfen</Title>
  <Description>Of all the Lost One tribes in Zangarmarsh, the Daggerfen are the most cunning and most aggressive. They are highly organized and make no secret of the fact that they desire control over the other Lost Ones in the marsh.$B$BTheir attacks have already taken quite a toll on my scouts and messengers. I cannot afford to lose any more men.$B$BIf we don't act soon, they'll have complete control over the roads and Zabra'jin will effectively be surrounded.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 3 Daggerfen Assassins and 15 Daggerfen Muckdwellers and return to Shadow Hunter Denjai at Zabra'jin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The only thing the Daggerfen understand is swift and brutal action. They should know that we will not let them have their way.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I think you've managed to send a fairly strong message to them. Perhaps now, the rest of my men won't be so afraid to take the fight to the Daggerfen. Or, if they are, they'll find themselves ashamed by their lack of bravery.</RewardText>
