  <Title>Stinging the Stingers</Title>
  <Description>It's impossible to work with all this infernal buzzing! Do you hear it?$B$BI can't get it out of my head! I know exactly what's making the noise, too. It's those damnable marshlight bleeders! The noise always comes from the south and west of the village.$B$BThey're too big to swat, crush underfoot, or wave away. The only way to stop that unholy droning is to kill them. I don't care how you do it, $n, just quiet them!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 8 Marshlight Bleeders and return to Gambarinka at Zabra'jin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The sound seems to have receded into the distance. Is that wishful thinking or have you really done something about the problem?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I thought so. I can hear the difference already. I'll finally be able to get back to work, thanks to you. If you ever find yourself in need of tradeskill supplies, don't forget ol' Gambarinka!</RewardText>
