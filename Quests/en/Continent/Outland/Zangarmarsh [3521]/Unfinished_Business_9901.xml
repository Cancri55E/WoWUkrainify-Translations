  <Title>Unfinished Business</Title>
  <Description>The first expedition the league sent reported encountering a gigantic spore bat they'd taken to calling Sporewing. They had to leave in a hurry, so they didn't have the chance to kill him while they were here, so I figured I'd finish the job for them.$B$BWhat's left of their report suggests that the creature can be found in the southwestern parts of the Dead Mire. I think Vindicator Idaar mentioned that it's to the northeast of Telredor.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Prospector Conall at Telredor wants you to kill Sporewing.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you manage to track down Sporewing?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n. I think you and I have managed to outshine a whole team of prospectors. When I get back to Ironforge, I'm sure I'll get my choice of assignments.</RewardText>
