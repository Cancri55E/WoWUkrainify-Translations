  <Title>Menacing Marshfangs</Title>
  <Description>Sometimes I wish Denjai had sent a shaman with us, or at least given us a totem to keep the marshfang rippers at bay.$B$BThe whole place is crawling with the pests! It's just not right. Shouldn't something be eating these despicable things?$B$BWe've all been taking turns playing exterminator. You showed up at just the right time, $n. Congratulations! Now get out there and mop up some marshfangs!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Reavij at Swamprat Post wants you to kill 10 Marshfang Rippers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I still see marshfangs, $N. Surely you can't be done so soon.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Had your fill already?$B$B&lt;Reavij laughs.&gt;$B$BThere's a reason why our visitors don't stay long.$B$BIf I had a choice, I'd find a more agreeable spot for the post, but I'll take marshfangs over Denjai's temper any day.</RewardText>
