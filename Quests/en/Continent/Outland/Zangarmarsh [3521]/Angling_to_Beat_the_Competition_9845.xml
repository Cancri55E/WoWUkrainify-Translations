  <Title>Angling to Beat the Competition</Title>
  <Description>It's a relief to be in someplace with water after trekking through the wasteland of Hellfire Peninsula. I was worried there might not be any respectable fishing holes in Outland.$B$BNow I'm glad I lugged my fishing supplies along. For the most part, the fishing's been good, except for those no good fenclaw thrashers in Serpent Lake.$B$BNot only do they scare the fish away, but they're bold enough to snap the bait right off my hook. I spend more time re-baiting the hook than I do catching anything!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Fenclaw Thrashers and return to Zurjaya at Zabra'jin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is it safe for me to fish again?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I can't wait to return to fishing! Now I'll be able to return to town with some real fish in my bucket and Gambarinka won't be able to make fun of me anymore!</RewardText>
