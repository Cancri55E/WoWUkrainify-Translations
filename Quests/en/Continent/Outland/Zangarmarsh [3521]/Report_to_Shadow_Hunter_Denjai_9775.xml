  <Title>Report to Shadow Hunter Denjai</Title>
  <Description>Shadow Hunter Denjai will no doubt expect to receive a report about my progress in establishing our outpost. I've prepared a short summary of what we've accomplished here already, but with the loss of Scout Jyoba, I can't spare a runner to take the report to Denjai's base of Zabra'jin to the west.$B$BIf you're headed that way, would you mind bringing this to him? Shadow Hunter Denjai can be a little intimidating at first, but once you get used to him, he's not so bad.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Zurai's Report to Shadow Hunter Denjai at Zabra'jin in Zangarmarsh.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You don't look like one of my men. Speak your piece, $r.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Why didn't you say you had a report from Zurai? I've been waiting to hear from him.$B$BI sent him out there to give us a presence on the eastern border, not sit on his hands. Let's see what he has to say.</RewardText>
