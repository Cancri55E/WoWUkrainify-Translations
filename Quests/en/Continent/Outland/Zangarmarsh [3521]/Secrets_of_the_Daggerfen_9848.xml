  <Title>Secrets of the Daggerfen</Title>
  <Description>Bugs, bugs, bugs! The marsh is full of them and my companions here seem obsessed with them.$B$BWell, I've had it with the bugs! Something far more intriguing has captured my interest. To the west, there is a village of Lost Ones who call themselves the Daggerfen.$B$BThe whole tribe consists of highly specialized assassins. I've noticed them mixing and using a particularly potent kind of poison. I'm dying to know more about the poison, but that's going to require a copy of the recipe and a sample vial.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Daggerfen Poison Manual and a Daggerfen Poison Vial to Timothy Daniels at the Orebor Harborage.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did your search of Daggerfen Village yield the information I need in order to get to the bottom of this poison puzzle?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Timothy leafs through the manual.&gt;$B$BThey're using ragveil as a base for the poison? No, that can't be right. Ragveil has no toxic properties.$B$BIncluding ragveil in a poison is like a rogue wielding two maces. Sure, you can do it, but it isn't true to the essence of your calling! I just can't understand...$B$B&lt;Timothy clears his throat.&gt;$B$BI mean, thank you for fetching these for me. I'll try out the poison as soon as time permits.</RewardText>
