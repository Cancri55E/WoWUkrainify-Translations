  <Title>The Terror of Marshlight Lake</Title>
  <Description>Traveling through naga-infested lands has shown me the cruel truth about how my less fortunate brethren are treated. At Marshlight Lake, to the southwest, I observed a particularly malicious taskmaster playing a deadly game. He orders his slaves out to the islands in Marshlight Lake when he knows that Terrorclaw, a giant bogstrok, is ready to feed.$B$BI needn't describe what results. We are too few to take on the naga directly, but we can deprive them of their amusement by killing their pet.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Terrorclaw and return to Puluu at the Orebor Harborage.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I am ashamed that I cannot do more to help my enslaved brethren. but at least we have prevented more needless deaths.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $n. Perhaps with the help of the draenei, this marsh will one day be free of naga. I can't imagine what it must be like to be forced to serve them.$B$BHe doesn't talk about it often, but Maktu was once a slave.</RewardText>
