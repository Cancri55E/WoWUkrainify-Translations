  <Title>Spirits of the Feralfen</Title>
  <Description>The most powerful tribe of Lost Ones in the marsh, the Feralfen, are said to possess powerful medicine. There may be no truth to such rumors, but anything that might help me channel the spirits of this world cannot be ignored.$B$BFind the Feralfen mystics, hunters and druids, $n, and capture their totems. Everything I need to know should be apparent from the carvings.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 10 Feralfen Protection Totems to Seer Janidi at Zabra'jin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you gathered those totems?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hmm... They seem to be divided between images of a serpent spirit and a bird spirit. No self-respecting Darkspear troll engages in bird worship. Their spirits are weak, capricious, and best left to the Amani.$B$BBut the serpent, $N, the serpent wields considerable power and this is the spirit I shall study.</RewardText>
