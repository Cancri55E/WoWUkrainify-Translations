  <Title>The Agony and the Darkness</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, $n. I've deciphered the Legion missive and uncovered the demons' strategic plans for this Peninsula. Apparently, there is a large group of hellish terrorfiends gathering near the Pools of Aggonar in the west. We cannot allow such a force to go unchallenged. You must go there and decimate their cursed numbers. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Magister Bloodhawk wants you to kill 10 Terrorfiends in the Pools of Aggonar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Well, $C - have the terrorfiends been defeated?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Bravo, $N. I knew you would be victorious! The Legion's defeat draws ever nearer!
