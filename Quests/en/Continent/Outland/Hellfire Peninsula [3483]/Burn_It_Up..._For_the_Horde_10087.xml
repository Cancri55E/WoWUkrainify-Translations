  <Title>Burn It Up... For the Horde!</Title>
  <Description>I'm a lucky, lucky goblin.  I get to make explosives and killing machines, knowing they'll be used immediately on important missions!$B$BSpeaking of missions, I just got one from Thrallmar command: burn the Alliance cannons on the far side of the Path of Glory... the ones pointing dangerously close to Horde fortifications.  Take this torch and make your way to each cannon.  Fire the torch and watch the sparks fly!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Flaming Torch to burn the Eastern Alliance Cannon and the Western Alliance Cannon, and then return to Megzeg Nukklebust in Thrallmar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I've been looking for the telltale signs of burning cannons -- smoke plumes, or the cries of burning fel orcs...$B$BAny luck on your mission?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I thought so!  I couldn't quite make out the destruction from here, but I can imagine how it must have looked.  Splendid!$B$BWell done, $n.  Thrallmar command will be happy to hear of your success!</RewardText>
