  <Title>The Foot of the Citadel</Title>
  <Description>Force-Commander Gorax is training Shattered Hand captains at the base of Hellfire Citadel, honing them to a bloody razor's edge.  You must kill him, $n, for his loss would be a mighty blow to the fel orcs.$B$BHowever, that is not all you must do.$B$BTake this banner.  Place it atop Gorax's corpse.  Gorax's commander, the Hand of Kargath, must answer your challenge if he has even a drop of true orc blood within him!$B$BHis head, the head of the hand of Kargath, is what I seek.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Force-Commander Gorax, place the Challenge From the Horde upon his corpse, kill The Hand of Kargath, and then bring the Head of the Hand of Kargath to Nazgrel in Thrallmar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you faced the Hand of Kargath, $N?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You have done a great deed, $N. The fel orcs are a shame to all true orcs. If we have one fear, it is the fear of succumbing to demonic corruption once again. So you see, our war against the fel orcs is more than merely a battle with fierce foes -- it is also a battle within ourselves.$B$BAnd with strength, strength you have shown time again, it is a battle we will win.</RewardText>
