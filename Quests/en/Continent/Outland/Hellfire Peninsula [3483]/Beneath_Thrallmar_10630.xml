  <Title>Beneath Thrallmar</Title>
  <Description>I'm almost back in business.  Problem is all these gan'arg are in my mine.  I can't send my peons in and even once I fix this shredder I wouldn't want to risk it in combat. Deep down in the mine the gan'arg have a leader.  If you kill him maybe the gan'arg will leave.  Then I could make some money and buy my way out of here. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Urga'zz and return to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is he dead yet? I'm too scared to look.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>All those gan'arg are sure to clear out now.  I'll be back in Booty Bay within a week.  I can't wait to go fishing again.  Coming to Outland was a mistake.  If you'll take my advice, you'll head back the way you came.  Spend some time in Stranglethorn, or maybe, if you feel adventurous, head to Un'Goro Crater.  Just don't stay here.  </RewardText>
