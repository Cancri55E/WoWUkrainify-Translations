  <Title>How to Serve Goblins</Title>
  <Description>Why would fel orcs steal my shredder parts?  I hate them so much.  They just sneak into my camp here and take things all the time.  A couple of days ago they stole three of my peons!  Now the rest of my peons have run off because they are afraid they are going to be eaten by fel orcs.  $B$BI can't run a mine without peons.  If you could save the peons that I lost maybe the others would come back.  The fel orcs have their camps along the wall to the southwest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rescue Manni, Moh and Jakk from the Fel Orc camps and return to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you saved my peons yet? Please hurry, I'm afraid they are going to be eaten and they probably won't taste very good. If they taste really bad the fel orcs might get really mad at me.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for saving my peons.  Now maybe I can get them to fix my shredder with those parts you found, earn some money and get out of Outland.  I can't wait to be back in Booty Bay.</RewardText>
