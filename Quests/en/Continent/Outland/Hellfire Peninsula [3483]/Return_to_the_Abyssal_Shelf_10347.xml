  <Title>Return to the Abyssal Shelf</Title>
  <Description>$n, are you ready for another sortie over the Abyssal Shelf?  I fear that, if we do not maintain pressure on the Legion forces there and allow them to strengthen their hold, then we may suffer a large demon attack from the north.$B$BWhat say you, $c?  Do you want to take another windrider and hammer the Abyssal Shelf one more time?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wing Commander Brack at Reaver's Fall in Hellfire Peninsula has asked that you destroy 20 Gan'arg Peons, 5 Mo'arg Overseers and 5 Fel Cannons.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The Legion must not think they are safe high atop the Abyssal Shelf.  We must hit them repeatably!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The other windrider pilots speak highly of you, $n.  You've scored quite a lot of kills on the Abyssal Shelf.  Keep up the good works!</RewardText>
