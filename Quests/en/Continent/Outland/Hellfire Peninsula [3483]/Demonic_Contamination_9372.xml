  <Title>Demonic Contamination</Title>
  <Description>Welcome to the Cenarion Post, $c. We don't often get company out here, but I'm grateful for the visit. My work with the creatures of this desolate land requires me to travel to many remote places.$B$BThe Cenarion Expedition has dispatched me to study some of the most dangerous wildlife in Outland, and I've made a startling discovery. While many creatures here have already undergone radical changes, they continue to mutate. I'm collecting blood samples to document the changes, and any help would be welcome.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Thiah Redmane, at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula, has asked you to gather 6 Helboar Blood Samples from Hulking Helboars.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to collect the blood samples?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n. These blood samples will prove helpful in my research and in the Expedition's wider studies of Outland's creatures.$B$BIf I could isolate what causes these creatures to change continuously, perhaps I could concoct an antidote.</RewardText>
