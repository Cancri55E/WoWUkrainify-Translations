  <Title>A Pilgrim's Plight</Title>
  <Description>That wounded pilgrim seems to be shouting something about a pack.$B$BWhen you encountered her, did you see a pack nearby? Hmm...$B$BShe must've left it when fleeing from her attackers. The quillfang ravagers, in their ravine to the south, are known to attack solitary travelers.$B$BIf she doesn't calm down, I won't be able to tend her wounds. Her stubbornness may just cost her her life.$B$BGo to Dustquill Ravine and see if you can find her campsite. I'm willing to bet she left it there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>The Wounded Blood Elf Pilgrim was attacked by Quillfang Ravagers while camped in Dustquill Ravine. Find her camp and search it for the missing pack.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Things aren't going well. At this rate, she'll never make it back onto the road. Were you able to find that pack?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for returning this, $N. I'm not sure what significance it holds for the wounded pilgrim, but she refuses to let anyone get near her until it's in her hands again.</RewardText>
