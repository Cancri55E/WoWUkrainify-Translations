The demons have positioned a number of their fel cannons along the ridge - and they're aimed straight at us! You must enter the camp and destroy these fel cannons. $B$B$n, you must be sure to detonate them all - or nothing will stop the Legion from raining fiery hell down upon our heads!

  <CompletionText>The Legion could start shelling us at any time, $N! You need to destroy those blasted cannons!</CompletionText>
