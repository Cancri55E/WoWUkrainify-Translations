  <Title>Birds of a Feather</Title>
  <Description>The Haal'eshi arakkoa have domesticated a beautiful bird species called the kaliri.$B$BI've managed to capture a young male and they appear to be trainable.  The females are much rarer, but if I had one I could attempt to breed them.  She has to be young, though... a hatchling.  An older wild bird wouldn't survive in captivity.$B$BTake this cage and travel south, to the Den of Haal'esh.  Search the nests for eggs that are ready to hatch.  If you bring me back a female hatchling, I'll reward you handsomely.</Description>
