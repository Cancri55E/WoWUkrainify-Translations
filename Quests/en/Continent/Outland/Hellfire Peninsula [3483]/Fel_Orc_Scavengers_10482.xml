  <Title>Fel Orc Scavengers</Title>
  <Description>Scavengers, orcs of the Bonechewer clan, skulk about the ruined battlements overlooking the Path of Glory. We must assume that these fel orcs are gathering war machine parts for their masters within Hellfire Citadel--they must be stopped!$B$BFind Bonechewer orcs to the north, $n. Find them and slay them! But use caution, for although these orcs are the lesser of the fel clans, their strength is the match of any orc we've faced thus far.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 20 Bonechewer Orcs and return to Amadi in Honor Hold.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The Bonechewers appear in large numbers, $N. Slay them or the fel orcs may overrun us!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Very good.  I'm sure their loss will be felt in Hellfire Citadel.  Although that dark bastion looms over us and seems nigh insurmountable, it is only with bold moves like you have made that we will find victory over the fel orcs!</RewardText>
