  <Title>The Warp Rifts</Title>
  <Description>Long have I wandered through Outland, searching for the truth of the void.  Now I am old and weak.  Perhaps you will help me? $B$BI must learn the secrets of the voidwalkers.  You must find the Warp Fields to the west.  West of the Expedition Armory there is a dark place on the edge of the abyss where time and space are weak.  Use my unstable warp rift generator in the Warp Fields to create a warp rift.  You must gather warp nether from the creatures that come through.  </Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Unstable Warp Rift Generator in the Warp Fields.  Gather 3 Warp Nethers from Unstable Voidwalkers and return them to Ogath the Mad in Spinebreaker Post.  </LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you managed to use my experimental device yet?  I think my unstable warp rift generator will work out there so close to the abyss. </CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Unbelievable.  You have touched the void itself!  $N, you have saved my life's work.  But there is more that must be done, and you can help me.  </RewardText>
