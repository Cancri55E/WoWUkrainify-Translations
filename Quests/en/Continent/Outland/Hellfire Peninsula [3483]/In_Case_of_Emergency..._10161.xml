  <Title>In Case of Emergency...</Title>
  <Description>In the event of an emergency, it's always the pilot's job to keep a level head, especially when the only orders your co-pilot follows come from his stomach.$B$BThe good news is that we won't need to wait days for replacement parts to be imported. The bad news is that the "spare" parts got scattered from here to the Valley of Bones to the east.$B$BThe other bad news? The spare parts aren't so spare. They, uh, fell off during our rapid descent. Could you help me collect enough to get us off the ground again?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 30 pieces of Zeppelin Debris and bring them to "Screaming" Screed Luckheed at the Zeppelin Crash.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find enough of the parts? If not, I might have to use that frying pan Legassi keeps waving around. Then, I'd have to rename the zeppelin the "Flying Skillet."</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Some of this is in pretty bad shape, but there should be enough to work with here. With some creative engineering, I'm confident I can make it work!</RewardText>
