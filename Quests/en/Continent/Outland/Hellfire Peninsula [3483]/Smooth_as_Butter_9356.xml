He calls it a "rough" landing.$B$BSure, we got shot at, but I'd be willing to cut him a little more slack if he didn't brag about his piloting skills so often!$B$BI think I'm going to make him a batch of wings to drive the point home. To the east, in the Valley of Bones, you'll find bonestripper buzzards. Their wings are plump, juicy, and perfect for my needs.</Description>
