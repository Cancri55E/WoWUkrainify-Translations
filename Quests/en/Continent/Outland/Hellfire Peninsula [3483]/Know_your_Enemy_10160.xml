  <Title>Know your Enemy</Title>
  <Description>Rumors have surfaced that some new breed of orc is on the rise. Larger, meaner - more cunning than the brutes we're familiar with.  If these rumors are true then our forces, already stretched, may be taxed beyond their limit.$B$BI have entrusted my lieutenant, Amadi, with investigating this matter. If you would help us in this dark hour, seek her out. She is stationed at the broken tower just west of the Hold.$B$BAnd $n - be careful out there. You're heading into a dangerous new world.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Lieutenant Amadi at the old guard tower just west of Honor Hold.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Lieutenant Amadi nods.&gt;$B$BGood, we need all the help we can get. The increasing fel orc presence around the Southern Rampart concerns me. I sent out a scout to investigate, but he hasn't yet returned.</RewardText>
