  <Title>Cruel's Intentions</Title>
  <Description>Magister Bloodhawk finally deciphered the Legion missive you found earlier. It turned out to be attack plans sent by one of Highlord Kazzak's lieutenants - Arazzius the Cruel. Apparently, Arazzius commands the Legion ground forces in Hellfire. The time has come to terminate his command, $n. Terminate with extreme prejudice. $B$BHead west to the Pools of Aggonar and put an end to this so-called 'Legion lord'. Today, the Horde reclaims Hellfire Peninsula. Let the Legion be damned. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Arazzius the Cruel, then return to Nazgrel in Thrallmar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Destiny calls, $N. Arazzius the Cruel has eluded justice long enough. Let his death be a message to all those who would oppose the Horde. You are next.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>For generations to come, they will sing songs of this day, $N - songs of your valor. I wish Thrall had been here to celebrate this victory with us. The Legion is undone - and Hellfire now belongs to the Horde once again! There may yet be hope for this ravaged world - and our peoples' place within it. $B$BLok'tar ogar!
