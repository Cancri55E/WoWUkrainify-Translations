  <Title>Bloody Vengeance</Title>

Long ago, many Alliance warriors lost their lives at this tower and their banner was captured by Urtrak, a foul orc commander.$B$BBlow the Unyielding battle horn near the Alliance banner.  This will get the attention of Urtrak.  It may also summon forth warriors who fell in battle long ago.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Blow the Unyielding Battle Horn near the Alliance Banner.  Kill Urtrak and then return to Althen the Historian at Spinebreaker Post.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you blown the horn by the siege tower yet?  We must do this soon.  Who knows when Thrallmar will have need of the Unyielding.  </CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I am glad to hear that the Unyielding joined you in your battle.  I thought they might come to the sound of their own battle horn, but I could not be sure.  Perhaps we have given some of them the vengeance they so desperately crave.  $B$BYou have slain Urtrak and we must report your victory to Commander Hogarth in the Expedition Armory.  He will understand the risks you have taken on his behalf.</RewardText>
