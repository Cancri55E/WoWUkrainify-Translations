  <Title>Crimson Crystal Clue</Title>
  <Description>As the colossus falls under the weight of your attacks, you notice for the first time that it was holding a red crystal fragment.$B$BWhile it was small and unnoticeable in the mountain giant's hand, it's a fairly hefty piece for you to carry around.  It also suspiciously looks like it's a piece of the giant crystal in the middle of the ridge.$B$BIt's most definitely a clue as to the strangeness that is occurring here, and you're sure that the druids at the Cenarion Post to the south will want to see it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver the Crimson Crystal Shard to Tola'thion at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>That's a big crystal you have there.  Did you get that while you were up at the ridge killing colossi?$B$BLet me take a look at it.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hmph.  Just looks like a big lump of unrefined crystal to me.$B$BAdmittedly, I can feel a sickly, evil aura emanating off of it, but that's not exactly in my line of work.  I'm just here to put an end to the mountain giant menace.</RewardText>
