  <Title>Disruption - Forge Camp: Mageddon</Title>
  <Description>Pay close attention, $n. We've been surveying the Legion camps that lie along the ridge ahead. We have reason to believe that these so-called 'Forge Camps' are where the demons are constructing those blasted Fel Reavers. $B$BYou can see the closest target, Forge Camp: Mageddon, to the west. Our intelligence suggests that it's still under construction. If you can slay the Gan'arg Servants and their master - Razorsaw - we can bring the Legion's Fel Reaver production to a grinding halt!   

</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Gan'arg Servants and Razorsaw at Forge Camp Mageddon and return to Forward Commander Brock at Honor Point.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Don't tell me your getting cold feet, $C? If they finish construction on that Forge Camp, you'll have more to worry about than just those Fel Reavers! Get to it!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, I must say, I am impressed, $n. I didn't think you had the mettle for this mission. Well done. Well done, indeed.
