  <Title>Overlord</Title>
  <Description>The honorable Warp-Scryer has told me of your perils, $n - and of the new foe you've discovered. If Kryv is to be believed, this 'Arazzius the Cruel' is as powerful and evil as any foe the Sons of Lothar have ever faced. $B$BWill you stand for us now, $n? Will you face this Legionlord and deliver the Light's justice upon him? If so, you will find him at the Pools of Aggonar. If not, his evil will most certainly find you. 
</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Arazzius the Cruel in the Pools of Aggonar and return to Force Commander Danath Trollbane in the keep of Honor Hold.
</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Tell me, $N, has the deed been done? Has the Legionlord been vanquished? 
</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Light be praised, I knew you'd do it! Arazzius and his minions are no more! Soon, we'll have the Legion running for home and this battered world will be safe once more. Then, when justice has been met, we can return home as well. $B$BThank you, $n - the Alliance and the Sons of Lothar honor you this day!
