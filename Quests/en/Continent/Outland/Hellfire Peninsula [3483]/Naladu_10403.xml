  <Title>Naladu</Title>
  <Description>Perhaps not all hope is lost for the Dreghood.  I am one of four elders that guided this tribe before we were enslaved by the Illidari.  I thought the others were dead, but I've slowly learned that at least two others are alive - chained down and powerless just as I am.$B$BI've not yet been able to find Naladu and fear for the worst.  There are more huts in the ruins upstairs; perhaps you could look for him.  It would be a great boon for our tribe if all our elders were alive.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Seek out Naladu inside the Ruins of Sha'naar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You've come to help my tribe, $r?  How unusual.  There aren't many that care about the fate of the Broken in this land.  </RewardText>
