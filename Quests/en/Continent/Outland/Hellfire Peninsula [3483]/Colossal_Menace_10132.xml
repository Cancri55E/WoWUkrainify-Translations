  <Title>Colossal Menace</Title>
  <Description>You see that huge red crystal to the north?  It fell from the sky not long ago, causing a massive earthquake.$B$BWhen we came out here to investigate the disturbance, we found all of these colossi wandering about that weren't previously here.$B$BThere's definitely something strange about that crystal and the energies that it's emanating, but I don't have time for that.  Those mountain giants are my immediate concern.$B$BI want you to head up to Fallen Sky Ridge and deal with them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 5 Raging Colossi and then return to Tola'thion at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You have eliminated the colossal menace?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good work.$B$BIf you ask me, all that we have to do is kill enough of those colossi, and then we won't have to worry any longer about the ridge or that strange crystal in the middle of it.$B$BHere, take one of these as a gift from the Cenarion Expedition.</RewardText>
