  <Title>When This Mine's a-Rockin'</Title>
  <Description>The mine's been overrun by a plague of gan'arg misfits, and on top of that, the peons have decided that this is a fine time for a nap! I don't know how they can sleep through all the disurbances coming from the mine, but that's the least of my problems.$B$BIf we don't get rid of those gan'arg pests soon, Thrallmar's supply of ore and other minerals will be cut off. I've already asked Watch Commander Krunk for help, but he says he can't spare the men with the town under constant attack. Will you help?</Description>
