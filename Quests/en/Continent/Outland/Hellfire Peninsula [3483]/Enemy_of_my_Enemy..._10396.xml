  <Title>Enemy of my Enemy...</Title>
  <Description>Now we focus on the second target - Forge Camp: Rage. It lies just west of Mageddon. Trouble is, the demons have a number of fel cannons aimed straight at the Horde's outpost of Thrallmar! Though I can scarcely believe it, we actually need the Horde to help us hold the line at the Dark Portal. We can't afford to let Thrallmar fall.  You've got to destroy these cannons before the Legion pulverizes our allies! </Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy 3 Fel Cannon MKIs in Forge Camp: Rage and return to Field Marshal Brock at Honor Point.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The Legion could start shelling the Horde at any time, $N! You need to destroy those blasted cannons! 
</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I have to hand it to you, $n, you're a fighter born! Those Horde yokels may never know how close they came to the end. It takes real character to step in harm's way on behalf of your enemies. That's the kind of honor and commitment that holds the Alliance together!  $B$B&lt;Field Marshal Brock salutes you crisply.&gt;
