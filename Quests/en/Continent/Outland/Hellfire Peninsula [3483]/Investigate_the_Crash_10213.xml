  <Title>Investigate the Crash</Title>
  <Description>When I was wounded in the wastes I saw a goblin zeppelin crash.  It went down to the northwest, beyond the Expedition Armory. $B$BThe zeppelin was on fire.  Shrieking, burning goblins were falling like bombs from the sky.  Of course I was in a lot of pain and I had lost a lot of blood.  I may have imagined the whole thing.$B$BIf you can find any survivors, we can offer them sanctuary here at Spinebreaker Post.  </Description>
  <LogDescription>Search for crash survivors.  </LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We were shot down by the Burning Legion, even though we waved a flag of truce.  Who knew the Burning Legion was so mean? $B$BWe cannot come with you to Spinebreaker Post.  We need to repair our zeppelin and be on our way.  </RewardText>
