  <Title>The Battle Horn</Title>
  <Description>Perhaps we have taken the wrong approach to the Unyielding? $B$BThe tome tells me the Expedition Armory was destroyed by orcs and death knights long ago.  The Unyielding remain here as vengeful spirits trapped in an eternal battle against the fel orc clans.  $B$BThey think only of revenge.  We must arrange for them to defeat their most hated enemies.  Enter the Expedition Armory once again and find Lieutenant Commander Thalvos.  He carries a battle horn that can summon the Unyielding.  Bring it to me.  </Description>
  <LogDescription>Take the Unyielding Battle Horn from Lieutenant Commander Thalvos and bring it to Althen the Historian in Spinebreaker Post.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We must help the Unyielding soon.  If we can convince them to join us the Horde will have gained a powerful ally.  </CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You have done well $N.  This ancient horn will allow us to summon the Unyielding. $B$BThat is, if they are willing.  </RewardText>
