  <Title>Outland Sucks!</Title>
  <Description>I can't believe I left Booty Bay to come to Outland.  My cousin Screed Luckheed promised me I would make a fortune, but instead he flew off in his zeppelin and left me here to try to scrape a living out of this mine.  $B$BHow am I suppose to make a living here with helboars and demons and fel orcs attacking all the time?  My shredder here was broken yesterday and the parts I need to fix it were stolen by fel orcs.  They took the parts into the fissure to the southwest and may have dropped them there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find 6 Shredder Parts and return to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find some spare parts for my shredder?  I really want to get it fixed so I can get back to mining.  I have to make a living somehow, if only so I can buy a one-way ticket back to Booty Bay.  </CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hurray, you found some parts!  Now maybe I can get my shredder working.  If I earn enough money I might be able to get back to Booty Bay. $B$BI sure hope my cousin, Screed Luckheed, crashes that stupid zeppelin of his.  I can't believe he tricked me into coming to Outland.</RewardText>
