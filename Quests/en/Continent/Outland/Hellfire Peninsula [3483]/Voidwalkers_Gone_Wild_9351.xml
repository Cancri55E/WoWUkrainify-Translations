  <Title>Voidwalkers Gone Wild</Title>
  <Description>Even if I can get the zeppelin's frame repaired, I'll have to find something else to power the engine. I'm all out of fuel and there's no place to fill up around here!$B$BTo the south of us is an area of broken land called the Warp Fields. It's full of rogue and uncontrolled voidwalkers, but I like to think of them as walking batteries.$B$BIf you can bring me enough of their essence, I can convert the zeppelin's engine to run on it. Five gold says I'll even get better mileage out of it, too!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 10 Condensed Voidwalker Essences to "Screaming" Screed Luckheed at the Zeppelin Crash.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to get the essence?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is perfect! In fact, I think it's going to work so well, I might just have to redesign the engine to take advantage of all this extra power. If, I mean, when we get out of here, I'll have to show my design to everyone back at Area 52!</RewardText>
