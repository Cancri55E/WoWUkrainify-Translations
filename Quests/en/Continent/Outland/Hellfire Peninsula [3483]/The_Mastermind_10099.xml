  <Title>The Mastermind</Title>
  <Description>Those infernal gan'arg keep scurrying into the mine! For each one you kill, two or three more seem to take its place!$B$BThere's got to be someone down there in the deepest reaches of the mine directing the incursion. You seemed to do well against them last time, and Light knows you're the only one brave enough to venture back into the mine. Find out who's responsible for this disturbance and make him pay!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate and kill Z'kral in the mines beneath Honor Hold, then report back to Foreman Biggums.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I'm almost afraid to ask. Seeing you come out of the mine alive means one of two things: either you killed the bastard, or you lost your nerve. Well, which is it?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I'm glad you managed to take care of, of... what did you say he called himself? Z'kral?$B$BFrom your description, it sounds more like an 'it' than a 'him' but all that matters is it's dead.</RewardText>
