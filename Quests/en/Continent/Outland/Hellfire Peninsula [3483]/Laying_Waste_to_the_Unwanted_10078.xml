  <Title>Laying Waste to the Unwanted</Title>
  <Description>Now that we've gotten our salvage operation off the ground, it's time to begin the second phase of the plan.$B$BAcross the Path of Glory, the Horde still has their old blade throwers trained on us. Don't let their age fool you, $n, they're still very dangerous. Much as we're working to reclaim what we can, we can't assume the Horde is going to dismantle their weaponry.$B$BTake this torch and burn the remaining siege equipment. I'll take no chances with Honor Hold's safety.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Flaming Torch to burn the Horde Blade Throwers overlooking the Path of Glory.  Then, bring the Flaming Torch to Dumphry in Honor Hold.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You seem to be in good spirits. Has burning Horde siege machinery put the spring back in your step?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That's the spirit!$B$BI'm glad we finally got some reinforcements, but I'm not so sure about their attitude toward the Horde. Where I come from, anyone with a weapon pointed at you is an enemy and needs to be dealt with like one!</RewardText>
