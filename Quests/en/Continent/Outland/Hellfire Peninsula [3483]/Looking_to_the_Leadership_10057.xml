  <Title>Looking to the Leadership</Title>
  <Description>The disturbances at Expedition Armory continue, despite your best efforts. No one truly knows everything that happened there, nor exactly what binds the spirits of the fallen soldiers to the ruins.$B$BPerhaps we've been approaching this the wrong way. I've always assumed that each of the ghosts had a tie to the ruins, but what if their ties were to their leaders?$B$BArch Mage Xintor and Lieutenant Commander Thalvos were particularly close to their men, so perhaps overcoming their ghosts will calm the rest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Overcome the ghosts of Arch Mage Xintor and Lieutenant Commander Thalvos and return to Honor Guard Wesilow in the tower northwest of Honor Hold.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to overcome the officers at the ruins?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We can only hope that with the quieting of the ghosts of the officers, the spirits of the foot soldiers will follow. Thank you once again for your help, $n.</RewardText>
