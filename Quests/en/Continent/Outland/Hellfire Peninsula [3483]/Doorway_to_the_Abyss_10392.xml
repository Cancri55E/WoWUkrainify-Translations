  <Title>Doorway to the Abyss</Title>
  <Description>You are an honor to us, $n. But now we must strike before the Legion recovers! To the north of Thrallmar lies Invasion Point: Annihilator. It houses a warp-portal through which the Legion draws its reinforcements. $B$BYou must overload that portal - and blast it back to the abyss it came from. The portal's activation key will be held by the Point's commander - Warbringer Arix'Amal. Slay him. Take the key. Use it on the portal and do what must be done. May the warchief's blessings be with you.   </Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Arix'Amal to get the Burning Legion Gate Key.  Use the Burning Legion Gate Key on the Rune of Spite, then return to Nazgrel in Thrallmar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hurry, $N. Every second that warp-portal stands open, another foul demon is brought into this world! 
</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Praise the ancients, you've done it, $N! The Legion has suffered a terrible defeat - and Thrallmar is safe once again. Ah, if I had but a hundred warriors with your heart and cunning, this broken land would be tamed already! I salute you. $B$B&lt;Nazgrel salutes you crisply&gt;</RewardText>
