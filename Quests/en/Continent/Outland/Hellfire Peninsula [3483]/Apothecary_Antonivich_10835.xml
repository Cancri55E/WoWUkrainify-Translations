  <Title>Apothecary Antonivich</Title>
  <Description>$n, I have prepared a preliminary report of my findings regarding the Bleeding Hollow orcs.  My colleague in Thrallmar, Apothecary Antonivich, will be happy to receive them.  He too studies the phenomenon of fel orcs... in hopes of preventing such a tragedy from again befalling our orcish allies.$B$BTake him this report, and I will continue my study of the blood you brought me.  If fortune is with us, we will isolate the cause of the fel orc affliction.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Albreck's Findings to Apothecary Antonivich at Thrallmar in Hellfire Peninsula.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Good day, $n.  And how is your stay in Hellfire Peninsula?  I trust it has been fruitful...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah, a report from Albreck? Very good. The Royal Apothecary Society works feverishly to determine how the orcs of Hellfire Peninsula became fel orcs. Their betrayal is unforgivable... and we must ensure that our orc friends are forever safe from future corruption.</RewardText>
