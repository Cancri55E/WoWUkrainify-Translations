  <Title>Helboar, the Other White Meat</Title>
  <Description>Those eggs are superb, but what do you say we kick it up another notch?$B$BA side of bacon would round out the meal perfectly and I know just where to get it.$B$BThis place is littered with helboars. Of course, there's no one here to inspect and tenderize the meat, but we're in luck!$B$B&lt;Legassi rummages around in his pack and produces a flask.&gt;$B$BThis wasn't made for use on pork, but cooking is as much about improvisation as anything else!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Legassi at the Zeppelin Crash wants you to gather 8 Purified Helboar Meat. To purify the meat, use the Purification Mixture on the Tainted Helboar Meat you gather from Helboars.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you successful in purifying the helboar meat?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hmm...$B$BThis looks edible, if spiced properly. Just don't tell Screed where his breakfast came from, ok?</RewardText>
