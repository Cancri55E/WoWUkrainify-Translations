  <Title>The Longbeards</Title>
  <Description>We were having a problem with arakkoa bandits raiding many of our supply caravans, so I hired some dwarves to take care of them.$B$BThey were brothers; Gremni Longbeard was the oldest.$B$BI'm a little worried about them.  Those crazy dwarves packed more ale than food or ammunition!  Maybe you can go check up on them?$B$BThe arakkoa's hideout, the Den of Haal'esh, can be found to the far west of here - beyond the Great Fissure.  They set up camp northwest of there, south of Dustquill Ravine.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Look for Gremni Longbeard northwest of the Den of Haal'esh, to the far west of Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula.</LogDescription>
