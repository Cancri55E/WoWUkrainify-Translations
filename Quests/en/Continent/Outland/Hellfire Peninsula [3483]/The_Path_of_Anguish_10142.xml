  <Title>The Path of Anguish</Title>
  <Description>Doom Lord Kazzak commands the Burning Legion in Outland. While we can't get to Kazzak - yet - we can and must get to his lieutenants that command Legion troops from the ground.$B$BThey have stationed dreadlords at the Path of Anguish, east of here. They are the ones responsible for these infernal storms that rain down upon our heads. To take them and their minions out would be a great set back to the Burning Legion.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Sergeant Altumus at the East Supply Caravan east of Honor Hold in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to kill 4 Flamewaker Imps, 6 Infernal Warbringers and 1 Dreadcaller.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Honor Hold is safe so long as the archers guard our skies.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Outstanding work, soldier. The frequency of the attacks is sure to lessen - at least until they bring forth new dreadlords.$B$BNow for the bad news: I've got your new orders...</RewardText>
