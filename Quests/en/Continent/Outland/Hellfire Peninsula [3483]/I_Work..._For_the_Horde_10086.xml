  <Title>I Work... For the Horde!</Title>
  <Description>Would you believe it?  These orcs hired me to help them shore up damaged fortifications and build explosives.  What a dream job!  It's too bad we're so short on materials, but a clever goblin like myself learns how to make do!$B$BCan you help me?  I need salvaged wood and metal from the ruined battlements along the Path of Glory.  Go down there and salvage, and watch out for those red-skinned orcs!$B$BWhen you're done, come back for big rewards!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 8 pieces of Salvaged Metal and 8 pieces of Salvaged Wood to Megzeg Nukklebust in Thrallmar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>So how did the salvage mission go?  Did you find anything useful?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This stuff is great! A little bent and a little burnt, but I've never let low grade materials stop me from making precision high explosives.$B$BThanks, $N. You really have an eye for quality trash!</RewardText>
