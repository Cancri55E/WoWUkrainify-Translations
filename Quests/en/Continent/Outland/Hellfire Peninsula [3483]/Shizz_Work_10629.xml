  <Title>Shizz Work</Title>
  <Description>I finally got my shredder working but I seem to have lost the keys.  I keep a pack of felhounds to protect my camp.  They don't do a very good job and they like to bite me a lot.  They also like shiny things.  I think this one felhound I have may have eaten my shredder keys.  I'll pay you if you'll take my felhound on a walk.  Kill some helboars and let him eat.  He'll do his business.  When he's done, see if you can't find the keys in his "leavings."</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Felhound Whistle to summon a Fel Guard Hound.  Take the Fel Guard Hound for a walk and kill some Deranged Helboars.  Search for the Shredder Keys in the Fel Guard Hound's "leavings."  Return the Shredder Keys to Foreman Razelcraz by the mine northwest of Thrallmar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you manage to find my keys?  I'm sure one of my felhounds ate them.  It's probably the one I sent with you.  Probably.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You smell terrible.  But you found my keys!  Thank you so much.  Now I can get my shredder started and make some money.  Pretty soon I will have enough money to leave Outland.  I don't know why you stay; I hate this place.  Wouldn't you rather be back in Booty Bay?  $B$BMaybe do some fishing?</RewardText>
