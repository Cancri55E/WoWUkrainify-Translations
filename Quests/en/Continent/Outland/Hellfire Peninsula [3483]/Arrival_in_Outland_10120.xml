  <Title>Arrival in Outland</Title>
  <Description>Aided by the Alliance, my forces will hold the line here, but I need you to deliver my report to General Krakork in Thrallmar. With his help, we'll be able to drive these demons back into the abyss that spawned them! Speak to Vlagga Freyfeather. She'll speed you on your way.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Lieutenant General Orion at the Dark Portal in Hellfire Peninsula wants you to bring Orion's Report to Vlagga Freyfeather.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I saw you speaking with Orion - it must be important business...</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>So you're Orion's new messenger? I pray you fare better than the last one he sent, $C. With the Legion pressing in, you'd never make it to Thrallmar on foot. Say the word, and my faithful wyvern will deliver you there safely.</RewardText>
