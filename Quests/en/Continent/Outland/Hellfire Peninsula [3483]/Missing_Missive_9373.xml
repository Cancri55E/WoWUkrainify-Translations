  <Title>Missing Missive</Title>
  <Description>Upon examining the battered leather case, it becomes apparent that the container's damage must've been caused by the caustic fluid of the worm's digestive tract. The leather appears to have been intricately tooled at one time, but the details of its adornment can no longer be made out.$B$BThe only recognizable feature of the case is a worn logo of the Cenarion Circle. Knowing nothing about the contents of the case, you decide the best course of action would be to deliver it to a Circle member.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return the Eroded Leather Case to Thiah Redmane, camped near the Ruins of Sha'naar in western Hellfire Peninsula.</LogDescription>
