He spent much of his time studying slimes, of all things!$B$BHe went missing in there a few days ago.  They say he's dead and there's nothing I can do about it.$B$BOne thing I can do is try to ensure that his research doesn't die with him.  Go northeast to the pools and look for his journal.  He always carried it inside a brown knapsack.</Description>
