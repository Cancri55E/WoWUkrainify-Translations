  <Title>Saving Scout Makha</Title>
  <Description>The tracks lead south from Makha's equipment, appearing to cross the Path of Glory. The roughness of the shallow ruts suggests that Makha's captors were in a hurry to move her to the next destination, but why?$B$BWas someone waiting there for her, perhaps Warboss Nekrogg, the leader named in the orders you found further north?$B$BThe shield and the tracks raise more questions than they solve, but it seems certain that where you find Scout Makha, you're likely to find Warboss Nekrogg too.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Continue south across the Path of Glory to the Southern Rampart and search for where Warboss Nekrogg is holding Scout Makha.</LogDescription>
