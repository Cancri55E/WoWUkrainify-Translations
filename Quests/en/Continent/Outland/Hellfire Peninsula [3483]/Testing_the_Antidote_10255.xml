  <Title>Testing the Antidote</Title>
  <Description>I think there's something we can use in the blood as the base of an antidote. Don't look at me like I've lost my mind!$B$BIt's a common theme in nature. Often, the cure for something can be derived from the toxin itself. That's just what I aim to do.$B$BRidding the boars of their demonic influence would probably eliminate their aggression and give us insight into how to best attempt to help other species.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Cenarion Antidote on a Hulking Helboar and observe the results. Once you have the results of the experiment, return to Thiah Redmane at the Cenarion Post in Hellfire Peninsula.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the results of the experiment?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Thiah Redmane's eyes widen as you describe the results of the experiment.&gt;$B$BBut, how could that happen? I'm certain I prepared the antidote correctly!$B$BI've seen it work with spider and snake venoms, so why would it backfire here? Perhaps that's one of Outland's many peculiarities, $n. I'd best pass this information along to my comrades.</RewardText>
