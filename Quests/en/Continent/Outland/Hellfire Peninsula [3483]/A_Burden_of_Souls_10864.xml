  <Title>A Burden of Souls</Title>
  <Description>I have a device, the Demoniac Scryer, that can analyze fel magic.  I would have you use the Scryer, but first... you must appease it.  The Scryer, you see, has trapped within it a creature of vast intelligence and its needs are, shall we say, quite eccentric.$B$BTo appease the Scryer, you must kill orcs.  Specifically, they must be Shattered Hand orcs -- the Scryer demands their souls.$B$BReturn to me when the souls are reaped.  You will find the orcs north, and south, and surrounding... Hellfire Citadel.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 20 Shattered Hand orcs, then return to Apothecary Antonivich in Thrallmar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The Demonaic Scryer is not yet appeased, $N. Return to me after you have reaped the souls of Shattered Hand orcs.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $N. Your soul is burdened with many deaths... and the Demonaic Scryer will now perform its duties for you.$B$BLet us hope you are ready for the coming trial...</RewardText>
