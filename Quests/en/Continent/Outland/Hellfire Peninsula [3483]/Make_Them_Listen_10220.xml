  <Title>Make Them Listen</Title>
  <Description>I was sent here to make contact with the Unyielding spirits.  These once proud Alliance soldiers were defeated long ago, and now their cursed spirits haunt the ruins to the west.  $B$BIf they would only join us we would gain a powerful ally.  Imagine, a legion of undying warriors to use against our enemies.  But these undead are mad with hatred and will not listen to me.  $B$BPerhaps they can be forced to join us.  </Description>
