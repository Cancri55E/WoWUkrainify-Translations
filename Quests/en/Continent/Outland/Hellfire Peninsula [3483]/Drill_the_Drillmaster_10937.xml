  <Title>Drill the Drillmaster</Title>
  <Description>I'm receiving reports that the Shattered Hand fel orcs, out in front of Hellfire Citadel, are organizing for what looks like an all-out assault.  No doubt, they're not happy about your successes against all of the clans.$B$BGet to the base of the citadel, where the Path of Glory ends.  You'll find the fel orcs busy with their preparations, but you're going to catch them with their pants down.$B$BEliminate the one that's in charge of that force.  Kill Drillmaster Zurok!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Force Commander Danath Trollbane has ordered you to kill Drillmaster Zurok with all due haste.  Return to the force commander at Honor Hold in the Hellfire Peninsula once the drillmaster is dead.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is the drillmaster dead? Hmm, maybe my scouts are wrong?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I wasn't going to believe it until I heard it from you, personally.  Already our scouts are trickling in with information that the Shattered Hand are in disarray without their precious drillmaster to tell them what to do.$B$BYou've traveled a long road, $n.  I trust that you will accept this armor along with my thanks.  Wear it proudly, you've earned it!</RewardText>
