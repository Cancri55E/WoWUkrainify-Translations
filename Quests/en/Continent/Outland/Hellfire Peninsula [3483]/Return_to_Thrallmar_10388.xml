  <Title>Return to Thrallmar</Title>
  <Description>Hope you enjoyed your flight, friend. A messenger arrived while you were away - seems Nazgrel's got a new use for you. You'd best head back to Thrallmar and check in with him. I have a feeling the Legion's just getting warmed up.

  <LogDescription>Return to Thrallmar and speak with Nazgrel.

  <RewardText>Ah, $N, you've come just in time. Our scouts have discovered that the Legion positions on the ridge behind us are actually 'forge camps'. It's there that the demons are constructing their infernal fel reavers. If we move against them quickly we can disrupt their production!</RewardText>
