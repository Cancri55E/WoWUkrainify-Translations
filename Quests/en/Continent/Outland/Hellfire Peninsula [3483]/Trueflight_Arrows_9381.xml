  <Title>Trueflight Arrows</Title>
  <Description>With the influx of pilgrims and the encroachment of Alliance forces, things around Falcon Watch have gotten quite busy lately. In my spare time, I usually help prepare batches of arrows for the rangers, but I haven't had the chance to gather feathers for the fletching in a long time.$B$BI could offer you a bit of coin if you'd be willing to gather the tail feathers of the bonestripper vultures. In the past, I've found them circling the bones of large beasts to the north of Falcon Watch.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 8 Bonestripper Tail Feathers from Bonestripper Vultures and bring them to Falconer Drenna Riverwind at Falcon Watch.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to get all the feathers?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These should do the job. I was concerned that the rangers might be short on arrows for a while, but that's one less thing I have to worry about. Thank you for your help, $C.</RewardText>
