  <Title>More Arakkoa Feathers</Title>
  <Description>I've had some success drawing the arakkoa spirits closer to me, but they are still very shy. Perhaps if I improve my disguise, they will be more willing to approach me in the trance.$B$BTo do that, though, I'll need more feathers like the ones you've already brought me. If you get any more of the feathers, I'd be very happy to take them off your hands.</Description>
