  <Title>Magical Disturbances</Title>
  <Description>It's embarrassing to admit this, but something has happened to me here in Terokkar Forest that hasn't occurred since my apprentice days.$B$BOccasionally, my spells will fizzle when I know I've done everything correctly. I almost drove myself crazy the first time it happened.$B$BI think I've found the cause. The forest is full of creatures called warp stalkers, demonic creatures with an affinity for magic and a habit of disturbing magical flows. The best way to deal with them is simply to kill them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold wants you to kill 10 Warp Stalkers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you cleared the warp stalkers from the vicinity of the stronghold?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Andarl dabs at his forehead with the sleeve of his robe.&gt;$B$BThank goodness. I was beginning to wonder if the things had displaced the rest of the forest's creatures.</RewardText>
