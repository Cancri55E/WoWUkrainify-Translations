  <Title>Magical Disturbances</Title>
  <Description>There's nothing more annoying than preparing to cast a spell, only to have it interrupted by some unseen force. After the fourth time, I knew it couldn't be coincidence and I sent Keb'ezil out to investigate.$B$BI guarantee you'll never encounter an imp that talks back more than Keb.$B$BAnyway, he managed to find the source of the problem, a pesky creature known as a warp stalker. They have a habit of disturbing the magical energy wherever they blink into existence. I've had enough of their interference.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Warp Stalkers and return to Kurgatok at Stonebreaker Hold.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Keb'ezil wants to know if it's safe to hurl a fireball without embarrassing himself again.$B$B&lt;The imp makes a few clicking sounds and the warlock turns toward him.&gt;$B$BNo, it wasn't my shadow bolt! Take it back, you overgrown pixy!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Keb'ezil is relieved that you've taken care of that little problem, aren't you, Keb?$B$B&lt;The imp ignores its master, presumably out of indignation.&gt;$B$BYou'll have to forgive his bad manners. You know how demons can be...</RewardText>
