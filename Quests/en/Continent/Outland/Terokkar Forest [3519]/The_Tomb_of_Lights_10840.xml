  <Title>The Tomb of Lights</Title>
  <Description>To the east, buried under the charred sand, is the Tomb of Lights, a lost resting place of the dead.  Before our caravan was ambushed I was going to journey to the tomb and cleanse it of evil spirits.  $B$BLittle did I know it was already infested with another kind of evil.  Even now the ethereals plunder the bodies of the fallen for trinkets and keepsakes that were given to the dead centuries ago.  $B$BThere is little I can do while our caravan struggles to survive.  </Description>
  <LogDescription>High Priest Orglum wants you to journey to the Tomb of Lights and kill 10 Ethereal Nethermancers and 10 Ethereal Plunderers and then return to him at the Refugee Caravan.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How many ethereals have you destroyed? I hope it will be enough to drive them from the Tomb of Lights.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Out here in the wilds of Outland we are weak with few heroes to defend our rights, but you have given them something to fear $c.  I do not think the ethereals will soon forget the strong right arm of $n. </RewardText>
