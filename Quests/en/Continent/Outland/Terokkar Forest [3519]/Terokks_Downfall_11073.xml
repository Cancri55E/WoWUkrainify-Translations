  <Title>Terokk's Downfall</Title>
  <Description>I... I've turned a blind eye to your dealings with the arakkoa prisoner, $n.  It looks like your instincts to cooperate with him were right.$B$BYou must understand... I would've faced a mutiny in my current state if I endorsed your efforts to bring Terokk to this world.$B$BTake the items that Hazzik prepared for you and go ahead with your plan.  I will command my men to back you up when the time comes.  I recommend that you bring a force of your own as well.  I fear you'll only get one chance at this.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take the Time-Lost Offering prepared by Hazzik to the Skull Pile at the center of Skettis and summon and defeat Terokk.  Return to Sky Commander Adaris when you've completed this task.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is it done, $N? Has Terokk been defeated?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You've made us all very proud, $N.  I'll send word of your deeds back to Shattrath.  The Skyguard will be forever in your debt.</RewardText>
