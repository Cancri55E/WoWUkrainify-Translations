  <Title>A Dandy's Best Friend</Title>
  <Description>Don't let Thander and company fool you. They may look like a band of fearsome warriors, but underneath all that steel, they're nothing more than a troop of dandies!$B$BAnd they won't be seen in public without their hats. They're extravagant affairs made from felt and fur, complete with the gaudiest feathers you've ever seen.$B$BThe most desirable feathers come from any of the arakkoa, of course, and my supply is running low. I'll gladly pay you if you'll collect them for me.</Description>
