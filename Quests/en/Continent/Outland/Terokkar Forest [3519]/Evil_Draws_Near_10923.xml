  <Description>Now you must use the Dread Relic in a foul necromantic ritual if you wish to challenge Teribus the Cursed.  To the northeast, beyond Auchindoun, is the Writhing Mound, a place where necromancers gather.  $B$BThe auchenai death-speakers and doomsayers carry doom skulls that are laced with powerful necro-enchantments.  If you collect enough skulls you can use their power along with the power of the Dread Relic to command Teribus to face you.</Description>
