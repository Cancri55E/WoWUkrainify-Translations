  <Title>Strange Energy</Title>
  <Description>Something strange has changed the teromoths of the thicket.$B$BWhere once there was a diversity of life in there, now only the teromoths remain.  And while before they were at peace, now they are agitated and will not hesitate to attack you should you get close.$B$BI need to compare the vicious ones to the normal.  Collect for me a number of samples from both.  You'll find the unaffected teromoths both to the south and the north.$B$BI'm certain this is related to whatever killed all of the druids.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 4 Teromoth Samples and 4 Vicious Teromoth Samples.  Then return to Earthbinder Tavgren just outside of the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have my samples?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Odd.  The samples from the vicious teromoths are infused with what feels to me to be pure mana.$B$BIt would seem that whatever caused all of this death also left behind that strong field of residual energy.  But for some reason the teromoths were not killed by it; instead being driven into an agitated state.$B$BIt seems apparent that this strange energy is the by-product of whatever attacked the thicket.</RewardText>
