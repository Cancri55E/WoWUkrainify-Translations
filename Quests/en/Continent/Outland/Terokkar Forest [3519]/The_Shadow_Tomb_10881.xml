  <Title>The Shadow Tomb</Title>
  <Description>Many believe it was the Shadow Council that caused the explosion that tore Auchindoun apart.  It is rumored they awoke a great evil inside.$B$BIf that is true, then that evil must have turned against them.  According to these orders, part of the Shadow Council is fleeing Auchindoun.  They are using the Shadow Tomb to store powerful artifacts from Auchindoun.$B$BThree of these are sacred, for they belonged to the powerful patriarchs Arunen, K'alen and Atalor.  I must ask you to retrieve them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Go into the Shadow Tomb, west of the Refugee Caravan and retrieve the Drape of Arunen, the Gavel of K'alen and the Scroll of Atalor.  Return to Mekeda at the Refugee Caravan after you've completed this task.</LogDescription>
