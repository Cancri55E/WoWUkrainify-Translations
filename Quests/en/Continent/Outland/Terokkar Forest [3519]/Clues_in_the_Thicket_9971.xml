  <Title>Clues in the Thicket</Title>
  <Description>I have no idea what killed all of the druids here.  I've been away for a couple of days on a survey of the Bone Wastes to the south.$B$BPlease, you must help me to uncover what's behind this horrible tragedy.  Go into the thicket and look for a clue that might reveal something to us.  When I was in there briefly, I could have sworn I saw a dead Broken and a strange object next to him.$B$B And don't worry about Treelos - he might have been driven insane by what happened, but I think he's mostly harmless.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Investigate the Strange Object next to the Broken Corpse to determine what might have befallen the Cenarion Thicket.  Then return to Earthbinder Tavgren just outside the thicket in Terokkar Forest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you discovered anything yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>So, I was right.  That was the corpse of one of the Broken?  And you can confirm that there was a strange object on the ground next to him?$B$BThis doesn't make any sense.  What would one of the Broken be doing here?  And what is that thing it had with him?$B$BIs it what caused all of this death?</RewardText>
