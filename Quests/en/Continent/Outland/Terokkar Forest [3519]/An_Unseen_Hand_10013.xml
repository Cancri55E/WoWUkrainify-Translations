  <Title>An Unseen Hand</Title>
  <Description>The writing on the plans is far too delicate and precise to have come from any of the fel orcs. You can't make out what the text says, but the implications are pretty clear: the fel orcs are taking orders from the blood elves at Firewing Point.$B$BWhy would the two forces be working together? Rokag might have some insight into this odd alliance. You decide to make your way back to Stonebreaker Hold and show him the map.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Fel Orc Plans to Rokag at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar Forest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What is it you have there, $N?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Rokag takes the plans from you and looks them over.&gt;$B$BSo Kaide was right! Those fel orc scum are up to something. I never would've guessed they were colluding with the blood elves, though.$B$BAccording to this map, the fel orcs are to keep us busy... but why? This is disturbing news, $N. You were correct in bringing it to me right away.</RewardText>
