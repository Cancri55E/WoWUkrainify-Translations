  <Title>Who Are They?</Title>
  <Description>I don't know who they are, but I know they're hostile!$B$BI'm going to give you a disguise, and I want you to go in there and speak with three of them that I've observed as being 'chatty'. Talk with the initiate, the laborer, and the advisor.$B$BJust watch out; there're a few hunters in there who'll be able to see through your disguise and they look tough! And whatever you do, don't leave the village -- the disguise is kind of flimsy. If you lose your disguise, come back to me and I'll give you another.</Description>
  <LogDescription>While in disguise, speak with the Shadowy Initiate, the Shadowy Laborer and the Shadowy Advisor.  Then return to Scout Neftis at Grangol'var Village in Terokkar Forest.</LogDescription>
