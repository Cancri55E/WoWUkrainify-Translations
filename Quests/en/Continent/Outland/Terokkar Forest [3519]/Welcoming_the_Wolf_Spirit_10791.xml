  <Title>Welcoming the Wolf Spirit</Title>
  <Description>I've nearly completed the vestments that I'll wear during the ceremony. As I add the finishing touches, I'd like you to set this incense by the candles near the runestone to my left.$B$BI believe it will help us to attract the wolf spirit's attention, since it was made in the days of the orcish clans. I can almost imagine my ancestors using it in a ceremony paying tribute to the wolf spirit after a successful hunt.$B$BOnce you've placed the incense, I'll begin the ceremony.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Ceremonial Incense near the candles in Malukaz's hut and observe the ceremony. When the ceremony is complete, speak with Malukaz again.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Reestablishing ties with the wolf spirit is just the beginning of my journey, not the end.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This is incredible! I set out on this journey unsure of whether the wolf spirit would answer our summons and now it feels as though he's always been here. Perhaps he was, $N.$B$BPerhaps he was waiting for the orcs to realize what their choices had wrought.</RewardText>
