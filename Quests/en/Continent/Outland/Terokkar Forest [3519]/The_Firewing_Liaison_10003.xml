  <Title>The Firewing Liaison</Title>
  <Description>Over the past couple of days, I've observed a blood elf woman traveling to and from the fel orc stronghold and conversing with the fel orc leader. From her body language, she's clearly issuing orders. But why? Whose orders is she conveying?$B$BMy curiosity got the better of my judgment and I shadowed her when she left the fel orc encampment. She headed north, to Firewing Point. I stopped before reaching the perimeter of the blood elf outpost.$B$BKill her before she leaves the fel orc camp again.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate and slay Lisaile Fireweaver, then return to Shadowstalker Kaide.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The longer we permit them to make preparations, the more difficult it will be to root them out. Have you killed the liaison?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Kaide nods at you.&gt;$B$BWell done. We have bought ourselves a little time. The blood elves will grow curious about what happened to their friend. Hopefully, by that time, we will have a better understanding of their intentions.$B$BWhen the time is right, I will inform Rogak of our progress.</RewardText>
