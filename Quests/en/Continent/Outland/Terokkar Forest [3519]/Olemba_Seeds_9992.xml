  <Title>Olemba Seeds</Title>
  <Description>Aren't the trees in the forest beautiful? I've often wondered if they would survive on Azeroth.$B$BI'm hesitant to send back seedlings, though. It's a rough trip and they're much harder to transport than something like a sack of seeds. The seeds are stored in tough cones that fall from the tree's branches once they've reached maturity.$B$BIf you come upon some of those cones in your travels, would you mind bringing some of the seeds back to me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 30 Olemba Seeds and return them to Ros'eleth in the Allerian Stronghold.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I've started a seed collection, but I'm going to need some help before I have enough to send back to the park in Stormwind.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you for bringing these seeds. I've almost got enough to send back the first batch!</RewardText>
