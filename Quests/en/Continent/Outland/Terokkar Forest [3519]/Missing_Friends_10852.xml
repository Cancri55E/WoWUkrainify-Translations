  <Title>Missing Friends</Title>
  <Description>We broke down here because some guys came in the night and made a lot of noise.  It was scary.  I don't know when we are going to get moving again.  $B$BSome of my friends are missing though.  I don't know where they are.  I think those scary bird men took them away to the northwest.  They probably are all locked up in cages and stuff.  If you find them that would be great.  I'm kind of worried about them.</Description>
