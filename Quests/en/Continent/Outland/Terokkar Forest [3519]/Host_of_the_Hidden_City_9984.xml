  <Title>Host of the Hidden City</Title>
  <Description>Although you cannot read the strange script on the scroll, the ornate seal at the bottom of the document implies that it was drafted by an arakkoa of high standing. Luanga may have masterminded the capture and interrogation of Deirom, but it seems he was taking orders from someone else.$B$BYou remember Thander mentioning that Andarl has studied the arakkoa. Perhaps he can decipher the scroll's contents.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take Luanga's Orders to Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I can read most of this, enough to get a general idea. Whoever wrote this is praising the 'progress' made by Luanga and encouraging him to continue interrogating his 'guests.'$b$bMeanwhile, it says, 'the preparations in Skettis are proceeding as planned' and that they will 'soon be ready to reclaim their ancestral lands.'$b$bI'm not familiar with this 'Skettis' mentioned by the writer, but wherever it is, it sounds like the arakkoa are assembling an army there! Thander must be told about this immediately.</RewardText>
