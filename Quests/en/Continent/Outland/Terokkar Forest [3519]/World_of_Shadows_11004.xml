  <Title>World of Shadows</Title>
  <Description>Sky Commander Adaris was seriously injured during a Skettis incursion.  He's been in and out of consciousness since.$B$BI fear he has succumbed to a feverish delirium.  During brief lucid moments he demands that I prepare an elixir made from shadow dust carried by the arakkoa.  He seems to believe it will allow him to see into a "world of shadows" where the arakkoa's true leaders dwell.$B$BI do not believe this nonsense for a second, but I fear he won't rest until I obtain such an elixir.  Will you help?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Severin wants you to venture into Skettis and retrieve 6 Shadow Dusts from the arakkoa that dwell there.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you obtained the dust, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I thank you, $n.  I will administer a small amount to the commander... to humor him.  You can keep the rest, perhaps you'll find a use for it.</RewardText>
