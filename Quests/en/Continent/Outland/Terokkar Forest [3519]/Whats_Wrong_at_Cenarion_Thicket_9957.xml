  <Title>What's Wrong at Cenarion Thicket?</Title>
  <Description>We haven't heard from the druids at the Cenarion Thicket of Terokkar Forest in quite some time.$B$B$n, I'd like for you to go down there and check in with them to see what's happening.  There are several ways to get there, but the fastest is to head south along the path, and then take the road that branches east from Shattrath City once you're in the forest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with one of the druids at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'm glad that the refuge sent you.  The druids of the thicket have been slain!  Only myself and one other have survived, and he's insane.$B$BI don't know what happened, but I intend to get to the bottom of it.  Whatever it was, it happened quickly and feels unnatural.$B$BWill you help me?</RewardText>
