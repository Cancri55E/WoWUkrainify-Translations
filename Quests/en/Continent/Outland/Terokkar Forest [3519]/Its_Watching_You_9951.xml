  <Title>It's Watching You!</Title>
  <Description>Quick, hide!  The eyes of Naphthal'ar are upon you... upon us all!$B$BI dare not go to the top of the tower to speak with it, but you... you look as if you might know the right words to say.  Just be careful, it doesn't like jokes and will not suffer fools easily.$B$BIf you can, convince it to come down for tea.  But, by all means, get it to stop staring at me!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Naphthal'ar and then return to Warden Treelos at the Cenarion Thicket in Terokkar Forest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We should never have invited them to dinner.  That much is certain!$B$BOr, at least, we should have insisted upon a couple of courses before the dessert that they brought.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It's for the best, really.  If it cannot civilly accept an invitation then it has no business attending.$B$B&lt;Warden Treelos looks momentarily confused.&gt;$B$BWho are you and what are you doing here?  You must get out of here quickly before it is too late!</RewardText>
