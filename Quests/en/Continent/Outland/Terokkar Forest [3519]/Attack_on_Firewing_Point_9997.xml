  <Title>Attack on Firewing Point</Title>
  <Description>We know that the blood elves of Firewing Point are working for Kael'thas and Illidan.  And from what you've told me, clearly they are using the Broken of Tuurem as smuggling go-betweens for the creation of some horrible weapon.$B$BWhatever they're up to out there, the most efficient thing that we can do right now is to thin out their numbers.$B$BThe Firewing blood elves need to be taken out!  Head over to Firewing Point to the northeast and see to it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Firewing Defenders, 10 Firewing Bloodwarders, and 10 Firewing Warlocks.  Then report back to Sergeant Chawni at Stonebreaker Camp in Terokkar Forest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Report. What news do you bring from Firewing Point?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That's a good start, but based on what you witnessed there in the courtyard, as well as intelligence that I've received, we have a far more pressing matter at hand!</RewardText>
