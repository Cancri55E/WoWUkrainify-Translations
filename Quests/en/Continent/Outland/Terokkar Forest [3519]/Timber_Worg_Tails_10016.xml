  <Title>Timber Worg Tails</Title>
  <Description>Have you come across the timber worgs in your travels? I've had the opportunity to observe them while mapping some of the northern reaches of the forest. I wouldn't recommend getting close to them unless you're prepared for combat.$B$BThey have no fear of us and won't hesitate to defend their territory.$B$BIt's fitting that such a creature would have a magnificent tail. I've been trying to collect enough of them to trim a new cloak, but the worgs have a habit of evading my snares. Will you help?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bertelm at the Allerian Stronghold wants you to bring him 12 Timber Worg Tails. The tails can come from either Timber Worgs or Timber Worg Alphas.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I see you've managed to survive the rigors of the forest. Have you brought any tails for my cloak?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah, well done, friend. These are finer than I thought they'd be. They'll make a fine cloak.$B$B&lt;Bertelm glances toward the inn.&gt;$B$BYes, a fine cloak it shall be.</RewardText>
