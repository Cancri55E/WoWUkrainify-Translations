  <Title>A Handful of Magic Dust</Title>
  <Description>I'm going to need dust, but not just any dust.$B$BThe royal teromoths that inhabit the forest nearby have a magical dust upon their wings, which they use to pacify those that hunt them.  I can make use of that property of the dust to assuage the resistance that I am feeling from the arakkoa eyes you retrieved.  This, in turn, will allow me to use them to find Deirom.$B$BI won't need much, perhaps half a dozen handfuls, or so.</Description>
