  <Title>Concerns About Tuurem</Title>
  <Description>The rumors from Tuurem are unsettling. Some say the town's ruins are overrun with crazed Broken and Lost Ones, while opportunistic artifact hunters steal draenei relics.$B$BIt's hard to know which are true and which aren't, but we have a responsibility to safeguard the ruins as best we can. Find Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest. He is something of a student of magical relics. More than anyone else, he's likely to know what's going on there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Andarl at the Allerian Stronghold in Terokkar Forest.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'm flattered that your Broken friend considers me a scholar of his people's relics, but to be honest, I haven't had much chance to study them since my arrival here. It was certainly my intent, but when I arrived, I found that there were other matters that required my attention.</RewardText>
