  <Title>An Unwelcome Presence</Title>
  <Description>Our forces at Thrallmar thought they had the fel orcs contained in the Hellfire Citadel area, but the recent arrivals at the ruins to the east say otherwise.$B$BWe can't permit them to gain a foothold here. Rokag has dispatched Shadowstalker Kaide to the ruins to keep an eye on them, but we have to do something to keep them from digging in.$B$BGo to the ruins, decimate their peons, and then look for Kaide in the trees to the north. He'll tell you where to go from there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 12 Warped Peons and then report to Shadowstalker Kaide.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I was about to send a message back to Rokag recommending an attack, but I see that won't be necessary.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Stopping the fel orcs is going to take more than merely harassing their workers, I'm afraid. I've made a discovery that's shed some light on the reason for their presence here and it's reinforced my belief that we must act quickly.</RewardText>
