  <Title>Anima Reclamation</Title>
  <Description>Our efforts here need a constant supply of troops, supplies, and anima. The last one is the hardest, for obvious reasons. But I've learned to be resourceful. 

Nearby there is a plentiful source of anima: the devourers that currently swarm the Sanctuary of Guidance. It's not as easy as beating it out of a soul, but it's just as effective, if you're strong enough. Are you?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Reclaim $1oa Devoured Anima from devourers at the Sanctuary of Guidance.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You can trust me with this anima. I will see it is turned against the Jailer and his forces.</RewardText>
