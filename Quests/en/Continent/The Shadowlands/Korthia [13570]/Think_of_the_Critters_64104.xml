  <Title>Think of the Critters</Title>
  <Description>The wildlife of Korthia have been through so much. Some of them can't seem to find enough to eat.

I've saved some extra food that we can share with them. 

But I'm worried that they might be too shy to trust us, and I don't blame them! 

Here. Take these treats and see if you can get close enough to them to feed them properly. Even small creatures are so important.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Approach and feed Hungry Gromits in Korthia.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You were able to feed some of them? Wonderful!

I'll start saving up more food for next time. I hope that one day we can help this place heal, too.</RewardText>
