  <Title>Bone Tools</Title>
  <Description>So the device we need to open this vault is stuck on a floating island, eh?

Not a problem.

I see plenty of sturdy creatures around here. Like I always say, no bone goes to waste!

Bring me a pile of their bones. I'll use them to craft hookshot points for us to use to grapple over there.</Description>

  <RewardText>Yes, this will do. Think I'll save one to show the other smiths back home.</RewardText>
