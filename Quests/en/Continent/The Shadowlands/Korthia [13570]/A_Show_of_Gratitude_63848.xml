  <Title>A Show of Gratitude</Title>
  <Description>Your presence here fulfils an ancient prophecy, Maw Walker. I am certain you and your allies will save us.

Perhaps I judged your broker friend too harshly. She did escort you to Korthia, after all. 

Please extend our thanks to Ve'nari, and let her know we are happy to answer her questions.

She... does seem to have quite a number of them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Ve'nari at Keeper's Respite in Korthia.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>A thank-you is polite.

A favor is better.</RewardText>
