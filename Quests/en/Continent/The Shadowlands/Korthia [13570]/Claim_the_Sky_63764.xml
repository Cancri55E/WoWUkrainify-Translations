  <Title>Claim the Sky</Title>
  <Description>I mourn the loss of my sisters and desire nothing more than to avenge them. Yet I know that I am no match for the witch's magics or her army of Mawsworn.

We must let wisdom guide us and fly from here. 

Though I am weak from my captivity, I have the strength to bear you from this place.

Let us go, friend.</Description>
