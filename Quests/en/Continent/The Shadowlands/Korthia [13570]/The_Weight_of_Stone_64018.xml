  <Title>The Weight of Stone</Title>
  <Description>The campaign continues, $p. The Stone Legion is here to turn the tide of battle.

First, we must deliver supplies to our allies. The broken land of Korthia means we are the only ones who can keep our troops supplied.

Second, we must deal with the mawsworn and the devourers. I have a very simple strategy. We are going to drop anima onto the mawsworn. That will attract the devourers to attack. Either they kill the mawsworn, or the mawsworn kills them. Regardless, we win.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Assist the Stone Legion in delivering supplies and anima.</LogDescription>
