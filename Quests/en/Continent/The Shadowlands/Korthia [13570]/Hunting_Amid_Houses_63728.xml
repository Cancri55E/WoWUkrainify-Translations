  <Description>I have dreamed that Tyrande Whisperwind is crucial to the survival of Ardenweald.

The night fae have been searching for others like her who were once Night Warriors. We have recruited an ancient ally of Azeroth, Huln Highmountain, in order to look for them.

Elune's power is too much for any mortal to contain--even Tyrande. I do not know how much longer she can hold on.

Allow me to explain further, then you must hurry to meet Huln in Maldraxxus.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Ysera to learn more, then find Huln Highmountain in the Sepulcher of Knowledge.</LogDescription>
