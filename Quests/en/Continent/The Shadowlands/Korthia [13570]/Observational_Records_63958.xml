  <Title>Observational Records</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, Maw Walker, a moment of your time?

As you no doubt know, my cartel has quietly spread observational devices all across Korthia. But that data is no good to us if it is not retrieved. Which is where you come in.

The records from outside the Vault should be ready to collect. You won't see the devices themselves, but the data will appear to you as a bright orb.

Bring those data to me, and I will reward you handsomely.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Observational Records from outside the Vault in Korthia.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The Vault is reason why the Jailer targeted Korthia with his chains. Many secrets of the Shadowlands are archived there.

If we can just get a glimpse of how it works and what it holds, that information would be most valuable indeed.

And here is your reward, as promised.</RewardText>
