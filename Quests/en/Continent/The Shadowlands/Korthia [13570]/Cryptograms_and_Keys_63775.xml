  <Title>Cryptograms and Keys</Title>
  <Description>The repositories of knowledge within Korthia have layers of security--for very good reasons.

Each vault requires cryptographs in order to decode and disable the barriers. They are, for lack of a better term, the keys to every secret.

Search outside the Vault for cryptographs stolen by the Mawsworn and return them to me. I will keep them, and the secrets they protect, safe.</Description>
