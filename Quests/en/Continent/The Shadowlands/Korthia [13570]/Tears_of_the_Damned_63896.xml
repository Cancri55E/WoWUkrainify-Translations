  <Title>Tears of the Damned</Title>
  <Description>To anchor the instrument to the Maw and make it capable of the effect you seek, it must be imbued with the raw, unfiltered agony endured by the souls trapped in this cursed prison. 

Sorrow is abundant here, and therefore simple to obtain. You need only travel to Gorgoa. The damned shed copious tears that fall as crystalized grief as they are swept along the River of Souls.

Be careful that their sadness does not overwhelm you.</Description>
