  <Title>Continued Efforts: Mauler's Outlook</Title>
  <Description>My Eyes tell me that the Mauler's Outlook is near the newly formed road from the Maw into Korthia. It would provide a strategic and tactical advantage.

Unfortunately, the area is overrun with shardhides.

If we can secure the area, it will provide us with a clear path to the west, as well as a point of observation to monitor the Jailer's forces.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Clear Mauler's Outlook of shardhides.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The tactical advantage we now hold is a huge win against the Jailer's Forces. Well done, $p.</RewardText>
