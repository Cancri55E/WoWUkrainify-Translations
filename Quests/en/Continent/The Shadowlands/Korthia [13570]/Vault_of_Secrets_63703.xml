  <Title>Vault of Secrets</Title>
  <Description>You've helped us regain a semblance of order, Maw Walker, but the outlook is dire.

The Jailer's forces have launched an all-out assault upon the ruins of our vault at the outer reaches of Korthia. Clearly the Banished One seeks something of value inside.

The vault's defenses activate when the structure is threatened, so getting inside won't be easy. But we must recover whatever the Jailer is seeking before his Mawsworn do.

I've enlisted the aid of a necrolord who can help open the vault.</Description>
