  <Description>It seems Tubbins and Gubbins have gone off somewhere.

I do worry about the two of them. Be a dear and check on them. One never knows what shenanigans they might be up to.

I last saw them speaking with one of the faeries from Ardenweald. They were discussing the fine art of tea making.</Description>
