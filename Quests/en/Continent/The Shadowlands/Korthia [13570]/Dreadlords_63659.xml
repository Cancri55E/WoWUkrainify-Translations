  <Title>Dreadlords!</Title>
  <Description>This is the fifth dreadlord I have found infiltrating our forces this week. Unchecked they can cause tremendous damage to our foothold here.

In life I learned how to identify these creatures from a demon hunter. It makes it far easier for me to locate them, but I cannot be in all places at once.

We must report these findings to the Primus.</Description>
