  <Title>Razorwing Talons</Title>
  <Description>These lands are not well known yet by my hunters, but we have discovered formidable beasts that reside here.

Among these are the Razorwing: vicious predators with terrible talons... and the temper of a vorkai.

&lt;Herne grins fiercely.&gt;

Bring me some of their talons to help teach our newest hunters about the kinds of beasts they will face.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Razorwing Talons.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>These talons are in excellent shape. And they look like they could take out an eye! &lt;Herne chuckles ironically.&gt;

I expect they will get a lot of attention from our Wild Hunt recruits.

Thank you, Maw Walker.</RewardText>
