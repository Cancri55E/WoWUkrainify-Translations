  <Title>The Meaning of Wrath</Title>
  <Description>I will gather my forces and dispense a portion to Korthia immediately. I will also see to it that they are provided the tools Baroness Vashj and Kael'thas were able to conjure so that we might further defend against nathrezim incursions.

Other duties require my attention before I can descend on Korthia. I must secure Dominance Keep against further infiltrators.

I suppose the Primus will want an update. You may tell him you were successful.</Description>
