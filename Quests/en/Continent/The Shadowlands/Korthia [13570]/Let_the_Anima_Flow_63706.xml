  <Title>Let the Anima Flow</Title>
  <Description>Tal-Galan briefed me on the situation and explained the vault's workings. As well as any scholarly type could, at least.

First we need to ensure the vault is getting power. They use underground conduits to feed it anima.

The attendant says that one of these conduits is tucked away in a cave in Scholar's Den.

You get me there and I'll find a way to fix it. Just watch my back while I figure out how these Korthian devices work.</Description>
