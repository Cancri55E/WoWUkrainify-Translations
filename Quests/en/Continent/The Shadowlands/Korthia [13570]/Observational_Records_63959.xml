  <Title>Observational Records</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, Maw Walker, a moment of your time?

As you no doubt know, my cartel has quietly spread observational devices all across Korthia. But that data is no good to us if it is not retrieved. Which is where you come in.

The Sanctuary of Guidance records should be ready to collect. You won't see the devices themselves, but the data will appear to you as a bright orb.

Bring those data to me, and I will reward you handsomely.</Description>
