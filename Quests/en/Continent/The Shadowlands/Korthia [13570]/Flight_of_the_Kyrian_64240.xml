  <Title>Flight of the Kyrian</Title>
  <Description>We've engaged in a heavy battle at the entrance to the Vault of Secrets! Our forces could use some reinforcement.

Please, guide my fellow Ascended to give support to our fighters there. 

The fighters on the ground can handle the clean-up, but they need shields and healing.

Good luck!</Description>
