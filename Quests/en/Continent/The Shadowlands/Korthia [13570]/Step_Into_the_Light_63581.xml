  <Title>Step Into the Light</Title>
  <Description>It is as I feared.

This fragment of Uther's soul was darkened by the mourneblade that slew him. His memories are shattered and twisted.

For Uther to move past his pain, to move past his grief, he must experience his past once again.

But he does not have to do this alone.

Using my soul mirror, we can aid Uther in walking through these memories. He can then come to terms with the emotions they contain. We must help him see past the distortions and understand the truths they hold.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Soul Mirror to aid Uther in reliving his past.</LogDescription>
