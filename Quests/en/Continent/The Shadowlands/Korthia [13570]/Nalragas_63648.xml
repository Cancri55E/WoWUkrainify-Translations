  <Title>Nal'ragas</Title>
  <Description>The Stonewright's medallion must not stay in the hands of the nathrezim. 

From what the Accuser explained of our mission, the medallion is required if we wish to forge a new sigil for the Venthyr. I have no doubt that is why Nal'ragas and her ilk executed their ambush now.

The medallions are not subtle magic, and their affect on this realm is easily tracked. I suggest we give chase and eliminate this Nal'ragas before she can be reinforced.</Description>
