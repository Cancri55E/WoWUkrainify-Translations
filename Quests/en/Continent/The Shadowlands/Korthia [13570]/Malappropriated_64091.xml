  <Title>Mal'appropriated</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The dreadlord catches your eye, wishing to speak. You glance at your companions. Moonberry urges you forward with a mischievous grin. You step as close as you dare.&gt;

Free me from this prison, mortal, and you will have my favor. I am aligned with powers greater than these pathetic puppets or their masters. They have no concept of the true forces at work. 

All I need are the sigils of binding which hold me. The rest I can... take care of.

Free me, and you will be granted untold power.</Description>
