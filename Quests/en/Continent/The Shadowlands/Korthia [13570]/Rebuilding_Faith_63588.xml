  <Description>The Forsworn are lost, $n.

They are like ghosts, haunting the Temple of Loyalty. Nowhere else to go. Leaderless, purposeless, abandoned.

We must show them that there is a path forward.

Let me accompany you into the temple. Allow me to talk to them, speak to their sensibilities. Perhaps we can convince them to give Adrestes's new path a chance.</Description>
