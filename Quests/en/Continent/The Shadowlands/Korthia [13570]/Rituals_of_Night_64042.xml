  <Description>Tyrande's time grows short, so we must act quickly. 

&lt;Ysera frowns in concern.&gt;

We had hoped to gather more Night Warriors, but we will have to proceed with who we have and hope it is enough.

&lt;Ysera shakes her head, then looks more resolute.&gt;

Before we can begin, we must finish preparations for the ritual. Please bring these last few items with you and meet us at the grove.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Assist with the preparations and ritual.</LogDescription>
