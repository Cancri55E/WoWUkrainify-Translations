  <Title>The Proper Procedures</Title>
  <Description>I came here to observe the actions of those from Revendreth. However I have been met with news that concerns me.

$p, the attendants tell me that they stored anima in canisters and that anima is being looted, by our own people. That's not how this should be done.

Can I entrust you to retrieve the anima, so I might see it returned to its proper place?</Description>

  <RewardText>There's so much anima here. This will be very useful in helping the attendants rebuild. Thank you.</RewardText>
