  <Title>Sealed Secrets</Title>
  <Description>Ah, Korthia. What secrets will be revealed?

My associates have been hard at work, seeking to discover and procure various small items of interest throughout this broken land. Nothing of great importance, I assure you.

They have secured those items in designated drop boxes, and those now await pickup in the Scholar's Den. Don't worry: they are locked with an impenetrable seal to protect both the contents and the deliverer.

Bring those sealed containers to me, and I will reward you handsomely.</Description>
