  <Title>The Anima Trail</Title>
  <Description>So the Jailer seeks the Primus's sigil. We must beat the Mawsworn to it. To open the vault, we need to power it with anima.

You helped the Bonesmith repair the first conduit. The trail of anima in front of us leads to the next.

Come, we must make haste!</Description>
