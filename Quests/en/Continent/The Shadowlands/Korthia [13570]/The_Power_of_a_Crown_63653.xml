  <Title>The Power of a Crown</Title>
  <Description>We are ready.

The Court of Harvesters shall use the power of the medallions we have gathered thus far to locate the Medallion of Wrath. So long as they have not removed it from the realm we should be able to divine its presence.

This is not an easy ritual--the nathrezim specialize in avoiding detection. When you see the path, take it and move with speed.

And when you find them, wait for us before you engage.</Description>
