  <Title>War Prototype</Title>
  <Description>As Forgelite Prime, I always work to make something better!

But largest centurions, they are much too large to bring to Korthia. This, I fix. Here is Atleos, field colossus prototype. Vanguard of the Kyrian! 

It needs testing. More testing. Must be perfect against a powerful opponent.

Go, take Atleos and defeat a great Maw beast! Press all the buttons!</Description>
