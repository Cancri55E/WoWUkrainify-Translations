  <Title>Lost Records</Title>
  <Description>Some of the record keepers fled to this mountain when Korthia was pulled into the Maw.

I see no sign of them, but they may have left records behind. 

Take this beacon. I fashioned it using information from the previous record keepers you rescued.

It will lead you to any intact records that are on this mountain.</Description>

  <RewardText>Excellent. I should be able to extract the Primus's message from these records.</RewardText>
