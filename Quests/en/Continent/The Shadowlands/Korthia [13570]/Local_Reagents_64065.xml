  <Title>Local Reagents</Title>
  <Description>Korthia is an odd place. The wildlife here is different, likely due to years of exposure to the Vault and everything it contains.

Are you ready to try some experiments? We'll need a good stock of reagents first.

Near the Seeker's Quorum, you should be able to find shardhides, gromits, and razorwings. Watch out for their needles!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Shardhide Talons, $2oa Gromit Feet, and $3oa Razorwing Spines for Plague Deviser Marileth in Korthia.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This needle is so long and perfect! Well done apprentice. I can't wait to get started on our new tests!</RewardText>
