  <Description>Greetings, mortal!

I am on a mission to deliver messages to our allies here in exciting Korthia. However, I was unable to complete my task.

The messages I was programmed to transport were stolen by Mawsworn, and then incorrectly stored all over the ground.

Would you collect the messages and return them to me? I will then see them delivered to their intended recipients.

Thank you!</Description>
