  <Description>Mal'Ganis.

It has been many ages since I have said his name. And now I find we must hunt him down.

If he has the Medallion of Wrath then there is nowhere he can hide. We can use the other medallions we have recovered to locate him.

Join me in Sinfall and bring your dreadlord hunting party. I suspect we will have need of them.</Description>
