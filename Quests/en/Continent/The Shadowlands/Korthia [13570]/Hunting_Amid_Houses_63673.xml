  <Title>Hunting Amid Houses</Title>
  <Description>I have good news, $n. With the covenants working more closely together, Huln's hunt has found greater success. He has solid leads on two more Night Warriors here in the Shadowlands.

He wishes for you to meet him in Maldraxxus about the first. Huln awaits you at the Sepulcher of Knowledge.

Hurry, $n. Elune's power rips at Tyrande's essence. I do not know how much longer she can hold on.</Description>
