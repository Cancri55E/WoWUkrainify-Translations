  <Description>A new sigil for the Venthyr would require all seven medallions to forge.

The Primus was correct. The person we need is the Stonewright. Her grievances against the Unseen could fill a library and she holds the last of the medallions we need. I believe you and I are long overdue in convincing her to join our cause.

I will make the arrangements. We shall go properly this time, with gifts and diplomacy. 

You should warn Chelra, she will want to arrange an escort.</Description>
