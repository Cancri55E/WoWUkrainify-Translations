  <Title>Oozing with Character</Title>
  <Description>Apprentice! I've been looking for you.

Kevin has been such a wonderful helper in our experiments, I'd like to train my other oozes to be able to assist as well!

For Bloop, I'd like to know if their ooze is capable of propagation. Take them with you, and find those bears. Give them the command to inject the life form with their ooze and see what happens.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Bloop test their propagation ability in the Mauler's Outlook.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>How did the tests go? OH! Look at all of them! They're so cute!</RewardText>
