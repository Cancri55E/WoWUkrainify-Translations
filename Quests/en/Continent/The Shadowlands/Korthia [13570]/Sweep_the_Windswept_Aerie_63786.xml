  <Title>Sweep the Windswept Aerie</Title>
  <Description>The skies over Korthia are a dangerous place.

Not only do the Mawsworn threaten our forces; the native creatures are also openly hostile. We must keep the skies safe for our own winged allies and beasts.

The source of the native flyers is the Windswept Aerie. Go there and clear the aerie of aggressive creatures.

Then, we shall have aerial supremacy.</Description>
