  <Title>Secrets of the Vault</Title>
  <Description>What fortune! You rescued the record keepers before the Mawsworn could steal their knowledge of the vault's relics.

But their records are fragmented. Incomplete. I pray there's enough left to learn the truth.

I will attempt to coalesce the knowledge that remains into a message. If the Purpose wills it, we will learn what the Jailer wants and to whom this item originally belonged.

I must focus for a moment. Let me know when you are ready to begin.</Description>
