  <Description>Before Anduin followed the Jailer through the gateway, he dropped something.

I'm not sure what it was, but Jaina picked it up. Perhaps this is a sign that Anduin is still fighting back against the Jailer!

We need to find out what this object was, and why the young king left it for us.</Description>
