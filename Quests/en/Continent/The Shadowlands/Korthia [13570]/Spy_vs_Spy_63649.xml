  <Description>Nathrezim. Dreadlords. The Unseen Guests.

Call them what you will, they are a race that was crafted to be the greatest collection of spies and infiltrators in all of reality, once upon a time. 

Their intrusion has underestimated three things. Kael'thas Sunstrider, Baroness Vashj, and $n!

I have brought a tool Kael'thas and I used to detect nathrezim when we served under Illidan. And I am the matron of spies!

Let us hunt these intruders down.</Description>
