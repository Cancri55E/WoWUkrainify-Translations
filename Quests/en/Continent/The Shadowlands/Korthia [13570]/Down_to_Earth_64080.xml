  <Title>Down to Earth</Title>
  <Description>I can hear the wings of the Mawsworn in the sky up above, taunting us. 

But a bird in the hand can be crushed. 

Take my spear and prove your aim. Pull a few down and smite them. 

Be sure to use the spear. Do not traipse among them so that they will chase you back down to the ground. That's not the point.

I want to see you drag them out of the sky.</Description>
