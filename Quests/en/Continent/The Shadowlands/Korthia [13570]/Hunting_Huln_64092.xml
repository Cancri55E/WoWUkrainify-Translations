  <Title>Hunting Huln</Title>
  <Description>Huln is somewhere in the area, but the Stonewright isn't letting anyone in to her territory because of the recent, ah, troubles with Dreadlords. The guards won't let anyone in, and they're kicking out anyone who doesn't look like they belong.

Luckily for Huln, Cudgelface and I came up with a foolproof plan!

We just need to look like we belong and then we can ask around and find Huln. Easy!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Don a disguise then search Dominance Keep for Huln Highmountain while avoiding the guards.</LogDescription>
