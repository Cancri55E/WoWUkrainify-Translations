  <Description>I have seen many ebon wings in the Maw, but never brilliant golden ones.

Now that the aural sequencers are relaying information reliably, we should discover the source of these feathers.

Gold has value where you come from, does it not?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Follow the trail of golden feathers to find what dropped them.</LogDescription>
