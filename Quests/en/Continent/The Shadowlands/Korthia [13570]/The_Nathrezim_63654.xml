  <Title>The Nathrezim</Title>
  <Description>The Medallion of Wrath is more than just a powerful artifact. In the hands of a nathrezim it could be used to shape this realm to their dark purpose. What is more, while they hold it we are denied the ability forge a new sigil.

They already nearly destroyed the Ember Ward with their reckless schemes. I will not have my medallion used for their ends.

Come, let us get it back.</Description>
