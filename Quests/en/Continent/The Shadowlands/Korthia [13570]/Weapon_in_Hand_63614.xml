  <Title>Weapon in Hand</Title>
  <Description>A moment, $n.

I threw my axe Dra'gora at Helya during our first encounter in the Maw, and I haven't seen it since. If this is truly where she commands her forces, then perhaps it's held here.

I crafted that weapon in Nagrand, and it reminds me of many good days spent beside my family there. I want to feel its weight in my hands once again.</Description>
