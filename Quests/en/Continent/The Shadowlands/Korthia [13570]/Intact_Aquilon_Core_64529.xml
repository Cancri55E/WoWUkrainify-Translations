  <Title>Intact Aquilon Core</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The massive devourer was clutching this aquilon power core in its fist when it died, no doubt ripped from one of the destroyed aquilon around it. The power core appears to be almost entirely intact.

Deos in Keeper's Respite would be able to help you locate an aquilon that you could power with it.&gt;</Description>
