  <Title>The Blade in the Night</Title>
  <Description>Though my hunt has been arduous, I have two promising leads on additional Night Warriors. The first is here in Maldraxxus.

This tower contains records of those who arrived in Maldraxxus, including someone referred to as "The Blade in the Night." I believe this to be our next Night Warrior.

I encountered many traps on the way here. Doubtless we will find more within the tower. Someone is trying to stop us.

We will not let them succeed.</Description>
