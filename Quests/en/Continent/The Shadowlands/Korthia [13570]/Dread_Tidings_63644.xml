  <Description>The threat the nathrezim pose to our forces must not be underestimated. They are cunning, rivaling the best veterans of the House of Eyes, and we do not know their full plan.

Among the venthyr there is one whose wrath scourged the nathrezim from the Shadowlands for many thousands of years. 

I ask you travel to Sinfall, seek out Prince Renathal, and deliver to him this missive. I shall send one of my own spies, the Baroness Vashj, to meet you there. Make use of her experience with the nathrezim.</Description>
