  <Title>A Paladin's Soul</Title>
  <Description>Bolvar Fordragon has seen visions of a vault hidden deep within Torghast where the Jailer keeps souls he deems valuable.

Uther was struck down by a mourneblade. When such a weapon is wielded with rage, it can shatter a soul into fragments.

If the Jailer holds a part of Uther's soul, it cannot be fully mended until the lost piece is restored.

Take this attuned shard to Torghast, $p. It should guide you to the vault's location.

Find the lost fragment of Uther's soul so that he can be made whole.</Description>
