  <Title>Observational Records</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, Maw Walker, a moment of your time?

As you no doubt know, my cartel has quietly spread observational devices all across Korthia. But that data is no good to us if it is not retrieved. Which is where you come in.

The Seeker's Quorum records should be ready to collect. You won't see the devices themselves, but the data will appear to you as a bright orb.

Bring those data to me, and I will reward you handsomely.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Observational Records from Seeker's Quorum in Korthia.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The name "Seeker's Quorum" has puzzled me greatly since I learned of it. What are they seeking? What constitutes a Quorum? What did they do there?

These mysteries may be beyond us, or they may yet be revealed. And here is your reward, as promised.</RewardText>
