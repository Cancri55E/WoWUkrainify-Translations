  <Title>Strength to Weakness</Title>
  <Description>$p, the scrap metal we've been recovering has some interesting properties. I have come to believe the mawsworn are imbuing their armor and increasing its durability.

Take this lightning rod. First, you will need to get struck by lightning. Don't make that face. You'll be fine. But, you need to also be grounded on mawsworn metal. The large chains embedded in Korthia, near the Windswept Aerie should work.

Once you are... ah... energized, I will send a tauralus, Borrhas, to carry you into battle.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Empower the lightning rod, then kill mawsworn.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I told you it would be fine. How did the test go? I wish I could have seen the looks on their faces when their fancy armor was suddenly the reason they were being destroyed.</RewardText>
