  <Title>To the Vault</Title>
  <Description>Thanks to the Bonesmith's repairs of both conduits, anima should now be flowing to the vault. That gives us a chance to get inside--assuming we can reach it.

Our Maldraxxi allies have wrangled transportation to get us to and from the vault. I suggest we make haste.

If the Jailer's minions obtain the sigil of the Primus before we do, it won't just be Korthia that suffers. All the Shadowlands may be forfeit.

Let's go, Maw Walker. Our forces will be awaiting us.</Description>
