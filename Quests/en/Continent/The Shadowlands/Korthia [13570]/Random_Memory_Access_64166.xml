  <Title>Random Memory Access</Title>
  <Description>When the Jailer snared Korthia and dragged it toward the Maw, he destroyed so much in this place. Not only mountains and buildings, but the people, too.

Those people had lives, hopes, memories.

I have to think that they can't all be gone, and we might be able to save something of them that lingers.

Here, take some of my power. See if you can collect those memories. Bring them to me, and I'll keep them safe. 

No one should be forgotten.</Description>

  <RewardText>Thank you, $n. I'll make sure these memories are taken care of. 

I wonder what it would have been like, being here as one of them...</RewardText>
