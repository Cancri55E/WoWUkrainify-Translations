  <Title>We Move Forward</Title>
  <Description>It breaks my heart to see another land so utterly obliterated. I can imagine how beautiful Korthia must have been, once.

But we must not wallow in what we've lost. Like Ara'lon taught me: we don't have to stand still.

We can choose to fight.

You can help by taking anima back from those Mawsworn. We can put it to use, building up our own forces and defenses.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Plundered Anima from Scholar's Den in Korthia.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you, my friend.

Every bit of anima we collect gives me hope that we can heal the Shadowlands. One day, we will be whole again.</RewardText>
