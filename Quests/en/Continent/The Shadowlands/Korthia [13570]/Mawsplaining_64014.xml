  <Title>Mawsplaining</Title>
  <Description>There remains one task now before the glorious battle can begin. The horn must be anchored to the Maw so that its voice may pierce the barrier that surrounds that foul realm. 

How this can be done, I do not know. Seek out one that understands the mysteries of that place. Surely they can guide your hand.

Danica and her sisters will listen for Ilskahorn's call. They will answer when you need them, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ask Ve'nari's help to bind the Ilskahorn to the Maw.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That's quite an instrument you have there.

It seems the golden feathers were worth following, Maw Walker. You owe me yet again.</RewardText>
