  <Description>If the nathrezim have infiltrated Sinfall they will be communicating, and not just through hand gestures or spoken words. They like to use magical written messages concealed by a simple cantrip, invisible to the average observer.

However, I have developed an incantation that should allow you to see these messages.

Find these cryptograms and bring me their contents. I can translate them if they are beyond your understanding.</Description>
