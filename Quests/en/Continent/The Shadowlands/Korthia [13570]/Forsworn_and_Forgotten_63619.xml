  <Title>Forsworn and Forgotten</Title>
  <Description>Wait... I know you! The Maw Walker!

My brothers and sisters have been twisted... tainted. Some took power willingly from Helya, but others resisted. Now all of us are forced to submit to her power.

I escaped when the fighting started, but most of the remaining Forsworn are being subjected to horrific rituals.

Please, I beg you to free them. Then we will return to Bastion and submit to the Archon's judgment.</Description>
