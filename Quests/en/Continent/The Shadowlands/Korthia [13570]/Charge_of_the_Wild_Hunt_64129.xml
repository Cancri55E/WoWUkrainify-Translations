  <Title>Charge of the Wild Hunt</Title>
  <Description>Ever since I joined the Wild Hunt I've learned so much about how to fight and how to defend the realms. 

I admit I'm still learning. But I am so glad to be learning alongside you, and my runestag friend, Aldermeigh.

Aldermeigh is being trained to charge into battle with the bravery of a vorkai, but he needs practice. Will you take him out for a ride, and mow down all the Mawsworn you can?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Mount Aldermeigh and slay Mawsworn in Korthia.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You and Aldermeigh make a great team! Thank you for taking him out and dispatching so many Mawsworn.

One day, I too will ride with the Wild Hunt, and we will right many wrongs.</RewardText>
