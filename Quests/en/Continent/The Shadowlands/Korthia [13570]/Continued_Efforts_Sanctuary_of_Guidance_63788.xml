  <Title>Continued Efforts: Sanctuary of Guidance</Title>
  <Description>The attendant's home has been destroyed by the Jailer, but we can help them in this trying time.

Nearby is the Sanctuary of Guidance. They speak of it with reverence and great sadness. It is a place they go to pray and seek truth. It's currently infested with devourers.

Clear out the devourers, so they may once more seek solace in their rituals and prayers.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Clear the Sanctuary of Guidance of devourers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you, Maw Walker. I am sure the attendants will feel great relief and joy at being able to return to their holy place.</RewardText>
