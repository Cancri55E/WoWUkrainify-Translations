  <Description>There are those who held their affiliation with Kel'Thuzad secret even after he made his move. They too were involved in the fall of my Margrave, and they too shall die.

I have one name, Drava'ora, but there are more. Sin'dane had indicated these traitors carry marks of favor. She doesn't know who has them so we'll start killing until we find them.

The rest will see the example made.</Description>
