  <Title>Covenants Renewed</Title>
  <Description>Our efforts were focused on preventing the Jailer from shattering the barrier around the Maw and invading the rest of the Shadowlands.

Instead, he expanded the Maw itself to envelop Oribos and claim the Aribiter's sigil.

I do not fully understand what we witnessed atop Torghast. But the Primus certainly does.

It is time to enact his contingency plan. The covenants will arrive with their sigils shortly. 

Inform the Primus that we are ready to begin.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to the Primus, then claim the Sigils from each covenant.</LogDescription>
