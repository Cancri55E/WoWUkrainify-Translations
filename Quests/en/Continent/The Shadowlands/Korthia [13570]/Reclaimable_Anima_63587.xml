  <Title>Reclaimable Anima</Title>
  <Description>Mikanikos has explained much about Forsworn centurions to me, $n.

I cannot say that I understood all of it, but it seems he has not yet found a reliable way to return them to their proper operating standards.

Their anima can still be useful, though!

Adrestes has focused on how to rededicate the temple, but not on his own safety. I worry the process will drain much of his anima.

If you can reclaim cores from the Forsworn centurions, we can use them as anima stores for Adrestes.</Description>
