  <Title>Oozing with Character</Title>
  <Description>Apprentice! I've been looking for you.

Kevin has been such a wonderful helper in our experiments, I'd like to train my other oozes to be able to assist as well!

For Ooz, I'd like to know if they are able to consume organic material and increase in size.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Ooz test their growth ability on Shardhide in the Mauler's Outlook.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>How did the tests go? OH! Ooz! You're huge! You're even more beautiful than normal!</RewardText>
