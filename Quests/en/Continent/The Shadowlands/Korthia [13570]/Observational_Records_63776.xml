  <Title>Observational Records</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, Maw Walker, a moment of your time?

As you no doubt know, my cartel has quietly spread observational devices all across Korthia. But that data is no good to us if it is not retrieved. Which is where you come in.

The Scholar's Den records should be ready to collect. You won't see the devices themselves, but the data will appear to you as a bright orb.

Be sure to check in the caverns below ground, as well!

Bring those data to me, and I will reward you handsomely.</Description>
