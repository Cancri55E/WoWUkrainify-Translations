  <Description>$p. Here we are again, fighting alongside each other to protect the Shadowlands.

We're waging a losing war, but we might be able to turn the tide. I need you to seek out some very specific commanders of the Mawsworn forces. In every army, there's good commanders and bad ones. By taking out the good ones, only the bad ones advance, weakening the force as a whole.

Our Eyes have brought us the names. Now I just need you to kill them.</Description>
