  <Title>Hooking Over</Title>
  <Description>I've made some solid hookshots and grapple points. Don't worry--if they hold my weight, they'll hold yours!

They can get us across the chasm to the next anima conduit.

I'll go on ahead and wait for you. No telling what might be lurking over there.

The sooner we get the anima conduit working, the sooner we get into the vault and claim the Primus's sigil.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel to the floating island with a hookshot, then repair the anima conduit.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>What a ride! Keep that hookshot.

Just be careful using it. That thing will chew through any normal grapple points.</RewardText>
