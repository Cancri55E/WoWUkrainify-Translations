  <Title>See How THEY Like It!</Title>
  <Description>Just thinking about how the Jailer's forces breached Ardenweald makes me so mad! 

And when I get mad, I get even.

Or rather, I get your help with getting even! Slay those Mawsworn and bring back their emblems to show me how many you killed. 

I don't really care where you get them, as long as they come from those Maw jerks!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Mawsworn Emblems.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So many emblems! That makes me so happy.

Everything will be better when we've gotten the Jailer himself, but this will do nicely for now.

Thank you!</RewardText>
