  <Title>Into the Vault</Title>
  <Description>The destruction here is... overwhelming.

&lt;Tal-Galan quietly utters a prayer.&gt;

Anima flows into what remains of the vault. We should now be able to enter.

Once inside, I will work on recovering the Primus's sigil. 

Please show reverence within the vault. It is a sacred place that few are allowed to see.

Even the prophecies did not foretell that a living mortal would gaze upon the secrets within.</Description>
