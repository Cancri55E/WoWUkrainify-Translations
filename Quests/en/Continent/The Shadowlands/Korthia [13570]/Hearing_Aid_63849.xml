  <Description>How fortuitous! You just happened to be transferred to a location in which I have a certain... interest. Place the aural sequencers I gave you and I will attempt to establish a functional signal.

Such a perilous location will require the utmost discretion. You will want to use your ethereal cloak to avoid being seen.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place the Aural Sequencers in Desmotaeron to help Ve'nari eavesdrop on the inhabitants.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Perfect. Their secrets will soon be mine.

Pardon me. I meant to say "ours."</RewardText>
