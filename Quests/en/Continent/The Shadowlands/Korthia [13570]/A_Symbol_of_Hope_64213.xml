  <Title>A Symbol of Hope</Title>
  <Description>Before Anduin followed the Jailer through the gateway, he dropped something.

I don't think this was part of the Jailer's plan. It must be a sign that Anduin's soul is still his own!

&lt;Jaina opens her hand to show you a golden compass.&gt;

This was very personal to Anduin. I feel his presence upon it.

We need to know why he left it for us.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Assist Jaina in examining Anduin's compass.</LogDescription>
