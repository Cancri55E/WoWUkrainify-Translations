  <Title>Medallion of Wrath</Title>
  <Description>Maw Walker. I will march with my stoneborn into the depths of the Maw and rend the head off every nathrezim I find there.

However, Revendreth is still too strategic in this war to lose out of misplaced vanity. 

Therefore, as Harvester of Wrath, the second of that title, I offer you my medallion for safe keeping and utilization while I wage this war.

Use it to empower the Harvesters so they can prevent Denathrius from simply returning and regaining control with a snap of his fingers.</Description>
