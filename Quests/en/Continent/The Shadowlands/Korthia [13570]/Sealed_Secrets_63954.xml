  <Title>Sealed Secrets</Title>
  <Description>Ah, Korthia. What secrets will be revealed?

My associates have been hard at work, seeking to discover and procure various small items of interest throughout this broken land. Nothing of great importance, I assure you.

They have secured those items in designated drop boxes, and those now await pickup in Seeker's Quorum. Don't worry, they are locked with an impenetrable seal to protect both the contents and the deliverer.

Bring those sealed containers to me, and I will reward you handsomely.</Description>

  <RewardText>Wonderful! You brought everything that I asked for.

Again, do not worry about the contents of these boxes. They pose no threat to you.

Here is the reward I promised.</RewardText>
