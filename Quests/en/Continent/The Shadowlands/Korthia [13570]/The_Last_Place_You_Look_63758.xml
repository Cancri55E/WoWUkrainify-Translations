  <Title>The Last Place You Look</Title>
  <Description>I came here hoping to locate the Fatescribe or something to help me find him.

Evidence shows he was here and survived a Mawsworn attack. The only other place I haven't looked is a meditation chamber on the opposite side of the ruins.

It's too dangerous for me to head back into the Seeker's Quorum alone. Could you help me?

I must find the Fatescribe. It's a matter of great importance.</Description>

  <RewardText>Mad ramblings and incense. Weak clues, but they're all we have.
