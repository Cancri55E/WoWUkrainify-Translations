  <Title>Vengeance for Korthia</Title>
  <Description>While opening the vault is our priority, I  must ask a favor.

When Korthia was pulled into the Maw, my people were terrified. We fled to the area you see before you, a place of peace called the Scholar's Den.

The Mawsworn soon descended upon us. Most of my kind were slaughtered. Others were taken captive.

If I could claim vengeance myself, I would. But I... I am ill-equipped for battle. Not like you.

Please. Show these monsters that their defilement of Korthia will not stand!</Description>

  <RewardText>Vengeance will not bring back the fallen, but it gives those of us who survived a measure of satisfaction.</RewardText>
