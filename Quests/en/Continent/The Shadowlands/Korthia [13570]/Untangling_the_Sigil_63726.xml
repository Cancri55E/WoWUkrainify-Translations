  <Title>Untangling the Sigil</Title>
  <Description>The Primus's sigil is bound together with the magic of memory. It reminds me of something you have encountered before.

You made an ally of the Runecarver, that poor soul trapped in the bowels of Torghast. He took those memories you found and helped you forge them into weapons and armor.

Perhaps he can separate the sigil from this tangle of memories.

It's our best chance to secure the sigil. But the way will be perilous.</Description>
