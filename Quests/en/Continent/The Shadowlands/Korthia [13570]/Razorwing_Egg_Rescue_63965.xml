  <Title>Razorwing Egg Rescue</Title>
  <Description>I'm amazed by the wildlife here in Korthia! So many interesting creatures...

Say, you know those flying beasts with the claws, the Razorwing? They sometimes knock their eggs out of their nests, and then they completely ignore them! If you find any abandoned eggs, could you bring them to me?

Gently, of course. I wonder if they can be raised to be friendly?

If not, well, it wouldn't be the first time I've had my antennae chewed on.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Razorwing Eggs.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Look at these wonderful eggs! I can hear their heartbeats.

This is the start of something beautiful, I just know it.</RewardText>
