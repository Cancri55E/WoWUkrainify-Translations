  <Title>Directing Dedication</Title>
  <Description>The five temples of Bastion have stood strong since its very creation. The idea of rededicating one has never been broached before, and will no doubt require a significant amount of anima.

Underneath this temple are stores of anima we rationed for the drought. Now that anima is returning, we can use these reserves for our purposes.

You will need to use channelers and collectors throughout the grounds to redirect anima to the top. That should give me the power I need.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Redirect anima from the Citadel of Loyalty to the temple.</LogDescription>
