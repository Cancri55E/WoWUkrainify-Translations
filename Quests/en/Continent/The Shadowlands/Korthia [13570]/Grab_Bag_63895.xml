  <Title>Grab Bag</Title>
  <Description>Interesting. Aural sequencers and an ethereal cloak. You hang on to those, $n. I have a suspicion they will prove useful.

Ah, and something special for me as well. If I'm not mistaken--and I so rarely am--this is a projection mechanism. Very handy!

And what's this? A transportation device of some kind. We should test it immediately.

By "we," of course I mean you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Test the transportation device from Ve'nari's bag.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This projector is certainly useful. A safe landing, I perceive.</RewardText>
