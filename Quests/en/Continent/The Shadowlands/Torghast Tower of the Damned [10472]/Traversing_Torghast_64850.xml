  <Title>Traversing Torghast</Title>
  <Description>I've heard of you, the Maw Walker! You must know of me, the legendary Ve'nish.

I am here to find great treasures within Torghast with the aid of my box. I can see you admiring it.

Perhaps we can work together. Why don't you go into Torghast ahead of me to scout ahead?

I shall even reward you for anything you discover within.</Description>
