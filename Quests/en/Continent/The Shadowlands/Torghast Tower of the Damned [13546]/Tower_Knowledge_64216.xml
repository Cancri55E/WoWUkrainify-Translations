  <Title>Tower Knowledge</Title>
  <Description>The woven power of this box can only be unlocked by feeding it pride and memory. In its weave are incantations I have seen used in the other realms to siphon or condition a soul. This... abomination... has used these tools of redemption and honor to create a lock.

As you challenge the floors of Torghast, your skill, speed, and efficiency will all contribute to Tower Knowledge which this box can feed upon. 

Feed it to retrieve the powers within.</Description>
