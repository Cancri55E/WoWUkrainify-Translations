  <Description>The Primus forged a fine blade, but it will do you no good in its current state.

Fortunately for you, I possess the skill to finish his work!

That being said, I will require materials. The other Chosen have been too preoccupied with their combat drills to assist me at the forge, even as they demand more weapons and armor.

That's where you come in. You want a new blade? You'll have to earn it.</Description>
