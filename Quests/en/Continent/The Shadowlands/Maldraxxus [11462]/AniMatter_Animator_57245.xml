  <Title>Ani-Matter Animator</Title>
  <Description>This area is rich with the remains of fallen soldiers... some of which still carry a spark of potential.

I've created what I call the "Ani-Matter Orb," with which you can reanimate the skeletal matter littered throughout the foundry. 

Let us see how many of the new animates would join our cause.

As for those who don't... well, they should be quite accustomed to being slain by now.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recruit $1oa animates.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>These reanimated troops will be put to good use.</RewardText>
