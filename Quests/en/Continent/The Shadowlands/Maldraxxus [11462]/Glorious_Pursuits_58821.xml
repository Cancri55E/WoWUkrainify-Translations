  <Description>Perhaps Draka has forgotten her loyalties, but I will fulfill my mission.

My enemy--the lich Mor'Bitan--hides within the House of Rituals. For some reason, his underlings skulk in this marsh.

We have not learned why they are here, but my devoted have spotted Mor'Bitan's second-in-command, Mephiles the Loyal. He will have our answers.

Collect him for me. Once you capture him, slay his kin. Weaken his resolve.

I will prime my base for his interrogation.</Description>
