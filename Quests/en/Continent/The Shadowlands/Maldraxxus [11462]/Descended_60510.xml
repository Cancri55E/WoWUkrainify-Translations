  <Description>Though we have stopped the creation of more juggernauts, one of their most vile creations yet draws breath. It was born of one of the most pained souls they took from my temple in Bastion.

As I flew above their ranks I could hear their surgeons chanting its name above the din of combat--Woeblade. It is an affront to all the kyrian stand for, an atrocity beyond any other.

Mark it with the flames of courage when you engage, and we will help you destroy it.</Description>
