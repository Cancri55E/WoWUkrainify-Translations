  <Title>Stabbing Wasteward</Title>
  <Description>I've been finding a lot of tauralus corpses lately, and I know it's all because those bonetooths Caleesy loves so much!

I spotted the one that's responsible for the slaughter just west of here. Get rid of it! 

And don't mention this to Caleesy!</Description>
