  <Title>Pumped Up</Title>
  <Description>When this necropolis collapsed, plenty of its parts got submerged in the riverbed flowing just outside. I hope you're really dedicated to fixing this place, because we're gonna dredge those parts back up!

Take this pump. If you find any places bubbling in that sludge, that's a good sign parts will be there!

Just be careful with whatever you pull up! You could face some resistance.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Salvaged Gear by using the Sludge Pump near bubbling sludge.</LogDescription>
