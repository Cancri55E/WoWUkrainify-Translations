  <Title>An Opportunistic Strike</Title>
  <Description>I'm impressed you made it this far. But don't get too full of yourself.

Most of the fodder you plowed your way through were amateurs at best. Only one combatant will leave this arena a champion.

Each of the five... uh, three houses has fighters in the field. Most merely seek to test their own limits or earn a bit of favor. Only a few have a real chance at claiming victory.

Seek out those challengers if you wish to claim true glory this day.</Description>
