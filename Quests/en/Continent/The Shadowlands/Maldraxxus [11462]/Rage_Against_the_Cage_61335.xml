  <Title>Rage Against the Cage</Title>
  <Description>You're looking for a mechanic, are you? Look no further!

I've been toiling on a new necropolis for ages. When Nurakkir collapsed, we saw a golden opportunity! We came to salvage parts from the wreckage, but these brutes locked me up when I criticized their methods.

But now you need help, right? I'm your construct!

You get me out of here, and you've got yourself a new mechanic!</Description>
