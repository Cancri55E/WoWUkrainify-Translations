  <Title>Seeking the Baron</Title>
  <Description>Take this amulet. One like it is carried by each of the Four Horsemen.

The amulets are imbued with a power that links them to one another. That connection should help you locate Darion Mograine.

No doubt Darion has witnessed countless horrors in the Maw. Perhaps he has caught sight of the missing baron.

Let us hope he can lead you to our Azerothian allies as well.</Description>
