  <Title>No Friend Left Behind</Title>
  <Description>I would care for nothing more than to serve as navigator again, but my dearest friend suffers. I cannot stand to abandon him.

I can feel Twigin now. He struggles against the binding web of the spiders who once served us. More victims of this senseless conflict...

Though it pains me to say it, you must slay our spiders and gather their caustic venom. You can then use it to free Twigin.

If not out of empathy, rescue him for the sake of your plans. My skills will be useless without his direction.</Description>
