  <Description>Gaining entrance to the Sepulcher is no easy feat, $n!

Not only were guardians put in place, but an elaborate magical lock was created to seal the door. 

To open the way, the two obelisks which control the lock must be fed anima. Fortunately, there are some empowered crystals in the area we can use for this purpose.

Locate the focus crystals and redirect their anima flow into the obelisks. Then the secrets of the Sepulcher will soon be ours!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Connect the anima flow to the Unlocking Obelisks.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You have done it! The door is unlocked!</RewardText>
