  <Title>Aerial Advantage</Title>
  <Description>Gharmal's rocs dominate the skies above, striking at our forces as we advance. We cannot move the necropolis into position until they are cleared out!

I would slaughter them myself, but the cowards remain out of reach, and I am not constructed for flight.

You, however, seem slight enough of build. Take my riding hook and latch onto a roc. 

Once you are atop of one, beat it to a pulp. Worry about the landing later.</Description>
