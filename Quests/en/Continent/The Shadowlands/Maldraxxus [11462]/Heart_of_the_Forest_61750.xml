  <Title>Heart of the Forest</Title>
  <Description>The baron requests a veilwing's heart, but procuring one is going to be something of a problem. 

&lt;Jor'dan gestures to the disarray nearby.&gt;

As you can plainly see, one of our sorcerers proved incapable of restraining the beast. I regret to inform you that our only specimen has escaped.

It cannot have gone far, though. If you follow its tracks you should be able to catch up with it and retrieve the heart yourself.

I assure you the baron will not be able to perform his ritual without it.</Description>
