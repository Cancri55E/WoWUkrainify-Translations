  <Title>An Early End</Title>
  <Description>Within the Hall of Chains lie more constructs that are nearly complete. As we speak, the Margrave's forces work fervently to graft the last pieces of flesh to their horrific visages.

If they are allowed to finish their work, then the destruction we have wrought thus far will make little difference in the final conflict. Our flank will be overrun by a fresh wave of horrors, and the day will be lost.

That must not come to pass. Destroy any of these abominations you encounter.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy $1oa Inert Butchers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Every abomination denied is one less foe to contend with when we face Gharmal.</RewardText>
