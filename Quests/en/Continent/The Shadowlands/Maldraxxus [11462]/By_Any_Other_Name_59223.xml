  <Description>Excellent work, my apprentice! Our laboratory is back in working order!

Now, there is one final ingredient we require to complete our potion for Margrave Stradama.

You will need to run along to the greenhouse. I've cultivated a sprig of dreadshade that should be ready to harvest.

I will prepare the other reagents while you're away. Be safe, apprentice!</Description>
