  <Description>What a nasty little plague you've brought me, apprentice. Must've been concocted by a true sadist.

To study the sample, I gave it form. But the ungrateful thing turned on me and attacked, completely unprovoked! 

It's shuffled a bit further on into the House. I hate to say it, but I believe this one must be put down before it is allowed to grow any stronger... or larger.

Look on the bright side. If your plague eater manages to survive, it'll be attuned to your particularly terrible form of blight.</Description>
