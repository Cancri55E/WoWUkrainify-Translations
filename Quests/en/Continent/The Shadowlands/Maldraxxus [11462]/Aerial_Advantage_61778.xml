  <Title>Aerial Advantage</Title>
  <Description>Gharmal's rocs dominate the skies above, striking at our forces as we advance. The Zerekriss can't get into position until they are cleared out!

I would take care of them myself, but I'm not much of a flier. Don't have the balance for it!

Take my riding hook and latch onto a roc. Once you're riding, just start hitting it 'til the job is done.</Description>
