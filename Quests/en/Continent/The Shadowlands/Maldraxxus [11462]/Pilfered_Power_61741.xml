  <Description>The illusion ritual will require a substantive amount of anima to complete. Since such a resource isn't simply lying around these days, we will need to take some.

The abominations from the House of Constructs recently arrived with a delivery of anima-rich spoils from the raid on Bastion. 

Use the maldracite crystal I've included in the parcel to extract enough anima for our ritual.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Drain anima from the Kyrian Spoils in the House of Rituals to fill the maldracite crystal.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This should be sufficient.

Let us prepare for the ritual.</RewardText>
