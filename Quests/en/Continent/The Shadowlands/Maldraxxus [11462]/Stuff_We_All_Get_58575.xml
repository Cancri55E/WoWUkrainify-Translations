  <Title>Stuff We All Get</Title>
  <Description>A lot of competitors meet their end in the Theater of Pain. But their weapons are still good as new!

It can get expensive to equip a fresh recruit, especially if you're not sure they'll survive their first bout. That's why we outfit them with "slightly used" armaments.

Gather them up for me, would you? Can't let a good weapon go to waste!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Weapons of the Fallen.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>These weapons will be put to good use. Hopefully, we won't have to collect some of them again.</RewardText>
