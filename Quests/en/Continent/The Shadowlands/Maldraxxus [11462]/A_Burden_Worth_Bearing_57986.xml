  <Title>A Burden Worth Bearing</Title>
  <Description>Mevix may be here for blood, but what I want is to spare my fallen kin from a terrible fate.

Most of my fellow kyrian were either slain in combat or shortly after arriving here. If their corpses were bound for this pit, then perhaps we can recover them before they are thrown into it.

Take the stewards with you and gather the bodies of my brethren. I will not allow them to be made into monsters.</Description>
