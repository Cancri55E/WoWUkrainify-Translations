  <Title>The Wayward Baron</Title>
  <Description>It has come to my attention that you seek to uncover a plot by the baron Kel'Thuzad. 

That upstart has been a thorn in my side since he arrived at the House of Rituals. Not only did he pilfer my rightfully earned title, he has since shut me out of the house's dealings.

I have yet to find evidence that would mar Sin'dane's adoration for her new baron, and thus I offer an arrangement. I grant you access to the House of Rituals, and in return you help me bring down Kel'Thuzad.

Do we have an accord?</Description>
