  <Description>I see why Draka sent you in her stead--you accomplish what she could not.

We have all the pieces. Now, we must simply put them together.

The steps to the ritual are simple: place our fractured crystals in formation around the obelisk.

Then comes the sigil--*our* sigil. Use the maldracite powder to draw a binding glyph at the obelisk's base.

When you are through, return to me.</Description>
