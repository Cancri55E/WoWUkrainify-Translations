  <Title>Bet On Yourself</Title>
  <Description>Dear Maw Walker... my friend... you're going to lose. Everyone knows you can't compete in the arena. 

The entire Challenger's Promenade knows it, the brokers in Oribos know it, even Zo'umlo knows it.

I've brought in a special challenger just to prove the point. Face Ti'or in the Theater of Pain and prove us wrong... or prove us right.

We will be betting, so don't disappoint.</Description>
