  <Title>The Other Foot</Title>
  <Description>It is a fool's errand to command a necropolis without someone to repair it and keep it airborne. Nurrakir's mechanic was slain in the crash.

But opportunity arises in dire times. Vyn has told me of an... altercation among the constructs. One of their own resisted the reckless scavenging of Nurakkir, and was promptly detained for his objections.

Find this individual. An enemy deserter could make for a potential ally.</Description>
