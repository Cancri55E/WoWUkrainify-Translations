  <Title>In The Flesh</Title>
  <Description>The souls of the fallen kyrian... I can sense their pain and confusion. They yet exist within the construct!

Please, we must not destroy it. Doing so would consign the souls within it--the souls of my brethren--to oblivion. 

Perhaps... perhaps they can aid us in escaping to freedom. I will soothe the souls within the construct while you direct its actions.</Description>

We will recuperate here for now. At least until we find a way to return to Bastion.

Thank you for showing me what courage is, my friend.</RewardText>
