  <Description>The old baron for the House of the Chosen? Ah, yes! I do think I remember seeing him! An angry soul, but very good at fighting.

He went off to meet with some member of the House of Rituals. There were a few of his guards with him.

While it's been quite some time since he passed this way, you may be able to find some signs of where he went towards the old footpath up the mountains.</Description>
