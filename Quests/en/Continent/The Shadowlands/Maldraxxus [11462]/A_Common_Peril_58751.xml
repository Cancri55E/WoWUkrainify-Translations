  <Title>A Common Peril</Title>
  <Description>Each house in Maldraxxus has two barons. Before the fall of my first house--the House of Eyes--our margrave sent my fellow baroness to investigate suspicious behavior in the House of Rituals.

I have not heard from her since. Either she has found something... or has become another casualty of their treachery. 

Her orders took her to the Decay in the east. If you can find the baroness, give her this summons. 

We were not friends, she and I, but she is a formidable combatant. We could use her might.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate the lost baroness in the Renounced Bastille.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Be thankful I am the one you found here.

Others in Maldraxxus may not have seen the potential in your strength.</RewardText>
