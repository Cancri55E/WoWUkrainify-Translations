  <Description>Ah, mortal, how fortunate that I, humble Ta'eran, happen to be standing here just as you, the outsider everyone is talking about, happens to wander by!

In the spirit of cooperation and mutual interests, there is a matter I wish to discuss.

If you would do me the honor of escorting me to the Sepulcher, I can share what else I know.</Description>
