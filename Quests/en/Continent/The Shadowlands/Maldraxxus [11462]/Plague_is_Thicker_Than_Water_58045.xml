  <Title>Plague is Thicker Than Water</Title>
  <Description>Come closer, my apprentice... I have a mission of dire import!

A necromancer came to our house recently, sent by the lich Margrave Sin'dane! He seemed so polite, always eager to lend a hand in my lady's most volatile creations.

But I grew wise, my apprentice. The way he skulked around, prodding for our most sensitive experiments...

He was trying to steal our slimes! I know it!

You should admonish him quite harshly. Show that no harm will come to our friends!</Description>
