  <Title>The Path to Glory</Title>
  <Description>It's been some time since I had a chance to craft a weapon that powerful! Good to know that the skills I learned from the Primus haven't dulled.

You'd best get back to the baroness with that runeblade. I'm sure the margrave will want to know you wield it, as well.

The Primus was notorious for thinking ten paces ahead of everyone else. I suspect he knew that someone like you would take up that blade.</Description>
