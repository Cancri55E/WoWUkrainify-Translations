  <Title>A Helpful Hand</Title>
  <Description>It takes but a simple act of necromancy to animate a hand. Unfortunately, since you will be in closest proximity, you must be the one to command it.

When you are ready, I will reanimate the hand. Once you have control, use it to pull the lever at the end of the hall. 

Couldn't be simpler, right?</Description>
