  <Description>We will have to construct an illusion to allow you entry into the House of Rituals. However, not just any illusion will do. In order to join Kel'Thuzad's inner circle, we require something... specific.

We're going to need a body.

Fortunately for us, one of the baron's favorite acolytes is performing a ritual outside of the house itself. You'll need to fight your way to her, but of that I'm sure you're capable.</Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>Acolyte Nelesis</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>A favorite necromancer of the barons. Performing a dark ritual nearby.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Defeat Acolyte Nelesis and bring her corpse back to the tower near Scaplian Ridge.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I must say it was satisfying watching you wipe the smug look off of Nelesis's face. She always thought she was so superior.

But enough revelry. We have work to do.</RewardText>
