  <Title>Cage Free Spores</Title>
  <Description>I will need your assistance with the collection of one other reagent for your master. These spore clusters he requests--while normally a trivial matter--will require a bit of work.

You see, as the veilwing rampaged throughout the Reagentry, it toppled and broke several nearby cages hosting the blightrays from which we harvest the clusters.

You will have to collect them through more... conventional means. 

The clusters are fragile, however, so try not to damage them while subduing the creatures.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Intact Spore Clusters from Escaped Blightrays in the Reagentry.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This should do.

I will assemble the reagents together to return to your master posthaste.</RewardText>
