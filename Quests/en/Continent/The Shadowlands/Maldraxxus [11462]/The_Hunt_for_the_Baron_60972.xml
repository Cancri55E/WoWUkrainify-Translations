  <Title>The Hunt for the Baron</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The amulet Bolvar gave you flickers with a faint red light, then grows dim.

To be useful in finding Darion Mograine, you must find a way to restore its potency.

You recall an area called Zovaal's Cauldron that was teeming with dark magic.

Perhaps the amulet's power could be restored there.&gt;</Description>
