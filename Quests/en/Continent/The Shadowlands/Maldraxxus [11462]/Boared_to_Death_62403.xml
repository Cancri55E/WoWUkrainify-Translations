  <Title>Boared to Death</Title>
  <Description>The boars around Maldraxxus have a peculiar trait. Their tusks absorb liquid. Depending on where it has been, these bones may contain a powerful compound of poisons or other alchemical rarities.

It takes a trained eye to tell what the bone is made of, so just bring back a large amount of them. From there I will see if any of them are valuable.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa bloody tusks from the boars in Maldraxxus.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>A fine amount. There will surely be something useful in this collection.</RewardText>
