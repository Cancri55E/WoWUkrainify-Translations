  <Title>Secrets Among the Shelves</Title>
  <Description>Now that the door to the Sepulcher is unlocked, we can venture inside.

And by "we", I mean "you". Until it's safe, at least.

The volumes within contain the collected wisdom of the greatest military minds of Maldraxxus. For the good of the Necrolords, do whatever is needed to gather these precious volumes.

It is safe to assume that the books will be protected by traps. The Primus wouldn't want just anyone laying their hands on this knowledge.

Once you clear a path, I'll join you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover volumes of the tomes kept within the Sepulcher.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Fine work so far.

Access to the secret archives is almost ours!</RewardText>
