  <Description>Bonetooths are the backbone of Maldraxxus's armed forces. Those that have been trained well are in demand amongst all of the houses.
 
I always need new bonetooths to train, but they can be rather difficult to collect.

Bring me some of the younger ones, and I will reward you greatly. Be advised that you may need to weaken them before you are able to capture them.</Description>
