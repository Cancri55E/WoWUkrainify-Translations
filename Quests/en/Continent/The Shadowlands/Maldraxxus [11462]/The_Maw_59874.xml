  <Title>The Maw</Title>
  <Description>$p, your arrival has set Maldraxxus ablaze. If you have any honor, you will do as I ask.

I believe I know where our answers may lie. The baron preceding Draka was lost to the Maw. It is said you have entered that dark abyss... and returned.

If the baron survived, he may know our next course of action.

You came here from Oribos. Return there, and see if you can find a way back to the Maw.</Description>
