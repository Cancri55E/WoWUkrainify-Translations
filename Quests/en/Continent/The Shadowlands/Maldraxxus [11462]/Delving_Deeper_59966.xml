  <Title>Delving Deeper</Title>
  <Description>It's quite a thrill to have a mortal for a business partner! The amulet really is intriguing.

What's that? Oh yes, that baron you're searching for...

Well it so happens that I learned of a Maldraxxi warlord being held in the lower courtyard of Perdition Hold. As you might guess by the name, it's not the most charming of places.

I would prefer to avoid the attention of the Jailer's forces. Fortunately, I have just the thing.

Give the word, and I will conceal us from the Mawsworn.</Description>
