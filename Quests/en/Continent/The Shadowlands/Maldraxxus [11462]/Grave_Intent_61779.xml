  <Title>Grave Intent</Title>
  <Description>My spies have identified several astral projectors that Margrave Gharmal uses to rally his troops in the Stitchyard.

See to it that these projectors are destroyed. We believe them to be along the yard's perimeter.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy the Southwestern, Northwestern, and Northeastern Astral Projectors.</LogDescription>
