  <Description>Let us ponder the meaning of the Archivist's last words: "Victory only belongs to those brave enough to fall."

Hmm. It could be reference to the Volume of Victory. That is the most well-known of all the writings said to be kept in this tower.

That book is priceless, $n. I mean that almost literally. We must do whatever is necessary to find it!

But, uh... What do you suppose "brave enough to fall" refers to?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Jump from the tower.</LogDescription>

It must be mine! Uh, ours. I mean ours!</RewardText>
