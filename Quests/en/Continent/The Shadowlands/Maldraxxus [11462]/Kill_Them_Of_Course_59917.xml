  <Title>Kill Them, Of Course</Title>
  <Description>These mindless monstrosities hail from the farthest reaches of the Shadowlands. The anima drought has fueled their relentless hunger, driving them to seek new sources.

They tear at the land searching for any anima they can find. We must thin their numbers and buy time to safeguard the knowledge locked within the Sepulcher.

Exactly the sort of work you're accustomed to, yes?</Description>
