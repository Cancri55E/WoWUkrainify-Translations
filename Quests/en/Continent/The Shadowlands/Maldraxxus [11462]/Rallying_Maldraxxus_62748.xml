  <Title>Rallying Maldraxxus</Title>
  <Description>We need all the help we can get! It's taking all we have to hold our ground against the other houses, let alone gain any ground against them.

Truth be told, your blade will be welcome anywhere. There are no shortage of battles to be won, foes to be toppled, or weary soldiers to be relieved.

Help us regain control of Maldraxxus, and in the name of the Primus I will see you are amply rewarded.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Aid Maldraxxus by completing Side Quests, Bonus Objectives, World Quests, and slaying rare creatures. You may also defeat powerful foes in Maldraxxus dungeons.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>All who have reported back to me have said the same--you have brought victory upon victory to the House of the Chosen!

On behalf of all who serve the Primus, you have my eternal gratitude.</RewardText>
