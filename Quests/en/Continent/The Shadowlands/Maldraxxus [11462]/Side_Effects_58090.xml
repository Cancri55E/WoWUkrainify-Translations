  <Description>Scrapper Minoire's use of enhancers creates unpredictable betting implications. It is quite unhealthy... for our profits!

For a nominal fee, Au'larrynar can provide you with a "special" enhancer that Minoire will not be able to resist: a potion that turns the one who imbibes it into the ultimate combatant... and teaches them a lesson in restraint, as well.

I cannot wait to see Minoire's next match in the arena!</Description>
