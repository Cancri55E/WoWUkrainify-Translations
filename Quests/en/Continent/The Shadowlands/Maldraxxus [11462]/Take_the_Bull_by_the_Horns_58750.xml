  <Description>I've carved out quite the reputation as a tauralus wrangler. Everyone needs a tauralus!

You do some work for me, and people will know who you are as well.

Take this bone splinter and poke a few juicy nibblers. Use them to lure a tauralus to you, then ride it back to me.</Description>
