  <Title>Slime, Anyone?</Title>
  <Description>While I know we're both eager to complete our potion, I believe the best lesson I can share with you is patience.

Patience and slimes, of course!

With the help of slimes, we'll have our laboratory back in working condition. It's just as I taught you: combine your ingredients in the cauldron. Mix until the viscosity is just right...

Oh, listen to me--acting as if you've never concocted your own sentient being!

Go on, my apprentice! The slimes are calling!</Description>
