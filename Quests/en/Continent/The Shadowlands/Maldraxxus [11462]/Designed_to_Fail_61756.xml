  <Description>The pieces are all coming together. The kyrian, the Paths of the First Ones, and runes of domination? 

Kel'Thuzad is looking to breach the Maw!

We cannot allow this to happen! The Maw has been locked away from the Shadowlands for good reason. Opening that floodgate could be catastrophic!

The baron is too powerful to confront headlong, so we will stop his ritual instead. Return to him with his reagents. I have made some "modifications" that should provide a calamitous end to his scheme.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Bundle of "Modified" Reagents to Kel'Thuzad in the Vault of Souls.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I see you managed to procure the reagents from Jor'dan, and... wait, what's this?

I am impressed that you managed to procure the shipment from the brokers when my sorcerers could not!  

You are quite the resourceful one, acolyte!</RewardText>
