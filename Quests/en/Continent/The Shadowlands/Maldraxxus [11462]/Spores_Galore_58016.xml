  <Description>My brightest apprentice, you return to me at last!

You worried me--you see, I heard the loudest clatter while working on one of my experiments... Before I knew it, I was here, and you'd disappeared!

Wherever you went is no matter. You're back now, and we have much to do!

Come, my apprentice--we must fetch our ingredients first.

Can you smell the spores germinating around us? We should pull some up to use in our endeavors!</Description>
