  <Description>These Maldraxxi fiends have reoccupied my temple. They have entrenched this resurgence with shields powered by necromancy.

My disciples--the ones who were not captured and executed by your treacherous compatriots--report the core of a necrotic bulwark to the south. We cannot counter their forces until the shield is brought down.

See it done. I will not tolerate your presence otherwise.</Description>
