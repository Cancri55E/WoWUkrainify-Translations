  <Title>Blade of Blades</Title>
  <Description>The finest sword in existence has been lost!

Never in your pitiful adventures have you encountered such a blade, mortal. Foe Cleaver was forged to strike down the titans themselves!

I have wielded it against countless adversaries. Emissaries of the Light, minions of the Void, meddlers from the Gardens of Life... all have fallen before me! Soon the very planes of reality will kneel to my greatness!

Once I find my weapon, that is.

I insist you help me reclaim it. I know it's here somewhere!</Description>
