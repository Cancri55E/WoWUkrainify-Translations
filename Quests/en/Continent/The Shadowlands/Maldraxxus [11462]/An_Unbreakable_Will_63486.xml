  <Title>An Unbreakable Will</Title>
  <Description>We're clearly dealing with someone who is using terrible magic to suspend his own death.

There's another force we know of that uses magic in this fashion. The Maldraxxi are intimately familiar with the trappings of death, and equally familiar with how to subvert it. Perhaps one of the Houses knows of a way to help us.

Go there, and seek out power that can break this unnatural loop.</Description>
