  <Title>Bring Me Their Heads</Title>
  <Description>I swore to the grave of Vistara the Fallen that I would bring him the head of the one who betrayed him. 

Though that was eons ago, it is an oath I must fulfill. Whatever fate ultimately befell the traitor, it is likely that his head can still be found nearby.

Slaughter everyone here. Surely one of them must be the traitor... or be in possession of his head.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Traitor's Heads.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I have asked many others to collect heads as well! So even if none of these are the traitor's head, we shall find it eventually!</RewardText>
