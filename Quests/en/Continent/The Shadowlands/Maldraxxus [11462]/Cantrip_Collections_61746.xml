  <Description>One of the... more regrettable duties of the Mistress of Tomes is the collation and maintenance of our scroll library. Unfortunately, many of our acolytes are less than prompt when it comes to returning items they have borrowed, which requires me to seek them out and retrieve them myself.

Of course, this is far too menial a task for a baroness, but that is why lackeys like you exist.

Go, and retrieve my scrolls. Feel free to use whatever persuasive means you have at your disposal.</Description>
