  <Description>The Arbiter's judgment was, as always, infallible.

Though Alexandros's devotion to the Light is undeniable, it is the memory of his loved ones that truly fuels his strength. He was meant for Maldraxxus, not Bastion.

Go now. Return to your leader with news of our victory today.

And tomorrow, we shall purge our foes once and for all.</Description>
