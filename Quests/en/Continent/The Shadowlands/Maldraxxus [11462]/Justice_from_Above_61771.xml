  <Title>Justice from Above</Title>
  <Description>Our forces above cannot fully descend upon this area while the Margrave's crystals cover the sky in destructive blasts.

The Margrave's foul butchers work even now to extract the remaining anima from the kyrian they abducted in their assault on Bastion. We must advance at once.

I shall imbue you with the flames of courage so that you may mark the crystals. Once marked, I will destroy them from afar.</Description>
