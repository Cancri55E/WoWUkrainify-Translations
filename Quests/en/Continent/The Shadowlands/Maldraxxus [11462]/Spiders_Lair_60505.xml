  <Title>Spider's Lair</Title>
  <Description>When our house fell in ruins, Manipulator Zalisar seized the opportunity to reform the house under his leadership. He found few followers and soon vanished into the ruins nearby. 

He has begun to manipulate the spiders and train them to be his soldiers. Spiders under his control have begun to prey upon our forces. We need to deal with this threat before it grows any worse.

I need you eliminate Manipulator Zalisar and his spider forces.</Description>
