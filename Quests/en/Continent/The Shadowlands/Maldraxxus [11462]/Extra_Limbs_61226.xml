  <Description>We cannot carry out the baroness's plans alone. What she proposes will require a well-coordinated unit.

Three individuals maintained Nurakkir alongside me. When the necropolis fell, two of my soulbinds fell with it.

There remains a single soul paired with mine. My sister, Xennir, survived the wreckage--though grief besets her.

Meet with Xennir. Guide her through her trauma, and return when she is ready to rejoin the fight.</Description>
