  <Title>Return to Brill</Title>
  <Description>We've strengthened our plague eater, and now it looks ready to take on a much, much bigger meal.

Let's get it back to Faranell. He said he can replicate its properties and disperse plague eaters all across the ruins.

Then maybe, just maybe, we can set foot in our home again.

Here, take my hearthstone. It'll bring you back to Brill.</Description>
