  <Description>Now you're starting to show potential! I'm guessing your name was well known on whatever mortal world you hail from.

But don't rest on your laurels. The harder you fight, the harder others will strive to strike you down. That's the Maldraxxi way!

Nothing wins the favor of the crowd like taking down a former champion. Two are in attendance today, attempting to recapture their past glories.

Slaughter them!</Description>
