  <Description>I witnessed your success with the Pool of Potions and I think you could be of help. Within this larger pool, we create more dangerous mixtures!

There are three different oozing ingredients we mix together in different combinations to create violent creatures. When enough ingredients have been added to the pool, the mixture takes shape and a creature will emerge!

Bring any combination of these ingredients, Mephitic Goo, Viscous Oil, or Miscible Ooze to the Pool of Mixed Monstrosities.</Description>
