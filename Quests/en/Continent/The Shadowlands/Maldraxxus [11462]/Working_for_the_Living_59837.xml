  <Description>I see you are wondering where we acquire all of the challengers we supply to this arena.

We scour countless realms in search of opponents to provide the Maldraxxi with firsthand combat experience. 

Currently, I am in the process of procuring a new combatant--and with it, a lucrative betting opportunity. 

Would you make use of our portal and assist Zo'umlo in capturing Khogov the Expunger? You will be appropriately compensated, of course.</Description>
