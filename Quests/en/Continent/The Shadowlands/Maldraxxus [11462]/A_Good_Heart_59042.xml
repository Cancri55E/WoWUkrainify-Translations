  <Title>A Good Heart</Title>
  <Description>Despite the beliefs of most people, Emeni has a kind heart.  Err...at least she will have one, once you give it to her!

I can think of no one better than you, Maw Walker, to give Emeni a new heart. Perhaps this will warm her blood towards you. You might become friends or even soulbinds!

Please select and place a heart in Emeni's construct.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place a heart in Emenis' construct.</LogDescription>
