  <Title>Entangling Web</Title>
  <Description>It would seem we have a means of luring Mor'Bitan to us. But what good is a web if the prey can run free?

For these rituals to work, the liches require a magical conduit. They draw runes with finely ground maldracite to channel anima.

I have no doubt Mor'Bitan's necromancers have ground maldracite in the area. If we gather enough, we can draw a rune of binding to trap our target.

Work with haste, $p.</Description>
