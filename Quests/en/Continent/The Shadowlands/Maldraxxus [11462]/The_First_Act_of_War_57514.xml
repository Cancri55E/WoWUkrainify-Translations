  <Title>The First Act of War</Title>
  <Description>Look around you, $p. This army is all that remains to defy the treachery of the other two houses.

I must regroup with the margrave and discuss strategy. War will soon be upon us.

I would ask that you prepare for the coming battle alongside the rest of our forces. We cannot afford for a single soldier to falter.

Seek out Baron Vyraz. He has earned countless victories for Maldraxxus. I fear his blades must soon be turned upon our former allies.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Report to Baron Vyraz.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Mark my words, recruit. We will crush the other houses for their acts of treason.</RewardText>
