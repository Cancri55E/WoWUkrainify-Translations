  <Title>Hope Never Dies</Title>
  <Description>So, mortal, you are here looking for someone. Well it just so happens that, clever as I am, it's quite possible I know where they are.

Allow me to propose a trade. That amulet you carry... it holds an interesting power.

You give me the amulet, and I will help you find this Maldraxxi baron.

And then you will leave. I don't mean to be rude, but I really prefer to keep a low profile.

Allow me to speed things along.</Description>
