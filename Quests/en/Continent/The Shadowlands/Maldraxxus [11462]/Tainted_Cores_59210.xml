  <Description>This lich seeks a reward for his assault on the House of Eyes. But the power he craves will be his downfall.

We will use our knowledge of his secret ritual to lure him out of the House of Rituals. 

Take these crystals, $n. Charge them with anima reclaimed from Mor'Bitan's slain minions.

But fracture them first, so that they shatter as the ritual nears completion... but not before Mor'Bitan believes that it has begun.

That is when we will strike.</Description>
