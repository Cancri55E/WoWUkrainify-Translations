  <Title>Errant Enchantments</Title>
  <Description>The House of Rituals is a place of constant study. Every day, new incantations and formulae are concocted to further the arts of necromancy. 

It can be difficult to keep track of such innovation. To aid in cataloguing our progress, our sorcerers have applied the use of enchanted quills and parchment. Unfortunately, if not properly stored, these implements tend to run amok. 

Of course, they were not properly stored.  Find the implements and return them to where they belong.</Description>
