  <Title>The Seat of the Primus</Title>
  <Description>This cannot be a coincidence. It is clear that your runeblade is somehow connected to the Seat of the Primus.

I will not pretend to know the Primus's agenda. But I would not be surprised if he left behind a way for the worthy to open the door to his sanctum.

Draka will bring you to the Seat of the Primus. If you hold the key, mortal, then our victory is all but assured.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Go with Draka to the Seat of the Primus.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We cannot lose sight of the battles ahead of us. The door will have to wait.</RewardText>
