  <Title>An Early End</Title>
  <Description>Within the Hall of Chains lie more abominations that are nearly complete. As we speak the Margrave's forces work fervently to graft the last pieces of flesh to their horrific visages.

If they are allowed to finish their work, the constructs we have destroyed so far will mean little in the final conflict. Our flank will be overrun by a fresh wave of horrors, and the day will be lost.

That must not come to pass. Destroy any abominations you come across.</Description>
