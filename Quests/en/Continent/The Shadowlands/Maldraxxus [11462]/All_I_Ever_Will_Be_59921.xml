  <Title>All I Ever Will Be</Title>
  <Description>This is the site of an ancient battle won by the previous Paragon of Courage. She sacrificed herself to serve the Shadowlands. I only hope my own end will prove as exemplary.

Many of my disciples meditate upon the scrolls here. With them, we remember the foundation of our courage.

Accompany Alexandros as he reflects on his shrines. Aid him in understanding where the source of his courage lies.

He will learn that this afterlife is not the one suited for him.</Description>
