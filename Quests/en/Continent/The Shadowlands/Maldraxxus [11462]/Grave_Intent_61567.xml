  <Title>Grave Intent</Title>
  <Description>My spies have identified several astral projectors that Margrave Gharmal uses to rally their troops in the Stitchyard.

I do not wish for a swarm of frenzied constructs to descend upon us during the final confrontation. Surely you see the wisdom in cutting their fervor.

See to it that these projectors are destroyed. We believe them to be along the yard's perimeter.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy the Southwestern, Northwestern, and Notheastern Astral Projectors.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Gharmal's influence runs deep in this place, but it will fade more quickly thanks to your efforts.</RewardText>
