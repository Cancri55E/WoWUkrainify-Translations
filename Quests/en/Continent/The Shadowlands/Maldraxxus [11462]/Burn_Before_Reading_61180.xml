  <Title>Burn Before Reading</Title>
  <Description>The scroll you recovered details all manner of horrific ways to 'integrate' fallen kyrian into Gharmal's constructs.

It is also incomplete. There must be more of these among Stitchflesh's remaining followers.

I saw a number of surgeons and their lackeys retreat into the Hall of Chains just ahead as we arrived. I suspect they hold more of these scrolls.

We must ensure they are never read again.</Description>
