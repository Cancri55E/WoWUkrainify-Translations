  <Title>Opening to Oribos</Title>
  <Description>The prophecies told us that one day this dormant waystone would be needed by a  Maw Walker. That it would prove crucial to the fate of the Shadowlands.

It seems that day has come.

Draw upon the anima within you to activate this waystone. It will then be usable by all those who aid your cause.

If, as you say, Tal-Inara has created an anchor in Oribos, then that anchor will bring you back to us.

Go, $n. Inform your allies that the Maw awaits... and that Korthia needs their help.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Activate the waystone and travel to Oribos.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak with Bolvar Fordragon within the Ring of Transference.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n. I am eager to learn of this realm pulled into the Maw.

It is time to begin our assault on the Jailer's forces.</RewardText>
