  <Title>The Eternal City</Title>
  <Description>You should become familiar with the Eternal City and how best to navigate it.

We, the attendants, serve Oribos as its caretakers. 

Everything you see here is done in service to the Purpose. In this time of chaos and drought, we must adapt our perspective. It seems we are to serve the Purpose in a new way.

You mortals are not the only visitors here. Others have come as well.

Like you, the brokers are not of Oribos. They are congenial and willing to aid you. Usually for a price.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Tour the Eternal City of Oribos.</LogDescription>
