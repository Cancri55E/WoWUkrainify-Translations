  <Title>A Doorway Through the Veil</Title>
  <Description>The Helm fragment connected us while you were in the Maw. As if through a darkened pane of glass, I saw glimpses of what you endured. The terrors you faced.

At least the heroes of Azeroth yet live. They must be saved.

By affixing the Helm here, you gave us a tether to Azeroth that served to bring a few of us across the veil. But you, and other heroes who join us, require a stronger connection.

Our acolytes can open portals back. No doubt these attendants will be particular about their placement.</Description>
