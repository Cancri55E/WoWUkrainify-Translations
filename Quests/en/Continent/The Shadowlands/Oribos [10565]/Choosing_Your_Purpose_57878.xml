  <Title>Choosing Your Purpose</Title>
  <Description>Each covenant is vital to the Shadowlands. Though they often seem at odds with one another, this too is part of the Purpose.

All the covenants need to grow strong to face the threat of the Jailer. But your efforts cannot be divided. They must be focused upon a single path. Other mortals may make a different choice.

The time has come for you to take a side. 

Speak to your allies. Then make your choice at the map of the Shadowlands before me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to the Covenants. Decide how your path is entwined with the Purpose.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>All is as expected. Trust always in the Arbiter's plan.</RewardText>
