  <Title>Audience with the Arbiter</Title>
  <Description>I am Tal-Inara, Honored Voice of the Arbiter. I speak for she who is ever silent.

The Arbiter watches over Oribos. She blesses us with her wisdom. Every mortal soul that enters the Shadowlands passes before her for judgment.

In the merest fraction of a moment, she sees every glory, every folly, every joy, every regret. With this knowledge, she chooses an ideal afterlife for that soul.

At least, she did. Not long ago, catastrophe struck, and ...

Come. Some things are better seen than explained.</Description>
  <LogDescription>The Voice of the Arbiter wishes you to join them in the Arbiter's chamber.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We may find a shared cause in the Purpose. It has sent you to us.</RewardText>
