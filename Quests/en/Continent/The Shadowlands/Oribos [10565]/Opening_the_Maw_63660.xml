  <Title>Opening the Maw</Title>
  <Description>The Jailer has gained another sigil, and his forces actively assault Oribos.

Bolvar Fordragon and Draka of Maldraxxus suggest taking the fight to the Jailer.

To do so, we need a way for their forces to safely come and go from the Maw.

This was considered impossible before you arrived, but now I believe we have a chance.

I must examine your anima to see if this is truly what the Purpose wills.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Allow Tal-Inara to examine your anima.</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>I do not do this lightly, Maw Walker, but we have no choice.

We must open a gateway to the Maw.</RewardText>
