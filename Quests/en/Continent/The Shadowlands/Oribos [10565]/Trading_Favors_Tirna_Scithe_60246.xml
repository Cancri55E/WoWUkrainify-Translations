  <Title>Trading Favors: Tirna Scithe</Title>
  <Description>The gorm devour anything in their path when left unchecked. We have sold more than a few of them as both pets and weapons. You do not want to see what a world looks like when they are introduced to it and allowed to infest.

Or perhaps, mhm, you do? For some, that is entertainment.

It is difficult for us to explore Ardenweald with things as they are at this time. A fat, healthy gorm larva would fetch a fine price on the markets. I trust my meaning is understood?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain an Engorged Gorm Larva from Tred'ova in the Mists of Tirna Scithe.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Oh, what is this? It is so bulbous and squirming, it must be close to the next molting. I am something of an amateur gorm-breeder myself, and will find a proper place to raise this one. 

You may trust that I intend to destroy no worlds, I give you my word.

Now, I must tend to him, gather something from our stocks on your way out.</RewardText>
