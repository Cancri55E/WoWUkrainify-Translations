  <Title>The Minions of Mayhem</Title>
  <Description>To all downtrodden and unappreciated hard workers of the Shadowlands: the time has come to rise up. Rise up and stick it to the fangs and the wings and the bonemen! Stick it to the brokers and the bossmons! I says we go into business for ourselves!

Come to our secret meeting at the Ledge of Destiny.

To all not-downtrodden warlords, Maw Walkers, and morally flexible powerful denizens: We are currently hiring muscle. If interested, please attend. 

Don't tell the fuzz.</Description>
