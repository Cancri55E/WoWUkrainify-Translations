  <Title>Our Last Option</Title>
  <Description>Zovaal has blocked our pursuit. If we are to defeat him, we must find a way to withstand Domination.

But to overcome it, we need to understand how it works. 

The Primus of Maldraxxus created Domination, he will be able to tell us more.

I asked Taelia to bring a piece of the Helm of Domination to Zereth Mortis. I dread to think of what might happen were I to try to carry it again... 

Let us discuss the way forward.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Listen to the plan.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I don't like this as an option any more than Taelia does, but we need to wield Domination safely if we are to find a way to overcome it.

Our first step is to ensure that the helm still works. On us.</RewardText>
