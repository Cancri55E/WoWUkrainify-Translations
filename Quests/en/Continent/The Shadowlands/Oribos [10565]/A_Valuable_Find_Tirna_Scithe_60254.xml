  <Title>A Valuable Find: Tirna Scithe</Title>
  <Description>The gorm are indiscriminate in what they consume, so long as it does not contain anima. A gorm queen that has lived for many generations may have any number of indestructible artifacts lodged within her belly. For this reason, sifting through a queen's carcass is not unlike treasure hunting for us.

One of the largest queens is currently consuming Tirna Scithe. She surely is bloated with valuables. Should you come upon anything particularly unusual, know that we will compensate you in kind.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Unusual Automaton Parts from Tred'ova in the Mists of Tirna Scithe.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We have found only a few objects similar to this in all of our time here, that I am aware of. Whether it belonged to a race of creature or automatons that came before us, or they still exist somewhere, we do not know.

The metallic fragments of this piece appear similar in design to the walls that surround us here in Oribos, yet we have never seen something like this moving around in the city.

I will add it to the cache of relics related to these mysteries. Take a suitable reward with you.</RewardText>
