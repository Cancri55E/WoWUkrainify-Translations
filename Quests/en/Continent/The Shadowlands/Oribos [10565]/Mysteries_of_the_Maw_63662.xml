  <Title>Mysteries of the Maw</Title>
  <Description>The Maw is changing, mortal. And with change comes opportunity.

The Jailer has pulled a realm that was hidden deep within the Shadowlands into the Maw. It is a location of some interest to me, but I do not wish to approach it alone.

The Mawsworn are swarming the area, you see. There must be something of value that they seek.

I have a safe enclave nearby. Accompany me there and I may be able to help you find that waystone you're looking for.

Do we have a deal?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel with Ve'nari to the site of the new landmass within the Maw</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak with Ve'nari outside the new area.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>The Jailer desperately wants something here, yet his precious Eye cannot breach its defenses.

Oh well. Shall we?</RewardText>
