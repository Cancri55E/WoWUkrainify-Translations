  <Title>Call to Lordaeron</Title>
  <Description>With the Shadowlands healing, it is time to turn our attention to matters close to home again, on Azeroth.

The Forsaken are mustering in the ruins of the kingdom of Lordaeron. They seek to reclaim as much as they can of the Tirisfal Glades, to finally put the destruction left by the Fourth War behind them.

And I intend to assist them in any way I can.

I also know that for the Horde, I have much to prove. Come, join me in Brill and we can help the Forsaken together.</Description>
