  <Title>Trading Favors: Necrotic Wake</Title>
  <Description>We of the brokers place value on things that may seem strange to an outsider like yourself. Objects that are unusual or one-of-a-kind are things we may find more valuable than others.

So let us make a deal, hm? Should you find yourself in possession of one such object, I will offer a trade for something you may find more valuable.

I hear that the forces of Maldraxxus have made an attack on Bastion. Such things rarely happen without objects of power in tow, no?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain Nalthor's Phylactery Instructions from Nalthor the Rimebinder in the Necrotic Wake.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ah, quite a find. We rarely get a glimpse into the mechanisms by which the House of Rituals enact their dark designs. I am eager to delve into this tome, purely in the interests of knowledge, of course.

You may choose from some of our procured items as a reward.</RewardText>
