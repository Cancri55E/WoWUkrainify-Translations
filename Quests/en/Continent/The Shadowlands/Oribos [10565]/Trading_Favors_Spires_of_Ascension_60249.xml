  <Title>Trading Favors: Spires of Ascension</Title>
  <Description>The Kyrians of Bastion serve a unique role in the Shadowlands, ferrying mortal souls from their realms to ours. They are able to do so in great numbers, it would seem, in times of crisis or devastation.

We would like to know more about their travels to the realms beyond. 

Surely one of them has brought something back from another land? They are, after all, so very interested in memories.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain a Strange Doll from Devos, Paragon of Doubt in the Spires of Ascension.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>A strange bauble, likely from another world. Yet, why would the paragon have brought this with her? 

Perhaps when carrying the soul of a child, as a reminder of something she had thought lost within herself? I will ponder this.

You may choose a reward from our stores.</RewardText>
