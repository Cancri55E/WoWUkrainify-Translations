  <Title>The Path to Bastion</Title>
  <Description>Within the Arbiter's Chamber are gateways to the infinite realms of the Shadowlands. As each soul was judged, a gateway would be opened to the appropriate afterlife. 

But since the... incident, all gateways have remained closed. Dormant.

We dare not use the Arbiter's sacred chamber for so mundane a purpose as travel. But here in the upper ring of the city, gateways can be configured for your needs.

Before us stands the means to activate a gateway. Together we can channel the anima to power it.</Description>
