  <Title>Observing the Chase</Title>
  <Description>In our observations of your kind's conflict, we have noticed a high rate of escape among the prey.

This is unadvantageous to our observation efforts.

The Observer has acquired a tool we believe will improve your ability to force conflict.

Before I give it to you, we ask that you prove your willingness to participate in such conflicts, so that we know we will receive a worthy return on this investment.</Description>
