  <Title>A Glimpse into Darkness</Title>
  <Description>When I put the Lich King's crown upon my head, I wanted the world to believe I was dead. Even my daughter, Taelia. I... thought a lie would be kinder than the truth.

But she is no longer the little girl I left in Kul Tiras. I see my choice was a selfish one.

&lt;Bolvar pauses.&gt;

She and Lady Menethil have asked me to peer into the Maw to see if our allies yet live. It is a dangerous request, but one I cannot refuse.

Help me focus on the broken helm. Together, we may find a glimpse of truth.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Witness Bolvar's vision of the Maw.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>A troubling vision indeed. But we must not give up hope.</RewardText>
