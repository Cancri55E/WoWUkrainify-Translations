  <Title>The Threads of Fate</Title>
  <Description>It is my duty to observe the strands of fate. The wondrous possibilities that the Purpose lays before us.

Fate flows around you, mortal. It shifts. It changes. But I have stilled its movements to offer you... a choice.

You may journey through the Shadowlands in the same manner as those who came before you have done.

Or you may choose a different path. One that lets you forge a bond with a covenant now, and move freely through the realms of Death to forge your own destiny.

What say you, mortal?</Description>
