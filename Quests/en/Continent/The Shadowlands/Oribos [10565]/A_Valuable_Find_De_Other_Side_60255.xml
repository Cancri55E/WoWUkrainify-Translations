  <Title>A Valuable Find: De Other Side</Title>
  <Description>Mueh'zala has been around for many generations, how many exactly we cannot say. His domain is a land of mystery to us all. 

But we are a people of probabilities and margins. A creature of that age, with such power, and the many ancient souls within his domain, has a great chance to be in possession of a relic of unfathomable rarity.

&lt;The light around Ta'lan's head flares brightly for a moment. He seems... excited?&gt;

Slay the foolish creature, bring me his secrets, I will reward you handsomely!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain a Strange Ritual Mask from Mueh'zala in De Other Side.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This mask is similar in features to some of the automaton parts we have found in our time here in the Shadowlands. Perhaps it belonged to an ancient civilization? The information we have is scattered and incomplete.

Any further pieces you may find of this sort will help us unravel these great mysteries. There seems to be a greater design to this place than we can see, yet so much of it eludes us.

I will take it off of your hands, in exchange you make take one of our most valuable pieces.</RewardText>
