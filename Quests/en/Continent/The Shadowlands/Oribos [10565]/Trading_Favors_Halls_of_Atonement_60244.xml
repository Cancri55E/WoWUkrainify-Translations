  <Title>Trading Favors: Halls of Atonement</Title>
  <Description>The mechanisms by which each land of the Shadowlands operates are quite intriguing. Yet, I have always held a particular fascination with the venthyr of Revendreth.

How they siphon souls of their sins, storing them in strange stones, and dredge up minions from the muck that surrounds them -- it is all quite novel.

They keep their secrets close at hand, however, and will not willingly part with information. I offer trades for any of their tomes you might come into possession of.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Tome of Dredger Alchemy from Lord Chamberlain in the Halls of Atonement.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>A tome from Revendreth? Yes, let me see.

It chronicles the alchemical formulae necessary to form the dredger pools, and various recipes for forming and utilizing the little creatures. They are quite a curiosity, as much a minion as a reagent.

I will gladly take this off of your hands in exchange for a trade. Here, choose.</RewardText>
