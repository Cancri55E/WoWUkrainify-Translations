  <Title>Link to the Maw</Title>
  <Description>The Fatescribe is certain that a second waystone has emerged in the Maw. It falls to you to locate it. 

I will create an anchor here in Oribos that links to your anima. Once you attune yourself to the waystone, this anchor will be bound to it.

If you are successful, the covenants will be able to send their forces inside and safely leave the Maw again.

Use what resources you have within the Maw to find this waystone.

Good luck, mortal. May the Purpose guide us all.</Description>
