  <Title>The Battle of Ardenweald</Title>
  <Description>With the betrayal of Sire Denathrius, and the absence of the Primus of Maldraxxus, we must assume that the Winter Queen is the Jailer's next target.

And we won't let anyone take her sigil!

Ardenweald has endured much, but it is a realm of great and mysterious power. Things aren't always what they seem.

We'll use this to our advantage, no matter who comes for the Queen!</Description>

But it's not over. We can't let our guard down!</RewardText>
