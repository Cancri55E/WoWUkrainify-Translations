  <Title>A Valuable Find: Sanguine Depths</Title>
  <Description>General Kaal has slain many foes, and in a bag at her side, she holds the skulls of those she considers her most precious kills. Not all of them, of course, have skulls --  it is a bag of eclectic contents.

Contained within, we have heard, is the head of one of our kind. We do not know to whom it might belong, for we do not often find ourselves running afoul of the venthyr.

Such a strange mystery must be solved. I will, of course, provide great compensation.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain an Ancient Broker Headpiece from General Kaal in the Sanguine Depths.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This... is not what I expected.

It is similar in appearance to our people, yet so very different. Are there others of our kind out there? Who are they, and where do they reside? Why have they not made contact with us? Or are they hiding themselves purposefully?

Is this a history we knew but have forgotten? I have so many questions.

I thank you for this, it is quite meaningful to us. Please, take a relic of power from the treasury.</RewardText>
