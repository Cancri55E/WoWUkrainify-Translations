  <Title>Choosing Your Purpose</Title>
  <Description>Each covenant is vital to the Shadowlands. Though they have been isolated and divided as of late, the Purpose depends on the success of their efforts.

All of the covenants must bolster their strength to face the threat of the Banished One. But your contributions cannot be divided. They must be focused upon a single path. Other mortals may make a different choice.

Speak to your potential allies. Then make your choice at the map of the Shadowlands before me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to the Covenants. Decide how your path is entwined with the Purpose.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>All is as expected. Trust always in the Arbiter's wisdom.</RewardText>
