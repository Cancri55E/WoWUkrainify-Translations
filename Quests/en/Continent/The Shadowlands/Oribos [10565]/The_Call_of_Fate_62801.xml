  <Title>The Call of Fate</Title>
  <Description>I am the Arbiter's fatescribe. It is my duty to observe the strands of destiny that the Purpose lays before us.

Fate flows through you, mortal, as you journey through the Shadowlands. And now it offers you... a choice.

Return to Oribos, $n, that I might help guide your path.

The Purpose is our way.</Description>
