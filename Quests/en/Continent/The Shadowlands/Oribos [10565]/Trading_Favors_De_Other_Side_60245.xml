  <Title>Trading Favors: De Other Side</Title>
  <Description>Mueh'zala is an ancient and primitive creature that commands a place known as De Other Side. Little is known about this land, as we are not permitted to visit. We have sent many offers of trade, yet there has never been a reply. 

A pity, as the few that have escaped Mueh'zala's clutches claim his domain to be a place of many oddities.

We would never ask you to venture into such danger. There is, however, a standing offer of trade for things procured from Mueh'zala's grasp.</Description>
