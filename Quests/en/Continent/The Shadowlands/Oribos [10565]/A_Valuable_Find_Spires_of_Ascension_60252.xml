  <Title>A Valuable Find: Spires of Ascension</Title>
  <Description>You have, no doubt, visited Bastion and seen what happens to souls that are accepted there. Their memories are extracted, viewed, and even stored in their great Temple of Wisdom.

This temple houses memories that may answer some of the greatest questions we have about our realm and the worlds beyond. It is a shame they are locked away.

We have heard that the fallen Paragon of Loyalty has interest in these memories. Any memory that would catch her attention would surely be worth trading for.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Fading Memory Glass from Devos, Paragon of Doubt in the Spires of Ascension.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This memory glass is old, very old. It may be the memory of a soul that moved on many years ago, we can never be certain. What is known is that the knowledge contained within can never be replicated, and soon, will never be seen again.

I will immediately get to work in preserving what of it I can. I must ask that you take your leave now, please choose a suitably rich reward for your efforts.</RewardText>
