  <Title>Eyes of the Wolf</Title>
  <Description>An alarming rumor has reached me, thanks to our spies.

The Forsaken are mustering in Tirisfal Glades. For what purpose, I do not know. Notably, Calia Menethil has gone there as well.

We must know more of what they are up to, now that the accursed Banshee Queen no longer unites them.

Go, don a disguise and see what you can discover. Observe everything. And if there is opportunity to gain their trust and learn more, do as they ask.

I eagerly await your report.</Description>
