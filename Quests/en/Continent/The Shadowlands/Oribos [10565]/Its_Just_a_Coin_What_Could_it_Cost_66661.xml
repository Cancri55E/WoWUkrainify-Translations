  <Title>It's Just a Coin, What Could it Cost?</Title>
  <Description>&lt;This curious object provides more questions than answers. How did you come to have it? What is it used for? Is it dangerous?&gt;

&lt;If the Eternal City does not hold answers for you, then surely the Brokers who trade there will.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Seek out a Broker in Oribos for information.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That coin... no one in Oribos will take its kind, and I doubt you'd survive the trip to the market that could. If I may be so bold, perhaps my associates and I could provide assistance?</RewardText>
