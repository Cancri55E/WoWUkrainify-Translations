  <Title>Trading Favors: Theater of Pain</Title>
  <Description>Grandmaster Vole runs the arena in Maldraxxus, where the champions of each of the houses compete for glory. Naturally, prizes are often awarded to the victors. 

Those of our kind do not often participate in such battles. To find such a prize for sale by one of us would be quite unusual indeed.

I trust I need say no more? Let us keep this transaction between us, and I will be happy to part with some valuable goods.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain a Champion's Coin from Mordretha in the Theater of Pain.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Quite interesting, these coins are only granted to champions of the Maldraxxus arena after a certain amount of time in service. Purely ceremonial, they are worthless to most, but priceless to those that value ceremony. 

You may take something with you in compensation.</RewardText>
