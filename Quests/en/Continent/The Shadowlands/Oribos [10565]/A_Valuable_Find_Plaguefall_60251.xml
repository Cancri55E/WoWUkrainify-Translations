  <Title>A Valuable Find: Plaguefall</Title>
  <Description>Life in Maldraxxus is one of constant warfare, the great houses in perpetual competition with one another. Every once in a great while, a house lord obtains an item or piece of knowledge of such rarity that it tips the scales in their favor.

It is possible, even probable, that this was the cause of the fate that befell the House of Plagues.

I do not need to tell you how valuable such a rarity would be to us, do I?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain A Slimy Correspondence from Margrave Stradama in Plaguefall.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I can only decipher a few words of this missive, give me a moment.

It appears to be a warning from the Margrave to another lord of Maldraxxus, or perhaps another place.

I see mention of the Primus, and discussion of his fate. Or someone else's? It is hard to tell. It appears to point to a location, but I cannot understand the description of the location.

This may be more valuable than you know for the fate of the Shadowlands. Choose a reward, I will continue my work on this.</RewardText>
