  <Title>Trading Favors</Title>
  <Description>Welcome, friend. 

I can see by your garb that you must have quite a storied history. Many unique relics befitting of one that has traveled the worlds and vanquished many foes.

There are those of us that find great value in such things, and would willingly part with our own valuables for a taste of what you may find. 

Let your curiosity guide you to the dark hallway across from the cookpots in the next room. Down there, you will find answers.</Description>
