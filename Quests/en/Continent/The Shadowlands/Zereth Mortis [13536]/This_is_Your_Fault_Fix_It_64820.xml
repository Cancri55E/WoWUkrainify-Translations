  <Title>This is Your Fault, Fix It</Title>
  <Description>Provis Fauna is normally regulated by autonomous constructs, but there have been reports that they are no longer working.

According to the reports, you are the one responsible for the tampering of these nodes. Which means it is on you to fix them. Take this tuner, it should help--and once they are repaired, do not meddle with them again.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Fix $oa defense nodes.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>With the defenses working again, hopefully the Mawsworn presence diminishes.</RewardText>
