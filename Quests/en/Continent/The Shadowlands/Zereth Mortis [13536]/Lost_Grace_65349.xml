  <Description>The waters of the Wellspring no longer flow.

The designs of the First Ones have never before failed us. The pilgrims are beginning to wonder... are the First Ones displeased?

Certainly they may question, but MY faith remains steadfast. And as I expected, it seems the First Ones have sent us a solution. 

You, of course. 

Ancient research and texts indicate that the source of the wellspring is in an underground temple in Provis Esper. Go, I have faith that you will restore the Wellspring.</Description>
