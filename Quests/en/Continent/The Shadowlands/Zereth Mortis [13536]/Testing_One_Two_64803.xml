  <Description>The creatures of Zereth Mortis have existed here since well before I created Domination.

We have seen the effects that Zovaal's forces have had on them, but I believe there is more to be learned.

Use the helm on the denizens of Zereth Mortis and see what you can uncover about a natural resistance.</Description>

  <RewardText>The more advanced creatures resist Domination for longer?
