  <Title>Selfless Preservation</Title>
  <Description>The automa were once abundant here, singing, constructing various things, carrying out the purpose of the First Ones. Then, invaders from the Maw slaughtered them all.

The last automa to fall were protecting something important in a nearby structure. 

I witnessed one of the cursed Mawsworn steal a device by the door. The Elders say we should not meddle with artifacts, but would it be a transgression to recover what was stolen?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover the Stolen Artifact in the Arrangement Index and restore it to its rightful place.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This automa still lives! But it is so weak.</RewardText>
