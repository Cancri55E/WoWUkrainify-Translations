  <Title>Enlightened Exodus</Title>
  <Description>Hello, my friend!

An expedition of Cartel Al was sent in search of this place long ago, and was believed lost. I entered Zereth Mortis in hopes of saving my splintered cartel from the dangers of the Maw that have preceded me.

At last, I have found my old friend! And yet, she refuses to return to safety.

Perhaps others can be convinced. Will you try?</Description>
