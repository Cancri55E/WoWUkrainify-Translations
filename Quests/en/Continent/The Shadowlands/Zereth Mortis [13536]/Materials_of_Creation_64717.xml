  <Title>Materials of Creation</Title>
  <Description>The large metal spheres that litter the landscape of Zereth Mortis are spent forges, discarded during the creation process.

The spheres near the Forge of Afterlives contain trace amounts of materials unique to that location.

I have modified my Forge-Tap to harvest those materials.  Use it near the forges I have identified. The rare Eidolic Fragments have the greatest chance to be found on the largest of Progenitor Forges.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Eidolic Fragments and $2oa Minor Enigmet.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I shall make use of these immediately. These will help Saezurah and the automa resist the effects of the domination magic.</RewardText>
