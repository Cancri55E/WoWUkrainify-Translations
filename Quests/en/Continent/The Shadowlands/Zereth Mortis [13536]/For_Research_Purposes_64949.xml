  <Description>I have taken pains not to disturb the automa during my time in Zereth Mortis, and so far they have paid little attention to me.

It seems recent events have changed that.

Again, let me be clear that I have no wish to harm the creations of the First Ones. But if, in the course of your efforts, conflict with the automa becomes inevitable, we must ensure that some good can come of it.

If I can examine fragments of fallen automa, it may provide knowledge to use against the Mawsworn.

Go carefully.</Description>
