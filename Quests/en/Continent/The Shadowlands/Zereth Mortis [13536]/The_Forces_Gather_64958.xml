  <Title>The Forces Gather</Title>
  <Description>I am relieved that you survived the passage to Zereth Mortis. From what I've overheard of Pelagos's conversation with Kleia, it sounds like you had an incredible journey.

These Enlightened brokers could make valuable allies. Their knowledge of the automa and the land itself should help us against the Jailer.

Our forces are gathered and ready to follow you to Zereth Mortis.

The final battle lies before us, $p.</Description>
