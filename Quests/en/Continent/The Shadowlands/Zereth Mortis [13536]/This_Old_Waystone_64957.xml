  <Title>This Old Waystone</Title>
  <Description>The Jailer has withdrawn his forces. I should be relieved, but I fear this means he has found a way into the Sepulcher.

&lt;Elder Ara trembles.&gt;

Despite Elder Kreth's doubts, you have proven to be an ally. Something we need more of.

When our expedition arrived in Zereth Mortis, we discovered a dormant waystone. If you are indeed a Maw Walker, then the prophecies tell us that you will be able to activate it.

If your allies can save this sacred place, then the path to them must be opened.
