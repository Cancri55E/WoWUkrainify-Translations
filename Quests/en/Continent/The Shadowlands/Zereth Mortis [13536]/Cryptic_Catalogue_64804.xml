  <Title>Cryptic Catalogue</Title>
  <Description>This area is a repository of various texts. Hmmm? What do they say? I have no idea!

I have dedicated myself to their catalogue and organization. This is more important than ever, with invaders destroying the balance in Zereth Mortis! We must preserve what we have found so far.

You can help. Go into the glade and memorize the phrases there, then meet me down in the grotto. There is something in it that might help you test that helm of yours further.</Description>
