  <Title>Security Check</Title>
  <Description>I do not understand--these are my brethren! How can they be so careless, so unconcerned with both greedy cartels and the Mawsworn at their doorstep?

Their protective technology is antiquated. It will not keep danger out. If I cannot persuade them to leave, I can at least ensure they are safe where they insist on staying.

I do not want to lose my friends again.

There should be four hidden conduits around the edge of the shield. Take this kit. It will allow you to inspect and repair them, if needed.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Investigate the Shield Conduits around Haven.</LogDescription>
