  <Title>Hello, Darkness</Title>
  <Description>I created Domination as a tool to punish Zovaal.

My anger informed that creation, and now we pay the price for my hubris. Even Eternal Ones err on occasion.

But we are not without hope.

Take the half of the broken Helm of Domination, and test it upon one of your own. If it retains enough power, it can then be used to test it elsewhere in Zereth Mortis.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Test the broken Helm of Domination on Darion Mograine.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Even those who overcame Domination are not entirely immune to it now.

But there may be something buried in that history that can aid us. 

I will think on this.

For now, focus your efforts on the creatures of Zereth Mortis. See what makes them more resistant.</RewardText>
