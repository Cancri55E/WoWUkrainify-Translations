  <Title>Not Safe for Work</Title>
  <Description>Rana's discovery of Progenitor relics at the Ageless Shards has created quite a stir among the Enlightened. These relics predate our earlier discoveries, and through them we may gain a deeper understanding of the workings of Zereth Mortis.

Rana is collecting the relics, but I fear she is in danger. Agents of Cartel Xy have been spotted in the area, and will likely attempt to steal the relics.

Please travel to the Ageless Shards, and help Rana collect the relics.</Description>
