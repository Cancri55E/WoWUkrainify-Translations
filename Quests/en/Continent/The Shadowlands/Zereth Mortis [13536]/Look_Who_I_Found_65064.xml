  <Description>Behold this magnificent creature!

Siloh says we have no resources for another of my "abnormal pets."

But we may be able to alter E'rnee so that I can keep him. Strange interactions occur between creatures and this environment. Perhaps we can make him smaller.

I know a spot where we can conduct our research. There are flowers nearby called chromatic rosids that might trigger a reaction. Why don't you collect some on the way?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve $2oa Chromatic Rosids near Dimensional Falls.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Perhaps we should do some experiments with other subjects before trying things out on E'rnee.</RewardText>
