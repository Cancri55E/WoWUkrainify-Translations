  <Title>Give Me A Hand</Title>
  <Description>To drive the Jailer from Zereth Mortis, we must direct all our resources against the enemy.

An object of potential power lies in a nearby repository, but the chamber's defenses respond only to automa. I would never harm their kind, but I have encountered one that no longer functions.

If you extract its hand, we could use the inert appendage to gain access to the repository.

I find such use of the First Ones' creations unsavory, but we cannot abide the presence of Mawsworn in this realm.</Description>
