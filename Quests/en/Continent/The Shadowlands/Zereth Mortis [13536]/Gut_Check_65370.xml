  <Title>Gut Check</Title>
  <Description>The crescendal is a powerful tool created by automa. They are given to jiro when work is hard or important. When the devourers attacked, crescendals were likely... eaten.

Crescendals are strong. They do not easily damage. Check the stomachs of bigger devourers. Perhaps find one intact?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect a Crescendal from an Insatiable Breaker or a Voracious Stalker at the Terrace of Formation.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;The jiro looks over the guts-spattered device.&gt;

Not ideal. But mostly intact... it will need cleaning.</RewardText>
