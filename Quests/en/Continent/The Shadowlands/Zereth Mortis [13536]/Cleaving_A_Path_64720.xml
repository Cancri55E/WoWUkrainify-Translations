  <Title>Cleaving A Path</Title>
  <Description>Maw Walker! My scouts report that the Mawsworn have dominated two automa Oracles to aid them in battle. These Oracles will most certainly predict our strategy and our ultimate goal, if given the chance.  

We need to eliminate both Oracles before we enter the Crypts. With them out of the way, the Mawsworn troops won't know what we're doing until we're finished with it.

Take Emeni with you. She's eager for battle.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Oracle Zoketh and Oracle Voraxxi.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Perfectly executed, $n. The loss of those Oracles should keep the Mawsworn in the dark.</RewardText>
