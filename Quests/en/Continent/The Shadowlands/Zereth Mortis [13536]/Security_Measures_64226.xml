  <Description>It seems the hidden traps I placed around the grotto are not as effective as I would like, considering your presence in my home. 

However, they are still useful in preventing the majority of unwanted attention. 

Since you so kindly brought assassins to me, I cannot reset the traps myself. 

So you will need to do it for me. I will stay here to guard both myself and my precious research. Use this Sensory Synchronizer I placed nearby to show you which traps need to be reset.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Sensory Synchronizer, then reset $2oa Triggered Traps near Exile's Hollow.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Good. That should shield us from notice for a while.</RewardText>
