  <Title>The Not-Scientific Method</Title>
  <Description>The language of the First Ones is not static like most others. It evolves.

Creatures like the sentries are more advanced than your average poultrid, obviously. Their more complex thought processes give them an innate resistance to the invaders' overriding magic. 

But you should not take my word for it. We can actually test this! 

In the grotto there is a librarian. Take those phrases you memorized and infuse them into it. Then try out your helm.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Test the Broken Helm on an activated Lexicon Librarian and observe the results.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You see! It took far longer for Domination to overtake the librarian's native purposing.

Of course it did fail in the end, but I would call that a success for your particular interest.

Do not worry, another automa will take that one's place. There must always be a librarian.</RewardText>
