  <Title>A Hasty Voyage</Title>
  <Description>The path to Zereth Mortis is open.

We must part ways here. The Eternal Ones are forbidden from returning to the place of our creation. Zovaal has defied the most sacred laws of the Progenitors.

You must undertake this journey alone.

Go. Find a foothold in Zereth Mortis so that we can send the covenant forces through.

Then we will pursue the Jailer and end his madness.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Begin your journey to Zereth Mortis by mounting the anima wyrm.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This... certainly is not Oribos.</RewardText>
