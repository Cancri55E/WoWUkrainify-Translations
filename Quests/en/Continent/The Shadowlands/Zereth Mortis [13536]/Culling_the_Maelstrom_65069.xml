  <Title>Culling the Maelstrom</Title>
  <Description>Those little E'rnee duplicates were unfriendly.

Some effect of the Falls created them. They are not stable. Did you see where they went? 

They must be culled before they harm the rest of the wildlife. You take care of that while I collect another sample from the Falls.</Description>
