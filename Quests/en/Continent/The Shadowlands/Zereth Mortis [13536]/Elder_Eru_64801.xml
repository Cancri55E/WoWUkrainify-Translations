  <Title>Elder Eru</Title>
  <Description>Since we have earned the trust of the Enlightened, I have learned more about their explorations into Zereth Mortis.

They know more than they are willing to tell, but often do not act on that knowledge. Perhaps where they observe, we can be a catalyst for action.

In a secluded corner called the Lexical Glade, there is an elder named Eru. She may be able to give us insight on how we might use the language of the First Ones.

Seek her out, and see if she will help us.</Description>
