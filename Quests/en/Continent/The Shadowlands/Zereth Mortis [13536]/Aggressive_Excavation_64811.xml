  <Title>Aggressive Excavation</Title>
  <Description>Elder Eru said that we could find the most complex examples of the First Ones' language out here. 

We'll need to fight our way to the vaults, and then infuse the helm once we find those phrases.

I am ready when you are.</Description>

  <RewardText>We've done it. The broken half of the helm is infused with the most advanced pieces of the First Ones' power that we could readily find.

We are so close to success.</RewardText>
