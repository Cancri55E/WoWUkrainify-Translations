  <Title>The Way Forward</Title>
  <Description>I see you have a new friend, Maw Walker!

With Pocopoc at your side, I wonder what else you will discover about Zereth Mortis? The secrets we uncover here will be of great help against the Jailer. Perhaps they can teach us how to awaken this oracle.

Highlord Bolvar will surely want to hear of them.

Please go to Haven and inform him. There is a transporter just outside the cave you may want to use. 

I will remain here and keep watch over the oracle.</Description>
