  <Description>Those guardian automa will shoot down anything that attempts to reach the Creation Catalyst.

May I suggest fighting fire with fire? Or rather, fighting the creations of the First Ones with the creation energy of the First Ones?

I have had little time to adequately test my theory, but this potion should provide the boost you need to destroy them... ideally without dying from exposure to the creation energy in the process.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Drink Feroz's solution and destroy the automa of the Catalyst Gardens.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It was quite poetic, I think, using their own growth energy against them.</RewardText>
