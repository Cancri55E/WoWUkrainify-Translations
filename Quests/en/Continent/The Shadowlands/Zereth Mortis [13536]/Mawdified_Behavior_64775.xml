  <Description>There is a devourer in the cave. It creates a rift. This should not be possible in Zereth Mortis.

Enter the cave and destroy the devourer. Search for clues. See how it can open a rift.

Be careful. This one is different from others. It has absorbed the magic of the First Ones. This has never happened before. Be ready for anything.

I will stay here and protect the jiro.</Description>
