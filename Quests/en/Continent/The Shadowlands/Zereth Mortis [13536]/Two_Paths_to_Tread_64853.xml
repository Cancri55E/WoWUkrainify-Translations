  <Description>Did that answer your question?

Oh, you wanted a way to completely resist Domination magic? That I'm afraid I do not know. The First Ones' language will only delay the inevitable.

What I can tell you is that if you want to find more deliciously complex phrases of the First Ones' language, you should go to the Endless Sands and search the vaults.

I wish I could go myself, but it has been overrun by those nasty Mawsworn.

Good luck with the rest of your studies!</Description>

  <RewardText>This Elder has given us an important answer to this puzzle. But now we must act on the information. Though, doing so will be difficult.

First we must infuse the helm with those indecipherable phrases from the First Ones that are in the Endless Sands.

But that will not be enough on its own. We will need more. Let me prepare, while you acquire what we need. I will send word for you after.</RewardText>
