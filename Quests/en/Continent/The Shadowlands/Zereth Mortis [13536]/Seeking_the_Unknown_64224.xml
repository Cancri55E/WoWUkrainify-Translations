  <Description>If the Elders will not assist us, we must find someone who will. 

That other Enlightened, Firim... he was much more interested in the automa. 

He said he was estranged from his kin. Someone in Haven must know something about him. 

Look around the camp for clues about Firim's whereabouts. I will try again to convince the Elders to talk.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search Haven for information about Firim.</LogDescription>
