  <Title>Following the Leader</Title>
  <Description>We sealed the door to the Slumbering Vault when we first arrived. It is a sanctum, a cradle of all that is precious here. The power that sleeps within should not be touched by us. 

If the Xy leader made it past the shields while we were distracted by the beauty of this place, I shudder to think of what they have already disturbed.

Hurry! We must go to the Slumbering Vault and ensure its safety.</Description>
