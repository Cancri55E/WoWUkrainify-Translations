  <Title>Oppress and Destroy</Title>
  <Description>What we seek is in the vaults of the Endless Sands. To reach them will require strength and numbers.

Together we will destroy the Mawsworn. 

I look forward to taking the fight directly to them.

Remember, they will be vulnerable to the broken shard from the Helm of Domination.</Description>

Let us hope that this is last time we see the helm used as a weapon.</RewardText>
