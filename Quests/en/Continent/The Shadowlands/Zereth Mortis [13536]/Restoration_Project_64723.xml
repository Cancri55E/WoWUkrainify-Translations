  <Title>Restoration Project</Title>
  <Description>Without an Arbiter, the very purpose of the Shadowlands has been compromised. Souls flood the Maw with no direction.

As Saezurah noted, Zereth Mortis would ordinarily craft a new being to take the Arbiter's place. I suspect the Jailer's forces have disrupted the land to the point where this is no longer possible.

It is time to take action ourselves, and bring stability again to the Shadowlands! Speak to Saezurah, and see where we must begin.</Description>
