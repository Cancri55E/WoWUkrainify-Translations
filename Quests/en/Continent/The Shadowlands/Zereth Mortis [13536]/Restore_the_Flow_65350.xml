  <Title>Restore the Flow</Title>
  <Description>Look! Devourers have penetrated the temple's defenses. Those ravenous menaces feed on any energy that they can find. They must have been drawn to the wellspring's power.

With that kind of interference, no wonder the waters have been stalled!

The solution must be inside Locrian Esper. Once there, see if you can find a way to reverse the damage that has been done.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find a way to restore Locrian Esper.</LogDescription>
