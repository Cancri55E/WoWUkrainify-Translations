  <Title>A Long Walk</Title>
  <Description>The Arbiter awaits us. Though few are allowed within the Crucible, several who hail from Azeroth have been granted permission to bear witness as he passes judgment on Sylvanas.

Yet we are far from the only ones affected by all the carnage Sylvanas has wrought. Her actions have brought pain and suffering to a great many.

Screaming back at the Banshee as she passes might be their only chance to speak their mind. Let them be heard.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Uther in Oribos to escort Sylvanas to the Enclave, then speak to Tal-Inara to be brought to the Crucible.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Meet with Pelagos in the Crucible of Oribos.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Thank you for joining us, my friend. 

I felt it important that you be here to witness this moment.</RewardText>
