  <Description>We have obtained a wealth of information from relics discovered at the Ageless Shards. 

The Mawsworn are aware of our discoveries, and are trying to stop us. They have placed traps around the area to block access to the relics. 

We cannot allow the Jailer to cut off our access to those relics.

Please eliminate this Mawsworn threat, and recover as many relics as possible.</Description>
