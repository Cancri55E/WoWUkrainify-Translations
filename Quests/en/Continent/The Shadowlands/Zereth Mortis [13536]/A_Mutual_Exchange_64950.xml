  <Title>A Mutual Exchange</Title>
  <Description>It seems the other automa did not appreciate our appropriation of their colleague's hand. They have become hostile.

Unfortunate, but we cannot allow this to impede our progress.

The automa's hand should activate a console within the Genesis Repository. I believe it holds an object of great potential.

After you acquire it, I will guide you to a place that may provide a means to reach the allies you left behind.

Do we have an accord?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Automa Hand to activate an Automa Console and obtain the Repository Treasure.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Firim snatches the core from your hands.&gt;

Intriguing. I have examined many automa cores, but this one glows with an energy unlike any I have seen before.</RewardText>
