  <Title>Call of the Primus</Title>
  <Description>Though we fought to stop the Jailer in the Sanctum of Domination, we failed. He enveloped Oribos in the Maw, struck down the Arbiter, and opened the way to Zereth Mortis. 

The time has come to follow him. 

Within the Arbiter's Chamber, we will forge our own path.

Hurry, Maw Walker. The fate of the Shadowlands, and all the realms beyond, is at stake.</Description>
