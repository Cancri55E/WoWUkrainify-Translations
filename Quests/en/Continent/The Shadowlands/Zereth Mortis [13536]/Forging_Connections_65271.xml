  <Description>Firim described these Enlightened brokers unfavorably. Then again, he does seem a bit... eccentric.

Regardless, if we are to restore contact with our comrades in Oribos and defeat the Jailer, we will need allies in Zereth Mortis.

The Mawsworn look to be gathering outside the gates of Haven. We must not let any more innocents fall prey to the Jailer's villainy.

Hopefully the Enlightened will welcome our aid. After you, my friend.</Description>
