  <Title>Jiro to Hero</Title>
  <Description>I have spoken to other jiro. Our orb can create a dampening field. It should close the rifts and stop new ones from forming.

It must be done where the Maw magic is strongest. Between the giant chains. The power released by the orb will draw devourers. You and I must defend the orb until the field is set.

I will escort the others. Meet us at the rift when you are ready.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defend the jiro from devourers until they enact the dampening field.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak to Hanoa the Exile outside Zovaal's Grasp.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Devourers have been repelled. For now. But they will return.

One day, we will remove them forever. I will stay to defend the jiro until then.

This could not have been done without you. You have my deepest gratitude.</RewardText>
