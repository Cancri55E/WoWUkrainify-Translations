  <Description>This automa has been hiding here! I suspect it will not be receptive to our help.

I am hesitant to suggest this, but if the servitor were to associate you with this facility, it might be more amenable. 

If you have the means, copy the glyphs inscribed on similar automa outside. Those that the Maw have touched will be tainted, but I saw from my vantage point a few fallen automa in the sands with untarnished glyphs.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain glyphs from $1oa Depleted Servitors around the Arrangement Index.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I hope this will encourage our friend here to view us as an ally. First Ones forgive us.</RewardText>
