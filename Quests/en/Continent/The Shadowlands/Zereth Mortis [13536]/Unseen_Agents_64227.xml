  <Title>Unseen Agents</Title>
  <Description>Ever since you opened the way from Oribos, certain cartels have taken the opportunity to come after me and my work in a rather... lethal fashion. They know how important my research is to everything. 

More assassins are sure to follow, what with you blazing a clear path right to me! 

I cannot get them all. You need to fix this and help protect my secrets. 

Take care of them for me.</Description>
