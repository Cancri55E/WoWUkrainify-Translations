  <Title>The Burrowed Bufonid</Title>
  <Description>Have you stopped to watch the bufonids?

A lovely one lurks underwater. Still, patient, unmoving. Wise Bud takes after him. They are much alike. I sense Bud desires to see this large bufonid up close. 

Perhaps the creature can be lured out with some honey from the vespoids here in Zereth Mortis. Would you please gather some?</Description>
