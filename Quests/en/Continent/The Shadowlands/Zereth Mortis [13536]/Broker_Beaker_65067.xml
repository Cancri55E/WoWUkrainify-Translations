  <Title>Broker Beaker</Title>
  <Description>I was running some experiments of my own before you got here.

Those tests... did not go too well. It turns out some environmental components can aggravate the creatures, turning even the most docile into predators.

I dropped my component container and ran, and I cannot recall where I left it.

The beaker must be somewhere among the herd of carnivorous cervids. If these flowers do not work, we will need that container for our next round of tests.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve the Component Beaker from Carnivorous Cervids near Dimensional Falls.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ah. This will certainly be useful.</RewardText>
