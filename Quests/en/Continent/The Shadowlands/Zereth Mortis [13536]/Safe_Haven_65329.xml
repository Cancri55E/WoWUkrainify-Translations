  <RewardText>A new Arbiter has been established? This is excellent news, $n, and a massive step towards restoring balance to the Shadowlands. Your efforts here will not be forgotten. 

However, it is still only one step towards our goal. We must continue to strengthen our position in Zereth Mortis, and drive the Jailer's forces out.
