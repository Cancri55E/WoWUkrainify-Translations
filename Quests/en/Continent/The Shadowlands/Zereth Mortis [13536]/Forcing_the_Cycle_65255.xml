  <Title>Forcing the Cycle</Title>
  <Description>The forces of Zovaal have been spreading their malign influence into the natural life within Provis Fauna. With the rate of their corruption, attempting to cleanse them one by one would be ill advised.

Instead, we can just return their energies into the systems of Zereth Mortis to be used to create new fauna. Use this orb, let it absorb their energy as they die, and then cleanse it once it has been charged.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Charge and cleanse the Progenitor orb.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Their energy will serve the cycle.</RewardText>
