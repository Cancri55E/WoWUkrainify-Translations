  <Title>The Road to Haven</Title>
  <Description>I did not expect to encounter a living mortal and a kyrian this day, but your assistance has been valuable.

Before I begin my studies of this automa core, I will guide you to Haven, the settlement founded by my expedition upon our arrival.

Though my colleagues saw fit to exile me for challenging their "Enlightened" dogma, I have no wish to see Haven wiped from existence by the Jailer.

Aid them and they may assist your efforts to return to your allies. We brokers are nothing if not transactional.</Description>

  <RewardText>I can go no further.

My former colleagues and I have... philosophical differences.</RewardText>
