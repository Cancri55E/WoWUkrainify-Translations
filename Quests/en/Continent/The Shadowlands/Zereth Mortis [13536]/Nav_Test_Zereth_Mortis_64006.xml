  <Title>Nav Test: Zereth Mortis</Title>
  <Description>This quest will take you through a likely flow for the 9.2 Main Line questing. We don't have a finalized pitch for the 9.2 Main Line yet, so this is just a rough idea of how the POIs might be used.

This test is built to be Beastmaster and Godmode friendly, so feel free to use cheats.

Useful cheats:
92BrokerTown - Return to hub
92NavTest - Restart the Nav Test (Must abandon first)</Description>
