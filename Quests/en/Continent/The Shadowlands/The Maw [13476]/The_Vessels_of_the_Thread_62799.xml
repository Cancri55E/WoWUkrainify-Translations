  <Title>The Vessels of the Thread</Title>
  <Description>You have the bearing of one familiar with the art of thread work. But perhaps you have more to learn.

Vessels that hold the power of the runes can be crafted by a hand such as yours. But this I cannot teach you.

Hmm, there is a way. I will entrust you with a memory of my recipes for the vessels. Take it to a master of your craft and they will show you the way.

What's that? Do not worry. It is merely an echo of my memory. What you restored to me remains intact.</Description>
