  <Title>Setting the Ground Rules</Title>
  <Description>Back to rescue more souls? How intrepid.

Though I must say, your earlier escapade has drawn the Jailer's attention... and his ire. After all, none have successfully eluded him before. 

Except for me.

Now his forces are on high alert, hunting down any errant souls that the fabled Maw Walker may try to steal from him.

It has made things quite... inconvenient for me. If you and I are going to work together, we need to set a few ground rules.

And you must be properly equipped.</Description>

Now, let us get to business.</RewardText>
