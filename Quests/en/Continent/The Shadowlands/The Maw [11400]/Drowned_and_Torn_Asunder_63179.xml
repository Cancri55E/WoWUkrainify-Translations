  <Description>Maw Walker! I am relieved to see you in this place.

A dark sect of kyrian who have allied themselves with the Maw stole my brothers and sisters from their posts in Bastion. They turned us over to a foul sea witch, the likes of which I've never seen.

This... Helya, I believe they called her... seems determined to break us so that we might also join her ranks.

Please, if you can, save my brethren.</Description>

  <RewardText>We are in your debt, Maw Walker.

I don't know if we will ever escape this place, but you have at least bought us a chance to strike back at our foes.</RewardText>
