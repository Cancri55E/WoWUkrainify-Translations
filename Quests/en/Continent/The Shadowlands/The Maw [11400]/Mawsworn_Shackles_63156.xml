  <Title>Mawsworn Shackles</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The shackles are part tangible, part ethereal. They scream into your mind when held. 

Just the sort of thing Ve'nari might be looking for.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Mawsworn Shackles to Ve'nari at Ve'nari's Refuge.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Ve'nari snatches the shackles from your hands.&gt;

Rather dangerous for a mortal such as yourself to be carrying these around.

&lt;Ve'nari lifts and lowers the shackles slowly, as if to determine the weight.&gt;

Though I must admit... these could prove useful.</RewardText>
