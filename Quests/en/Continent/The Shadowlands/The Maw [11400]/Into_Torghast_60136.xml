  <Title>Into Torghast</Title>
  <Description>The bond to your covenant is growing stronger, $n. Good. The power lies within you to venture into Torghast and rescue our allies.

You saw Baine Bloodhoof while assisting the broker in the Maw. Perhaps this Ve'nari knows a way to breach the Jailer's tower and find the chieftain.

When I peered into Torghast once before, you stood at my side. I believe that connection will allow me to see through your eyes as you navigate its torments.

Seek out Ve'nari and request her aid, Maw Walker.</Description>
