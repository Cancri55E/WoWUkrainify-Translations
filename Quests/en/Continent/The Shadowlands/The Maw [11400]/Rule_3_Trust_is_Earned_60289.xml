  <Title>Rule 3: Trust is Earned</Title>
  <Description>Before you leave this cursed realm, there is one final task you must complete for me.

The Mawsworn regularly transfer souls to various blocks of Torghast from many different areas in the Maw.

I happen to know of one such area. Place this beacon there so I may be informed when the next transfer happens.

And if you are seen by the enemy... well, you are known for your prowess in combat, yes?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place a Signaling Beacon in Cocyrus.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>One of your associates was taken into Torghast? 

It sounds as if he put up quite the fight. Perhaps he could also prove useful... if he were to be rescued.</RewardText>
