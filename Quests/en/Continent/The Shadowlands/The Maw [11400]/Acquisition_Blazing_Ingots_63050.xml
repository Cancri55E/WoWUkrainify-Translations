  <Title>Acquisition: Blazing Ingots</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The runesmiths have imbued this ingot with an enchantment that causes it to burn with inextinguishable flames. 

It is likely that this metal is used to empower the Mawsworn protectors of Zovaal's Cauldron. 

Bringing some samples of this ore to Ve'nari could aid her attempts at unlocking the Jailer's secrets.&gt;</Description>

  <RewardText>Intriguing. I had often wondered what differentiated the Cauldron's protectors from the rest of the Mawsworn.
