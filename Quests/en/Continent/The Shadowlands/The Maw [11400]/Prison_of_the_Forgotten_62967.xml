  <Title>Prison of the Forgotten</Title>
  <Description>I discovered an interesting item off the Warden you killed in the tower. 

Best not to ask how I know what you do and where you do it within the tower. Let's just say, I have my ways.

But this key could lead to something interesting within Torghast. Or something horrible. Most likely horrible.

You ought to explore a bit and see what it unlocks.</Description>
