  <Title>Torment Chamber: Thrall</Title>
  <Description>Using the totem you recovered, I will alter the Attuned Shard to guide you to Thrall's location.

&lt;Bolvar hands you the crystalline object.&gt;

Take care. You know the torments Baine and Lady Proudmoore endured in that accursed place. Thrall's confinement will be no less harrowing.

Beware. The deeper you journey into the Tower of the Damned, the closer you get to the Jailer himself.

Free Thrall, $n... before all hope is lost.</Description>
