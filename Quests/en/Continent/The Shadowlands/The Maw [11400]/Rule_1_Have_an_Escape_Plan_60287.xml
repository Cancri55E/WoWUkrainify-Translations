  <Title>Rule 1: Have an Escape Plan</Title>
  <Description>Many doomed souls suffer within the Maw. You must be careful if you do not wish to join them.

Your Soulkeeper can hold a small number of souls until you return to your covenant. But that will be of little benefit if you do not survive this place yourself.

There is a substance, stygia, that is found on some creatures within the Maw. The stronger the soul, the more stygia they have.

Collect some of it for me and I can fashion it into many things you will find quite useful.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rescue 5 souls and retrieve $2oa Stygia. 

Stronger enemies will have a higher chance to drop large amounts of Stygia. 

Use the Stygia to purchase a Cypher of Relocation from Ve'nari.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You seem to have a knack for drawing the Jailer's attention.

This changes the terms of our arrangement.</RewardText>
