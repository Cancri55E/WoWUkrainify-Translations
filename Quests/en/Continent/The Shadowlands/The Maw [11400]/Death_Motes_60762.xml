  <Title>Death Motes</Title>
  <Description>I have a task for you, Maw Walker.

Souls deemed suitable for service among the Mawsworn are broken down to their barest essence. The resulting creature forms a black shade, devoid of all individual will.

It is a tragic end.

I wish to better understand this process--what is it about a soul that causes this transformation?

Fragments of broken souls rain down across Ruin's Cradle. Bring me some of them, so that I might learn more about our common adversaries.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Death Motes from Ruin's Cradle in The Maw.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It is perhaps... ethically questionable to benefit from these motes, given their source. 

But such knowledge may prove vital in defeating our enemies.</RewardText>
