  <Title>Torment Chamber: Jaina</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Bolvar studies the objects you acquired from the brokers in Torghast.&gt;

I sense Lady Proudmoore's magic upon this debris. And these notes describe methods to contain her power.

&lt;The Highlord focuses on the items, peering into the darkness.&gt;

By the Light! They are tormenting her with white-hot fires. Though her will is strong, there is only so much any mortal can endure.

I will modify Ve'nari's Attuned Shard using the items you returned.

You must find her, $p. Before it is too late.</Description>
