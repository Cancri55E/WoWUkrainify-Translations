  <Title>The Search for Baine</Title>
  <Description>I dare not step inside that accursed tower myself, of course.

While I cannot tell you exactly where your comrade is being held, I offer a gift to assist you.

Use it inside Torghast. It should take you somewhere near your missing ally. Baine Bloodhoof was his name, yes?

Either that, or you'll end up trapped within the tower's ever-shifting halls for all eternity.

But those are the risks one must take, I suppose. Best of luck!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Enter Torghast and search for Baine.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return with Baine to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Oribos</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Finding Baine was no easy feat. But you braved the horrors of that tower and succeeded.

Well done.

But I fear your work is only just beginning.</RewardText>
