  <Title>Words of Warding</Title>
  <Description>The towering citadel in the distance is protected by perilous walls, but its greatest dangers cannot be seen with mortal eyes.

The Mawsworn have placed invisible runes of warding throughout Perdition Hold. These traps have caught many intruders unaware.

The runes can be dispelled, but only if you can see them. I believe one of their soulcloaks should give you the sight you require.

Good luck.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Steal an Assassin's Soulcloak and dispel $2oa Runes of Warding within Perdition Hold in The Maw.
