  <Title>Rule 7: Betrayal is Inevitable</Title>
  <Description>Our arrangement has been quite lucrative. Reliable associates like yourself can be so hard to find.

I believe I can entrust you with a task I would usually perform on my own.

While working with the tracking runes you retrieved for me earlier, I detected a device of broker origin nearby. It must have been brought into the Maw by the captured expedition.

Please examine it and prepare it for transport back to the refuge. I will join you shortly.

This could be a valuable discovery.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover the broker device outside of Perdition Hold.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It seems our partnership has become rather permanent. Cartel Ve will not rest until we are both eliminated.

I suppose now would be the time to share one of my most important rules with you.</RewardText>
