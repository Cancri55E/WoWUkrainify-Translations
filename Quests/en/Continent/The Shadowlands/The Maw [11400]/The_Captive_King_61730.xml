  <Title>The Captive King</Title>
  <Description>King Anduin has not been found inside Torghast. I fear we could spend eternity searching those endless corridors to no avail.

We must know what fate has befallen him. To peer into the tower represents a grave risk, yet we have little choice.

Stand with me, $n. We will use the broken Helm of Domination to see into that hellish place.

Perhaps together we can hold back the hungry darkness.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Helm of Domination to peer into Torghast.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Anduin may appear unharmed, but his soul is imperiled.

Sylvanas Windrunner cannot be allowed to carry out her plan.</RewardText>
