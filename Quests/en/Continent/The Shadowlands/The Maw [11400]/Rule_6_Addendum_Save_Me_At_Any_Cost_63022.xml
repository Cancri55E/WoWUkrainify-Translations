  <Title>Rule 6 Addendum: Save Me At Any Cost</Title>
  <Description>You! You, there! Wait!

You are the infamous Maw Walker, yes? I have heard much about you.

Please, help me! My compatriots have been drained of their essence. The Mawsworn are using it to fashion their foul runes.

One of them bound me here, and I am sure to be next on his list. You must slay him in order to free me!

I can make it worth your while. I have collected a fair amount of stygia during my time in the Maw. It is yours, all of it, if you save me!</Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>Runemaster Mavrok</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>Runemaster Mavrok is controlling the chains that bind Ve'brax. Slay him!</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Slay Runemaster Mavrok.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Not a moment too soon! Those fiends were just about to put the sword to me. 

Here, as we agreed, is your payment in stygia. 

Though truth be told, I owe you a great deal more than this. I have nothing left to offer... except for wisdom and warnings.</RewardText>
