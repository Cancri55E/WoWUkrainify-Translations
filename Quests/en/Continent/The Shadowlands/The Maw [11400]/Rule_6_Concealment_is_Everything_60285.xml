  <Title>Rule 6: Concealment is Everything</Title>
  <Description>I have made a startling discovery, $n. 

Do you recall how the captured agents of my cartel were taken to the Beastwarrens? 

The Mawsworn seem to think they possess a means of tracking me. And now, strange new runes empower the Jailer's hounds.

Clearly, we cannot have that.

This new cypher will grant you solace from the screeching in the Beastwarrens. Brave its caverns and secure those runes for inspection.

If we are to counter their effects, I must know how they work.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve $2oa Broker Hunting Runes from The Beastwarrens.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Interesting... runes that can detect brokers by using our extracted essence.

Let us hope you were able to stop any further production. I will keep these for study.

At some point, you will certainly need to walk the nightmarish plains of the Beastwarrens again. My cypher will continue to allow you to do so.</RewardText>
