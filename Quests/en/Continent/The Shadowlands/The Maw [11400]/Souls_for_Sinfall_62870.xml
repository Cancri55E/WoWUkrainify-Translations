  <Title>Souls for Sinfall</Title>
  <Description>Baine suffers within Torghast, but at least we know that he yet lives.

Rushing to his rescue would prove disastrous without a plan of attack. I will see to preparing one.

In the meantime, I suggest you bring the souls you rescued back to Sinfall. 

Denathrius's machinations have left the venthyr poorly provisioned, and Prince Renathal will require all the souls he can muster.</Description>
