  <Title>Sundered Souls</Title>
  <Description>The traps... they didn't affect us before. Too many souls... escaping. 

They... made new traps... tear apart fleeing souls...

...too late for me. Destroy... so others might escape!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy $1oa Soulrend Traps in the Tremaculum.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;With the rending traps disabled, the souls here should stand a better chance of escaping their captors.

Though they may never escape the Maw, at least they have a chance of escaping the grim fate of becoming a mindless shade.&gt;</RewardText>
