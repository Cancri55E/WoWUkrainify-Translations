  <Title>Grathalax, the Extractor</Title>
  <Description>There are many powerful lieutenants among the Mawsworn, but there is one who is particularly important to the Jailer.

His role is to make the process of anima extraction more efficient. His methods are... unkind.

I believe we would both benefit from the end of his existence.</Description>
