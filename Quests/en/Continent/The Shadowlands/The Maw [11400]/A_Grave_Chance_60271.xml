  <Title>A Grave Chance</Title>
  <Description>First you'll need a vessel to house anima and a way to expel it. I happen to possess such a device, which I'll be pleased to give to you.

For a price, of course.

You recall Zovaal's Cauldron, I trust? The denizens there were forged in unholy fire. Assuming their anima is of a similar nature, it should be able to melt even the metals of the tower.

With my device and their anima, I believe you can achieve your goal, Maw Walker.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Purchase an Anima Supricifer from Ve'nari and recover $2oa Molten Anima.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Your success continues to impress, Maw Walker.

Though I admit, such feats are becoming less unexpected as I come to know you more.</RewardText>
