  <Title>Finding a Witness</Title>
  <Description>You have rescued two of our allies from Torghast, but Anduin and Thrall have yet to be found.

That tower's corridors are vast... seemingly endless. You could spend an eternity wandering those unholy halls.

In your expeditions, you have encountered many unfortunate prisoners. Perhaps one of them has seen or heard something that could guide our search.

Seek out any captives that might have the information we need, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Look for a prisoner in Torghast who might know where Anduin or Thrall is being held.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Oribos and tell him about Thrall.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>I am heartened to know that Thrall yet lives. By the Light, we will find him.

I fear for Anduin. Darkness hungers for his soul.

We must make ready. You will hear from me when it is time to proceed.</RewardText>
