  <Title>Information for a Price</Title>
  <Description>We must continue our search for Jaina Proudmoore. I have a new strategy to suggest.

Since arriving in Oribos, I have been approached by many of the brokers. Some ask questions, others offer help--for a price.

You have encountered others of their kind inside Torghast. They may possess information we can use, though I doubt they will part with it freely.

Seek them out and appeal to their avarice. Offer to pay for whatever information they possess.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Question the Brokers trapped inside Torghast.</LogDescription>
