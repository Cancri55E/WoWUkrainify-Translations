  <Title>Rule 2: Keep a Low Profile</Title>
  <Description>Though you may wish to depart with your precious souls in tow, we now have additional matters to settle first.

The Eye of the Jailer is upon you. And that does not bode well for either of us.

Take this device. You will reinforce my wards to ensure he does not take notice of me as well.

The last thing I need is a loud, inelegant mortal bringing more attention my way. I can't have the Jailer capturing me, after all.

I'm far too valuable.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Reinforce $1oa Soul Wards.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That should be enough to hide us from the Jailer's sight.

I need you alive. For the time being, at least.

Now, back to business.</RewardText>
