  <Description>Ah, Maw Walker! Allow me to introduce myself. I am Ve'rayn. I deal with assets and liabilities for Cartel Ve.

I have heard that you are able to freely travel between Oribos and the Maw, a place of great interest to my cartel.

Would you mind if I ask you a few questions about it?

You will, of course, be properly compensated for your time and information. They are the most valuable of commodities, after all.</Description>
