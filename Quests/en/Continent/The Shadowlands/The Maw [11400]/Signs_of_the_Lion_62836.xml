  <Title>Signs of the Lion</Title>
  <Description>Thanks to your efforts, Thrall, Jaina Proudmoore, and Baine Bloodhoof are safe. Yet so long as the Jailer holds any hero of Azeroth, I fear he has power over us all.

It seems Anduin has been taken deeper into the tower than the others. Before I risk peering inside, you must make one last attempt to find him.

You say the Jailer spoke of honing a weapon. I fear we are running out of time.

Do not relent, $n. Search the twisting corridors of Torghast for any sign of the Young Lion.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Enter Torghast and explore the Twisting Corridors for any sign of Anduin Wrynn.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Bring the clues you found to Highlord Bolvar Fordragon in Oribos.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Three sure signs of Anduin's presence, yet no sign of him.

This is dire news indeed.</RewardText>
