  <Title>Soulless Husks</Title>
  <Description>Some of the Mawsworn begin as inanimate suits of armor, forged by the stygian smiths of Zovaal's Cauldron. Once fashioned, they await infusion of a decrepit shade to complete their genesis.

It is at this time they are the most vulnerable, and so it is then you should strike.

The hammers wielded by the Mawsworn runesmiths hold the power to break as well as they shape. Procure one of them and smash our foes to dust before they can rise against us.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain a Stygian Hammer from a Stygian Runesmith and destroy $2oa Armored Husks in Zovaal's Cauldron.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Satisfying, is it not?

The fewer Mawsworn to rise into the Jailer's ranks, the better for our continued existence.</RewardText>
