  <Title>Remnants of Hope</Title>
  <Description>I studied the key you brought back from Torghast, $n.

It confirms that Jaina Proudmoore is still being held somewhere in the tower. However we do not know precisely where.

Countless souls are captive inside that wretched place. A few may be intact, but many are shattered and broken.

Take pity upon the remnants and free those you can. Perhaps they will be able to aid our search.</Description>
