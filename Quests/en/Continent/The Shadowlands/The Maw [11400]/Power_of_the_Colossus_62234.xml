  <Description>I have another task for you, Maw Walker.

Deep within Perdition Hold, there lurks a menacing mechanization known as the Soulsteel Colossus. It must be destroyed before it wreaks havoc upon us.

Shatter the colossus and bring me its power source as proof of your victory.</Description>
