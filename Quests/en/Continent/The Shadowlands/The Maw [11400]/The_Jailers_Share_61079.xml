  <Title>The Jailer's Share</Title>
  <Description>The Mawsworn's torturers have a talent for misery.

The suffering they inflict often produces more stygia than they can collect. The excess floats loosely in the air, left to drift into the abyss.

I have fashioned a conduit specifically for capturing the leftover stygia. You can borrow it if you wish.

There are a handful of prime gathering locations throughout Calcis. As you'll be using my conduits, we can split what you find upon your return.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place $1oa Stygia Conduits at marked locations within Calcis in The Maw.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It is satisfying to know that the Jailer's share now belongs to us. Well done, Maw Walker.</RewardText>
