  <Title>Rule 5: Be Audacious</Title>
  <Description>You have proven yourself a useful associate, $c. In thanks, I have crafted a cypher that will allow you to venture further into the Maw.

But... it is experimental in nature. You will have to test it in the field. And I have just the test in mind.

Cartel Ve has foolishly sent more agents into the Maw. They were captured and taken to Perdition Hold. I must know why.

Breach the fortress and learn what has become of the captive brokers. Nothing is more valuable than knowledge of your enemy's plans.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Investigate the increased activity within Perdition Hold.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The Beastwarrens, you say... I wonder what they are plotting...

Such an embarrassment that they were discovered and captured in the first place. It seems Cartel Ve has become quite careless in my absence.

You have my gratitude for your assistance, as always. I will inform you when I have need of your services again.</RewardText>
