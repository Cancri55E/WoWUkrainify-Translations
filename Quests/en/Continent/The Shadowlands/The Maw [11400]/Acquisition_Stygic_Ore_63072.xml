  <Title>Acquisition: Stygic Ore</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The rock columns in this area are teeming with veins of a glowing, otherworldly metal. 

The Mawsworn have employed souls to mine it, but it looks like they didn't last long.

Ve'nari could certainly find use for some of this ore, if you can manage to mine it.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa pieces of Stygic Ore in Marrow's Coppice and return them to Ve'nari in the Maw.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Ve'nari at Ve'nari's Refuge.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Fascinating, the metal here seems to be fabricated entirely of stygia!

There is much I can do with this. Take this reward, with my thanks.</RewardText>
