  <Title>A Suitable Demise</Title>
  <Description>Surviving in this miserable place has been difficult, but I must confess... sending a few Mawsworn to a suitable demise does bring me joy.

The soulforgers in Zovaal's Cauldron are among the cruelest minions the Jailer employs. I find satisfaction in disposing of their cores in the very forges which they maintain.

This of course has the added benefit of temporarily slowing down their arms production, if you require more sober justification for your actions.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Throw $1oa Soulforged Cores into Soulforges in Zovaal's Cauldron in the Maw.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Next time, ask me how to run a stampede of mawrats off the edge of a cliff. That never fails to entertain.</RewardText>
