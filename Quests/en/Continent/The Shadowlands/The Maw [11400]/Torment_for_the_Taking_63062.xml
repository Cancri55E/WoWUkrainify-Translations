  <Title>Torment for the Taking</Title>
  <Description>&lt;A broker device has been abandoned here. It seems like it was being used to siphon energy from rifts of soul energy that have erupted in the area.

The brokers surely would not have sought to harness this energy if it didn't have a use. Perhaps you should finish what they started.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Fill the Phasic Siphoner from the Soul Fissures in Detrithos and return it to Ve'nari in the Maw.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Ve'nari at Ve'nari's Refuge.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>You've found my siphoner. You are just full of surprises, Maw Walker.

The unique way that pain and suffering manifests physically in the Maw is a mystery... one which this energy you've collected may help unravel. 

Well done.</RewardText>
