  <Title>Eye of the Scryer</Title>
  <Description>Evading the Mawsworn's scryers requires powerful magical countermeasures.

The prime reagent? A luminescent eye, pried from the skull of a scryer recently shaken from its trance.

The scrying ritual begins as we speak. You will, of course, be compensated only for an intact eye.

Restraint is advised in its procurement.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Obtain the Eye of the Scryer from Leerok the Scryer in The Maw.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Do you think he saw that one coming?
