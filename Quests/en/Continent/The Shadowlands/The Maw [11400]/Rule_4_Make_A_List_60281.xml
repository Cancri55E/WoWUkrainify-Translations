  <Title>Rule 4: Make A List</Title>
  <Description>I've discovered that one of the Jailer's inquisitors is attempting to devise a method to track my movements.

Clearly, that is a problem for me... and by extension, it is a problem for you.

The inquisitor has risen to the top of my list of potential threats. In the past, I would have had to deal with him myself. But now... I have a business partner.

Put an end to him, yes? And if you can, determine exactly how he intended to track me.</Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>Inquisitor Devaki</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>Slay Inquisitor Devaki and uncover how he is learning more about the brokers.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Kill Inquisitor Devaki and find out how he is trying to track Ve'nari.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Fine work. This should keep the both of us safe from the Mawsworn. 

I will hold onto the sphere that you found for the purpose of study.

Don't you have other matters to attend to?</RewardText>
