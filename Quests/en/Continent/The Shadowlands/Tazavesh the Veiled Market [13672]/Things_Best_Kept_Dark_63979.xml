  <Description>The leader of Cartel So represents a grave danger to the Shadowlands, Maw Walker.

Her name is So'leah. She seeks to assemble an artifact of the First Ones and use its power for selfish ends.

Pieces of the relic are said to be hidden on your homeworld. Brokers have never before found our way there. But if So'leah does, then Azeroth too is imperiled.

We must intercept her.

There is cargo nearby marked for Cartel So. Perhaps the manifest will give us clues as to their leader's whereabouts.</Description>
