  <Title>Above My Station</Title>
  <Description>While I indeed know the location of the Veiled Market, I fear I can do little in terms of providing you with transportation to it.

In return for your assistance with a task, I can send you to someone who can assist us both. There is a bounty hunter at Transfer Station Ta, a broker enclave in Bastion. He is better suited to help you... and he owes me a shipment.

Meet with Ta'oku and tell him that Ta'nla sent you.

For your convenience, I can offer use of a portal. After all, we are partners, yes?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take the portal at the Night Market and speak with Ta'oku.</LogDescription>
