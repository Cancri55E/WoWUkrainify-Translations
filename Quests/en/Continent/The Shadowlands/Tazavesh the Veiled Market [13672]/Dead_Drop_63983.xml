  <Title>Dead Drop</Title>
  <Description>Ta'nla requested something very... specific... on behalf of a client.

The kyrian have been working on a new type of centurion they call an aquilon. I sent some of our trade specialists to retrieve the prototype in question, but they have yet to return. 

Until I have the item, there is obviously no way I can ship it to Ta'nla. Perhaps we can help one another.

If you can locate the aquilon and bring it here, I will help you reach Tazavesh.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve the Prototype Aquilon.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Perfect! This will put us back on schedule.</RewardText>
