  <Title>Coins for the Ferryman</Title>
  <Description>Your side of the deal is done, Maw Walker. Now for your payment.

My cartel runs a ferry that travels between Oribos and Tazavesh. Its purpose is to transport cargo, but as in all things, there are... exceptions.

Take this coin to Ta'meri and you will be provided safe passage to the market.

What happens after that is up to you.

&lt;Ta'oku bows, uttering a sound that seems almost like a chuckle.&gt;</Description>
