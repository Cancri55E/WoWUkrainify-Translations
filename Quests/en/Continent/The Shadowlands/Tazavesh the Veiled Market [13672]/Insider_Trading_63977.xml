  <Description>I am the foremost expert on broker culture. However, relationships between cartels are complicated and unstable.

Cartel So holds a small presence here in Oribos, which means the other cartels may have knowledge that I do not. Ask around; with your renown, surely they'll have whatever information that we are missing.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with various broker cartels around Oribos.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you had a chance to speak with the other cartels?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>How rude! They should be aware of who they are talking to.

I apologize for my kin, Maw Walker.</RewardText>
