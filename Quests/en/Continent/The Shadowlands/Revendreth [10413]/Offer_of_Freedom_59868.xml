  <Title>Offer of Freedom</Title>
  <Description>Just as I was, some of the Briarbane venthyr you encounter will have been compelled to serve Matyas. They likely will not want to fight you, but will have no choice. Once they are injured, they may be willing to pause to see if one of the sinstones you recovered earlier is theirs.

Free those you can. The use of a sinstone to compel others isn't fair.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Weaken Briarbane venthyr and then offer them a sinstone.</LogDescription>
