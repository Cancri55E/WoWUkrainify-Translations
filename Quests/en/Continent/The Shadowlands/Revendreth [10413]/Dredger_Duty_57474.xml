  <Title>Dredger Duty</Title>
  <Description>You fixed up the muck pool so we can make some dredgers, but them devourers are gonna keep causin' trouble.

We're gonna need a Gem of Binding so we can dredge up a biggun to protect the pool.

I'll show you how to dredge up some disposable dredgers to work with for now.

Get 'em digging in the rubble to find us a Gem of Binding, and then we'll reshape 'em all into a biggun to kick them devourers outta here!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Dredge a dredger and bring it to the pile of rubble. Wait for it to dig through the pile and collect the Gem of Binding.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Got a bit of devourer gunk on it, but it will have to do.</RewardText>
