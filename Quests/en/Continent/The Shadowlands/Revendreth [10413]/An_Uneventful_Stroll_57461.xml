  <Title>An Uneventful Stroll</Title>
  <Description>I hope I wasn't too unpleasant while under the Light's influence. I do try to restrain myself, but the pain it causes is... maddening.

Anyway, that tea picked me right up!

When I last saw Prince Renathal, the Master was dragging him off to that big tower looming over the Ember Ward.

Myself and a few others have been working to gain access to that tower from below, but there are... obstacles.

When you're ready to depart, I will lead you to our headquarters of sorts, the Sanctuary of the Mad.</Description>

What a delightful stroll!</RewardText>
