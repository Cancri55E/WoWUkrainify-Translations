  <Title>TEMP MAW RUN</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Placeholder Quest. Thank you for your patience as our dev team works to make the Maw experience the coolest thing we can. In the meantime, please enjoy a sample of a snarky sword and her fourth wall breaking objectives.&gt;

Look, normally I would give you a quest to storm the very Maw itself looking for Prince Renathal before he gets transferred in to the dreaded Torghast, Tower of the Damned.

However, since that is NOT something we can do. Let's just assume we did and go talk to that projection of him</Description>
