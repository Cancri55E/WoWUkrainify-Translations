  <Title>The Endmire</Title>
  <Description>Oi! You.

Not sure what landed you in the Endmire but I need your help.

See these torches? It's my gig to keep 'em lit. But it ain't like they runnin' on flint n' tinder.

My stash of infused rubies got hauled off by some devourers when my back was turned. Can ya find 'em before we both get ate by one of these horrors?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find $1oa Infused Rubies.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Much obliged. These torches keep the effects of the Endmire at bay. Even scares away the devourers for the moment. Only lasts so long though. 

I miss the good ol' days of only having to worry about manifestations down here.</RewardText>
