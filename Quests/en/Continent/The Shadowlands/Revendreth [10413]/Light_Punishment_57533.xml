  <Title>Light Punishment</Title>
  <Description>The reasons we were banished here differ, but our goal once we arrive is always the same--to avoid becoming ash.

The Shrouded control the areas shaded from Light. Those that trespass within their stronghold are made to suffer. Our flesh blisters and burns, yet we do not die. Instead, our minds descend into madness from the pain.

I do not claim to know the crimes of those trapped within the Light, but I know this is not the Maw. It is not our role to punish.

Free the others as you have freed me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Free $1oa Blistering Outcasts.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You freed them, yes? Let us hope they found some small sliver of respite, where the Light cannot reach.</RewardText>
