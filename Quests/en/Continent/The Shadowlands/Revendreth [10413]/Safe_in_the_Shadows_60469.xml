  <Title>Safe in the Shadows</Title>
  <Description>I cannot recollect what happened. Perhaps the Light has burdened my memory? Who knows how long I've been out here...

So long as my assailants remain at large, my companions could be in danger. Will you find them and ensure they're still safe in the shadows?</Description>
