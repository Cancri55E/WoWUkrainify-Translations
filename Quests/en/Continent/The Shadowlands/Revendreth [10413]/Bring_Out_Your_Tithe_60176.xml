  <Title>Bring Out Your Tithe</Title>
  <Description>Unfortunately the Lord Chamberlain's gift isn't sufficient to cover the entire tithe we're expected to provide the Tithelord, but it will make a good start.

The loss of the tithe convoy is a terrible blow to our village. Our little community is already suffering greatly from the drought and the need to meet the Tithelord's demands. Still we must all do our part.

We have little time to accomplish this task. Can you help? Get the tithe from villagers and scour the area for every forgotten drop.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect anima from the village for the tithe.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I was not sure this task was possible. Very impressive work.</RewardText>
