  <Title>The Penitent Hunt</Title>
  <Description>You will descend upon these poor souls. Remember, you are helping them and Revendreth through the terror you bring. When a soul is filled with fear, their resistances to our methods falter.

The Master has requested that you hunt the Accuser yourself. But we must prey upon some of the others first.

I will be able to guide you through your first hunt.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to the Fearstalker in Wanecrypt Hill and participate in the Penitent Hunt.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Well done. The fear we struck allowed us to extract ample anima for Revendreth.

Onto our final target.</RewardText>
