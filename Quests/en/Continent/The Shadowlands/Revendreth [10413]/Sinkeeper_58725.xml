  <Description>This is a Bell of Remembrance. Before the recent... "events" we used them to beckon souls from the Crypt of the Forgotten to deem their fate. 

If they are less arrogant than they were before, they may continue in the process. If not, they must spend additional time in the crypt.

Let's put this one to use, shall we? It's pretty beat up, let's hope we can get at least one use out of it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Bell of Remembrance to beckon a soul from the Crypt of the Forgotten. Then, deem the soul's fate.</LogDescription>
