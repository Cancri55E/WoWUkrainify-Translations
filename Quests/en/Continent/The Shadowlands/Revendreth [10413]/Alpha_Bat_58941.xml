  <Title>Alpha Bat</Title>
  <Description>Dredbats are quite useful to us. We make them just like stoneborn, but they lack their same... intelligence. With very little direction, they strike fear into stubborn souls' hearts.

With the anima drought, our dominion over them has waned. One, Duskterror, has wreaked the most havoc.

This presents us with an opportunity. Take this soul and draw her in. When she's weak, we can capture her for our own purposes.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>Duskterror has gotten out of control. We need to capture her before she brings any more havoc.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Hitch Houndmaster Loksey to the stake in the Grove of Terror. Then, weaken Duskterror to capture her.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Now that Duskterror is captured, we have a little more control over these grounds.</RewardText>
