  <Title>WANTED: Enforcer Kristof</Title>
  <Description>WARNING!

Shrouded patrols have increased throughout the Ember Ward. By order of Enforcer Kristof, all who are found near the asylum will be forced to endure the Light. 

Use extreme caution when venturing beyond our sanctuary. Even the shadows are not safe so long as Kristof remains in power.  

A reward awaits whoever is able to rid the ward of this tyrant.
