  <Title>Paragon of the Court of Harvesters</Title>
  <Description>Maw Walker. 

Your efforts have provided the Court of Harvesters a decisive edge in their ongoing conflict with the zealots and sycophants who cling to the lost cause of Sire Denathrius.

If you will join me in Darkhaven we can express our gratitude to you in a more... physical... way. 

With treasure, of course.</Description>
