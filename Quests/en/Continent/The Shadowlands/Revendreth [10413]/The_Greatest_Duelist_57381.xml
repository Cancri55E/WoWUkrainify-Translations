  <Title>The Greatest Duelist</Title>
  <Description>A mortal in Revendreth. Well, well, well... you are primed to be at the head of high adventure.$b$bThe name you may call me is Nadjia the Mistblade, and, if I might be so humble as to say, I am the finest duelist that has ever wielded a sword.$b$bThis trap you found me in was a lesson learned in getting paid in advance. Release me and my blade is yours to command for as long as I find you interesting.$b$bDo we have an accord?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Release Nadjia the Mistblade.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That was FUN! I have not felt so alive in centuries. Everything about you is just... different, and invigorating.

I can continue to assist you until you are ready to leave the Endmire but then we will need to part ways for a time. I have some unfinished business regarding someone who put me in a cage.</RewardText>
