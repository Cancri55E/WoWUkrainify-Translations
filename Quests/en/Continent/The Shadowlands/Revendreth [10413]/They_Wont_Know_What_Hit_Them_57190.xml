  <Description>Luring the Fearstalker here will prove pointless unless we can tilt the odds. She will surely show up with a small army. 

Plant these anima containers. When the time comes, we will release their contents into the air, dousing her and her forces in a thick layer of anima.

That should get the devourers infesting this place to flock to them like moths to a flame.</Description>
