  <Title>Where is Prince Renathal?</Title>
  <Description>This is not victory, $p. If Prince Renathal does not return, we've merely delayed defeat.

The Prince was last seen during an assault on the Master's keep alongside Duke Theotar.

We don't know the Prince's fate, but we've learned that Duke Theotar was banished to the Ember Ward.

The Ember Ward is a land of madness and torture. Blighted by the Light, the Master sends his most hated enemies there to suffer unending agony.

Enter the Ember Ward, find Theotar, and discover the Prince's fate.</Description>
