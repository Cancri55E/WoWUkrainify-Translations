  <Title>The Absolution of Souls</Title>
  <Description>Do you not yet understand the purpose of Revendreth, Maw Walker?

The souls under our care teeter on the brink of permanent damnation. Even with perfect attention and careful processing, not every soul can escape the Maw and be elevated to a higher destiny.

That is true under the best of circumstances.

Currently, due to your installation of the Chamberlain at the Halls of Atonement, we're instead witnessing the worst of circumstances.

We must return to the Halls of Atonement and enforce order.</Description>
