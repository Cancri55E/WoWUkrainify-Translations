  <Title>Inquisitor Vilhelm's Sinstone</Title>
  <Description>Inquisitor Vilhelm has taken exceptional precautions to protect his sinstone.

Broken into several pieces and hidden from sight, he believed his sinstone would be safe from us.

But his plan had the same weakness as most: he trusted weak-willed underlings.

I "interrogated" several dredgers to learn where they helped the inquisitor hide the broken fragments of his sinstone.

Find all the fragments and bring them to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect the 3 Hidden Sinstone Fragments.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Meet Echelon in the Halls of Atonement courtyard.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>&lt;As Echelon holds the sinstone fragments, anima binds draw the pieces into one another, reforming into a completed sinstone.&gt;

We are ready to proceed.</RewardText>
