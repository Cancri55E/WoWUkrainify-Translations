  <Title>The Field of Honor</Title>
  <Description>Thanks to you, $n, I am free of Matyas's control for the first time in ... well, a very long time. 

Now, together, we will seek my vengeance. 

I've laid a solemn duty upon you by naming you as my second for this duel. I know not the code in your homelands but in mine, it is your task to secure the field. Matyas and his followers are garrisoned at Witherfall Ruin nearby. Unless I miss my guess, that's where he will have run.

I will prepare for the battle and join you soon.</Description>
