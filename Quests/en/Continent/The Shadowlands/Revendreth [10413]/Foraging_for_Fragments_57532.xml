  <Title>Foraging for Fragments</Title>
  <Description>Forgive me. I don't mean to appear ungrateful, but my mirror fragments are missing.

I shouldn't be surprised, really. They're quite powerful and I'm sure the miscreants out here would be happy to get their hands on them.

Nonetheless, I will not let this deter me.

The Master sends his stone servants to smash any mirrors erected in this ward, so we should have no trouble finding fragments nearby.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Follow Laurent and collect Mirror Fragments.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This must be some sort of mistake!</RewardText>
