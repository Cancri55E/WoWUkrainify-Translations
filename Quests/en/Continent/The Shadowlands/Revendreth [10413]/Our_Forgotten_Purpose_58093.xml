  <Title>Our Forgotten Purpose</Title>
  <Description>I have no quarrel with you, Maw Walker.

The Lord Chamberlain and his abhorrent followers have debased these halls with their perversions of the rituals. Abusing souls and destroying their potential for pathetic mockeries of power.

The Accuser would never have allowed this. I have heard rumors that you may still be in contact with her. If so, please inform her of the situation here.

She will bring these depraved dogs to heel.</Description>
