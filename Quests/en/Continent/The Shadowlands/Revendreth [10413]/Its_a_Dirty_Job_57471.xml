  <Title>It's a Dirty Job</Title>
  <Description>This muck pool is all out of order. The anima shortage has taken its toll here for sure. 

You see, the pools require filth and fiber to grow dredgers effectively. The problem is every time I try to treat the pool, the dang devourers are on my back!

Now the untreated muck is starting to coagulate into these elementals! Can you go and toss some of the filthy rubble into the pool to restore it?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Throw Filthy Rubble into the muck pool.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I can smell it from here. Thanks for that, $n.</RewardText>
