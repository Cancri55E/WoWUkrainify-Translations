  <Title>In the Ruin of Rebellion</Title>
  <Description>Well, here we are -- Sinfall.

Last I saw, the Master was dragging Prince Renathal and his most loyal followers here in a prison convoy. However, this is a forbidden place, wrapped in rumors and mystery. I heard it was once the workshop of Denathrius, where he performed dark experiments.

Intriguing to be sure, but we are here to find Renathal. Search below, but proceed with caution. I will send word for the Accuser to make her way here with what allies she can muster.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search Sinfall for any signs of Prince Renathal.</LogDescription>
