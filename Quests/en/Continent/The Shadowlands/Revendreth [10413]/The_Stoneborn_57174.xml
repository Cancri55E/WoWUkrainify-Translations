  <Title>The Stoneborn</Title>
  <Description>The Stone Legion is not even here yet? This is an outrage.

If we do not do something quickly, the rebels will overrun this filthy hamlet.

Here, take the anima and go activate a few of the stoneborn along the periphery of Darkhaven. Take whatever is left over to the Quartermaster and tell her to do her job.

I will try to commune with the Master and see if he can send reinforcements.</Description>
