  <Title>Reinforcing Revendreth</Title>
  <Description>Denathrius must be stopped at all costs. However, we've no hope of taking him out while his forces still control much of Revendreth.

If you are here to aid us, then there is no shortage of work to be done. Disposing of my father's many allies being chief among that work, of course, but any aid you can provide will be of use.

There is too much at stake for all the Shadowlands if we fail. I will see to it that you are handsomely rewarded for your efforts.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Aid Revendreth by completing Side Quests, Bonus Objectives, World Quests, and slaying rare creatures. You may also defeat powerful foes in Revendreth dungeons.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You have my sincere gratitude for aiding our cause. Together we will see Denathrius's hold on our realm broken, and with it win the freedom of my people.

I cannot offer as much as I would like, but I hope it will suffice until our victory is achieved.</RewardText>
