  <Title>Blinded By The Light</Title>
  <Description>$p, Sire Denathrius must be stopped. The anima he is stealing from the Shadowlands is weakening the bonds that seal the Jailer within the Maw. That must not happen.

Time is short so we must strike quickly. I would like for you to head up to the surface, into that accursed Light, and align as many mirrors as you can find to the focusing mirror atop the portcullis.

We will shine a light on Castle Nathria so bright no venthyr will wish to step forth from that fortress to challenge us.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the mirrors atop Sinfall to seal the gates of Castle Nathria.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That should buy us some time and carve us a bit of a path. Now to take advantage of the situation.</RewardText>
