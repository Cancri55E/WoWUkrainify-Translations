  <Title>It's a Trap</Title>
  <Description>At last, I will have my vengeance!

I am certain Matyas will flee again if he sees me first so you will need to confront him on my behalf, friend. Then, while he's distracted, I will engage him.

At that point, your obligation as my second is a formality. You must assure Matyas does not dishonor the duel and cheat. When he inevitably does, I expect you'll help me defeat him.

He's just through the portcullis there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Approach Matyas to start the duel. Assist Nadjia when Matyas cheats.</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>I would have allowed an apology, but he chose treachery and has paid the price.</RewardText>
