  <Title>Reason for the Treason</Title>
  <Description>If you ask me, the attack on our convoy is suspicious. I told Mistress Mihaela that there must be a traitor in the village, but she isn't concerned. It's understandable. She's got to worry about gathering a new tithe.

I've taken it upon myself to figure this out and I could use your help. I'm making discreet inquiries but I can't be seen speaking with the help. That's where you come in. You can be my assistant sleuth.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with the "help" in the village to find clues leading to the identity of the traitor.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Well, isn't that interesting information you've dug up.</RewardText>
