  <Title>My Terrible Morning</Title>
  <Description>You simply won't believe what happened to me!

I was out for my daily stroll when Marquis Pummeler and his band of ruffians assailed me!

Amongst the many unfortunate and ungentlemanly behaviors they displayed was destroying my parasol.

A tragedy of the highest order!

Without it, I'm afraid I'm left quite vulnerable to the oppressive Light that curses this land.

The Marquis controls a coveted shaded hideout nearby. Will you avenge my parasol and teach this ruffian some manners?</Description>
