  <Title>An Unfortunate Situation</Title>
  <Description>Laurent, mirror maker to the Master. Pleasure to meet you. Excuse my disheveled appearance. It appears I've found myself in a most unfortunate situation.

I was attempting to travel on royal business when my mirror sent me to this wasteland instead.

Not a moment after I arrived, a band of exiles ripped the clothes right from my back, making it impossible for me to traverse this unforgiving terrain.

Assist me and I will endeavor to create a mirror which will allow us to escape this wretched place.</Description>
