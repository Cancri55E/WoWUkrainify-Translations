  <Description>Psst. You there. Yeah, you.

You that Maw Walker them fangs been going on about? Huh. I figured you'd be bigger.

Anyway, the Taskmaster wants to ahhh ... "extend his compliments and an invitation to visit his workings." That's a fancy word for a bunch of rocks me and my mates are diggin' up.

If you're keen an' all that, pop down to Feeder's Thicket and meet with the fang's courier, Araak. He'll get you sorted right out.</Description>
