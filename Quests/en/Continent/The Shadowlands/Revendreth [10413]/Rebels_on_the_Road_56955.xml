  <Title>Rebels on the Road</Title>
  <Description>This is unacceptable. The stoneborn rebels have ambushed a convoy intended for the Tithelord. He is the local Harvester who rules this ward. 

We need to get through this mess. The bridge on the far side of this conflict leads to Darkhaven. The Master typically keeps some of his own Stone Legion forces there. 

Carve us a way through, Maw Walker. Destroy any who would delay us. We must not keep Sire Denathrius waiting.</Description>
