  <Title>Mirror Making, Not Breaking</Title>
  <Description>Denathrius does not allow mirrors to be erected within the ember ward. His stone servants shatter anything that so much as glints. 

I need you to remain vigilant as I make this mirror. I have no doubt that the Master's minions will try to stop us. 

Are you ready?</Description>

  <RewardText>Simone is right. We don't have time for idle chatter. Not here, at least.

The mirror we've repaired will take you to safety.</RewardText>
