  <Title>The Sinstone Archive</Title>
  <Description>You said Inquisitor Traian oversaw the ritual?

&lt;Archivist Fane searches the massive archives in this chamber.&gt;

We archivists maintain strict records of every soul that passes through these halls.

Or at least we're supposed to. The sinstones of powerful venthyr tend to go "missing."

&lt;Archivist Fane rolls his eyes.&gt;

I don't see his sinstone here. He might've stolen it, or someone could be hoarding it as blackmail.

Help me complete my archives, and I'll get you any sinstone you need.</Description>
