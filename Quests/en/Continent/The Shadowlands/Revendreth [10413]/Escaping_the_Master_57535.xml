  <Title>Escaping the Master</Title>
  <Description>Now more than ever I wish to escape this place, but I cannot go back to serve the Master. Not after seeing what goes on here.

Simone and I are in agreement. With your assistance, I will craft a mirror that connects to a sanctuary controlled by the prince. We will leave this place and pledge our support to Renathal. 

But first, I'll need fragments of glass. The Shrouded seem to have plenty, and the fewer they have to make traps, the better.</Description>

Yes, these should work. I'm almost certain.</RewardText>
