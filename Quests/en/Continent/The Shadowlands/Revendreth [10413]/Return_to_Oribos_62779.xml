  <Title>Return to Oribos</Title>
  <Description>I truly wish you could remain here and aid our cause--it is truly the most pressing manner in all the Shadowlands--but Revendreth alone cannot stand against the growing darkness.

You must return to Oribos and ensure the other realms do not falter in their commitments. Tal-Inara will be able to guide you appropriately.

Thank you once again for your aid, mortal. May our paths cross again.</Description>
