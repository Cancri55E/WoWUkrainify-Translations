  <Title>Into the Light</Title>
  <Description>I am afraid that you must endure the next stretch of the stroll without me, $p.

While my compatriots and I have secured access to the elevator that shall carry us up to Sinfall, we are unable to utilize it.

The Master has redirected a massive beam of Light directly onto the elevator's landing.

Dredgers sent up never return.

We need someone who can walk in the Light to discover what is happening up there.
