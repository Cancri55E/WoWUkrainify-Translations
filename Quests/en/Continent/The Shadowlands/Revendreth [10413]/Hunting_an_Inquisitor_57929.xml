  <Title>Hunting an Inquisitor</Title>
  <Description>You may have noticed that inquisitors are protected by the Lord Chamberlain's magic. A potent consequence of wielding the Master's medallion.

But now that we have access to Inquisitor Traian's sinstone from the archives, we have the power needed to break through those defenses.

Locate the inquisitor, and order Temel to read out from his sinstone. Declaring the true name and sins of the inquisitor will shatter his defenses and make him vulnerable for a short window of time.

Be ready to strike.</Description>
