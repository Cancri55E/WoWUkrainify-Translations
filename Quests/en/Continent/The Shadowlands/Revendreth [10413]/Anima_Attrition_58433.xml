  <Title>Anima Attrition</Title>
  <Description>This is not some simple raid or protest. These stoneborn mean to steal the anima this convoy was carrying.

That anima was destined to be tithed to the Master. There is a drought on and we cannot let these vagabonds and miscreants steal our hard-earned anima.

Recover the tithe if you can and I will see to your notoriety.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover the Anima Canister.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Well done, mortal. Stoneborn require anima to exist. Without it, they return to their stone form. This supply hurt them more than destroying thirty of their rebels.</RewardText>
