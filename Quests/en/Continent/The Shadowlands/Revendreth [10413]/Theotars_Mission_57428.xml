  <Title>Theotar's Mission</Title>
  <Description>Oh the Accuser sent you? How keen!

I do, in fact, know the fate of Prince Renathal... at least part of it.

When our assault on the Master's keep failed, we were both captured. I was banished to the Ember Ward, but the Prince was dragged off to Sinfall.

I'm cultivating an escape from this Light-blighted land to follow after him, but the Light here... it makes it hard to think.

My parasol once protected me, but the ruffians destroyed it. Help me rebuild it, and we'll find the Prince together.</Description>
