  <Title>A Reflection of Truth</Title>
  <Description>I sent the Fearstalker far from here with that trap--buying us some time.

On the other side of this mirror lies the depths of Castle Nathria, the fortress of Denathrius himself. There, a meeting between Denathrius and one of his lackeys is about to take place.

Join me through the mirror, $n. You shall see the truth of this "drought" first hand.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Follow the Accuser through the mirror and witness the truth of Revendreth.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We barely made it. Denathrius will surely be on our trail soon.</RewardText>
