  <Title>It's a Dirty Job</Title>
  <Description>We gotta fix up this muck pool before we go makin' that dredger butler of yours.

Looks like the anima shortage caused all sorts of problems for this pool.

Them muck pools gotta have plenty of filth and fiber in 'em to grow good dredgers.

But between them devourers and nasty elementals formin' from all that wild muck, I can't get close enough to feed it!

Help me out and throw some of that filthy rubble into the pool, yeah?</Description>
