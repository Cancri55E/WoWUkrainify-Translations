  <Title>Ritual of Absolution</Title>
  <Description>The ritual of absolution is a sacred rite that forces souls to discard the burdens of their mortal lives.

The soul must be a willing participant if the ritual's effect will be meaningful and long-lasting. We often spend ages preparing a soul for a single absolution ritual.

The Lord Chamberlain has neglected his duty. These souls are overdue for absolution, practically bursting with anima.

We will perform the ritual ourselves, and hurry these souls along their journey.</Description>
