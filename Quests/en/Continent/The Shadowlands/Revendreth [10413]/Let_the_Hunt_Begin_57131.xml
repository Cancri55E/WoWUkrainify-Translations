  <Title>Let the Hunt Begin</Title>
  <Description>One step remains until we may begin the Penitent Hunt.

You and the other hunters will first siphon a small amount of anima from the souls. It will come with ease. The soul's time in the Grove of Terror causes trace anima to release.

This anima helps us venthyr in tracking the prey's fear.

I also ask that you do us the honor of signaling the hunt.

&lt;The Fearstalker hands you an anima stake and a hollowed dredbat fang.&gt;

Use these to complete the task.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Complete the hunting ritual at Wanecrypt Hill.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Well done. Perhaps in death you will make a fine hunter.

I can practically taste the fear we will inflict.</RewardText>
