  <Title>Finders-Keepers, Sinners-Weepers</Title>
  <Description>Oh hello, mortal. You have a real knack for arriving at the most opportune times. I wonder what Taskmaster Matyas wants with you. Curious.

As for me, again Matyas has used my sinstone against me. I was already enraged that he caged me and I assure you that this latest attack will not go unanswered. Yet, while he has my sinstone I am unable to act against him directly. So we must remedy that.

You question the laborers and I will read this journal while I regain my strength.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Discover the secrets of Taskmaster Matyas's efforts in Feeder's Thicket.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ah. A pity none of these are mine. Still they may prove useful.</RewardText>
