  <Description>Every good party herald needs an assistant. Which is why I have you!

But every good party herald's assistant... also needs an assistant.

Which is why I procured permission from the prince for you to create your own dredger butler. We can start him on security while we cozy up to the guests and procure the necessary reading materials to train him on the social protocols of the different realms. He'll be entertaining the whole court in no time. 

No, don't thank me. You've earned this!</Description>
