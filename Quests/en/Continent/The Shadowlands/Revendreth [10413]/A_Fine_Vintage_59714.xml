  <Title>A Fine Vintage</Title>
  <Description>We will need something special to use as the base of our mixture. To get him to drink it down he will have to believe you've brought him a gift. 

He fancies himself quite the connoisseur. Some ancient and stuffy vintage will tempt him.

Check the old cellar near the ruins. It once held supplies. Perhaps a bottle still lingers in the depths. Araak and I will work out the other details.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Nadjia a fancy beverage.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ah, that's perfect. He will not be able to resist this.</RewardText>
