  <Title>Dredging up an Assistant</Title>
  <Description>Here we go, onto the dredging part.

Just like we made that biggun here earlier!

I mean we don't need the stone of binding or three other dredgers, but you'll still be throwing stuff into the muck!

So it's the same. 

You head to the shore with this here Kaja-Infused Dredger Mix I whipped up for you.

Toss it into that muck pool and let's meet that new dredger butler of yours!</Description>
