  <Description>Sire Denathrius has requested I help you prepare for the hunt. Every hunter must help prepare a soul here in the Grove of Terror.

I have a stubborn soul here who's been quite uncooperative, Houndmaster Loksey. His time has come to be hunted.

&lt;The Fearstalker hands you a set of Hopebreaker Soul Chains.&gt;

Demoralize him. We can't let him leave here with any hope. The hunt is meant to break the souls so they become less... resistant to the processes of Revendreth.</Description>

  <QuestCompletionLog>Bring Houndmaster Loksey to Flockmaster Sergio in the Grove of Terror.</QuestCompletionLog>
