  <Title>Inquisitor Stelia's Sinstone</Title>
  <Description>You never truly escape your past, Maw Walker.

Every venthyr once entered Revendreth as a soul, burdened by the immoralities of their mortal lives.

Like all souls, they carved their true names and most shameful transgressions into sinstones.

Knowledge that intimate can be a potent weapon, if wielded properly.

Locate the sinstones of the inquisitors aiding the Accuser so that you may kill them. Start with Stelia.

After they're dead, bring me the Accuser's sinstone. I will deal with her myself.</Description>
