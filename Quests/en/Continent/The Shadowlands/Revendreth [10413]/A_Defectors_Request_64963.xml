  <Title>A Defector's Request</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Unrolling the scroll, you can make out that it's a coded arms requisition from the Maldraxxi of Death's End to their venthyr allies... all servants of the Jailer.

Surely someone among the Death's Advance in Korthia will be able to help you fully break the code and learn exactly what they were planning.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver the missive to Duchess Mynx in Keeper's Respite in Korthia.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;A smile creeps across Duchess Mynx's face as she looks over the scroll you provided. A moment later, an echoing laugh bursts from her.&gt;

The forces of the Jailer use such pathetic codes! This scroll of yours doesn't say where, but it seems there's a weapons cache ready to be claimed. A team of your allies should be able to investigate and retrieve it without too much trouble.</RewardText>
