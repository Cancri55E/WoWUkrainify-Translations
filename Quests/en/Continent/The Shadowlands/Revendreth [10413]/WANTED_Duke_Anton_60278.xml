  <Title>WANTED: Duke Anton</Title>
  <Description>Loyal Citizens of Revendreth: 

Duke Anton and his decrepit house are relics of noble venthyr society. 

His attempts to tarnish my name are laughable at best. 

It is time someone rid us of Duke Anton's presence for good.

I shall offer double whatever pathetic sum he can muster. 

Sincerely, 

Lord Darion of House Redelav</Description>
