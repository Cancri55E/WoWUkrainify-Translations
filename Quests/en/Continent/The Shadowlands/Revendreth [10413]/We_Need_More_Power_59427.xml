  <Title>We Need More Power</Title>
  <Description>Laurent's plan is a bit ambitious. 

Mirrors are most reliable when used to traverse short distances. Traveling to the sanctuary will require a great deal of power, more than he or I have. 

The shrouded have stores of anima in their compound. With enough of it, the mirror should be stable enough to get us where we need to go.</Description>

  <RewardText>Yes, this will do.</RewardText>
