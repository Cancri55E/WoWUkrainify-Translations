  <Title>WANTED: Lord Darion</Title>
  <Description>To Whom it May Concern: 

Lord Darion of House Redelav thinks that he can buy his place in society. 

He flaunts his wealth, using it to win favor of other lords and ladies. Is there no price on decency? 

This is not the way the noble houses of Revendreth should conduct themselves. 

I implore you to find Lord Darion and help him meet his true death. 

The honor of House Briarbane rests in your capable hands.

Warmest Regards, 

Duke Anton of House Briarbane</Description>
