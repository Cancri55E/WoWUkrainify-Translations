  <Title>Ritual of Judgment</Title>
  <Description>After all rituals of absolution are complete, each soul must face its final judgment in Revendreth.

There are three potential verdicts:
If proven unworthy, it is condemned to the Maw for eternity.

If fully absolved of its sins, it is either elevated to a venthyr or returned to the Arbiter to be assigned its new destination.

Our most sacred ritual, the judgment, determines this fate.

One such ritual is happening now. I will disguise you and we will participate to ensure a just verdict.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Participate in the ritual of judgment.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I sacrificed more than you realize to save this soul.

I would do it again, because it is right. Do you understand yet?</RewardText>
