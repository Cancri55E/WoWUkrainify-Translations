  <Description>&lt;Dracho motions to keep your voice down.&gt;

I need some assistance, I promise you will be paid handsomely. 

At the edge of The Banewood lies some ruins. These ruins are home to a marketplace run by some brokers. They won't let me back there. Let's just say that my goods were deemed to not be up to their authenticity metrics. 

But you... you're a Maw Walker! Bring them this package and exchange it for some Surberries from Ardenweald. 

Just don't say I sent you.</Description>
