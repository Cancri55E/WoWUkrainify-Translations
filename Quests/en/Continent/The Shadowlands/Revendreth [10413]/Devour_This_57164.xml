  <Title>Devour This</Title>
  <Description>Though the souls are our primary target, another challenge has arisen.

The Banewood has seen an infestation of devourers: disgusting vermin who gorge themselves on the anima we need to survive. A fitting challenge for any true hunter, no?

I should only thank the Master that they have remained in a few secluded pockets. I loathe to think that their numbers could multiply. Let us exterminate them before they pose a true threat.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Eliminate the devourers in the Banewood.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Once you master fear, all crumble before you.</RewardText>
