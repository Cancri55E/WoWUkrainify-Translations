  <Title>A Plea to the Harvesters</Title>
  <Description>You come during strange times. Every day the tithes we must pay to the Tithelord increase, and our ability to get anima dwindles. 

What souls we have to work with here are near their final judgment and we lack the resources to harvest them without endangering the hamlet.

If you have the ear of Lord Chamberlain, then you might be able to pass a message to the Master himself. 

Here, take this letter. Please see that it makes it to the hands of the Chamberlain.</Description>

  <RewardText>Oh, the peasants have asked for help have they? 

Those who are loyal would know that sacrifices are essential to the survival of Revendreth. Yes, these are dark times with anima and new souls both being in short supply. 

But we must all do our part, no matter how painful.</RewardText>
