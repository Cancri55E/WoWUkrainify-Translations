  <Title>Sanctum Upgrade: Anima Conductor</Title>
  <Description>Right. So we got all this anima you been collecting.

Thing is, all that anima originally got squeezed out of the other realms. The Master, he was big on drainin' anything that weren't him. 

So, we set up a Scroll of Dark Empowerment for you on the lower level. Should conjure somefin' strong enough for you to channel anima back into the Shadowlands, by way of Revendreth Wards. 

Seems to me there'd be some fringe benefits from somefin like that.</Description>
