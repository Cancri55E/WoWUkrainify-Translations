  <Title>Directions Not Included</Title>
  <Description>Look at this place! What a mess. The Locus is inactive and these "Forsworn" have taken over.

We need to restore the Locus, but I do not know how. This place is not of my design, built long, long ago.

Luckily, the previous Forgelite Prime was prolific. Recorded everything! If we can find her designs, I can certainly work it out. Even without Mnemis's help.

Look around. Plenty of scrolls strewn about. Meet me near the Locus when you find what I need.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find the Locus Manual among discarded scrolls in the Mnemonic Locus.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Meet Mikanikos near the Locus.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>You found it! And other interesting tomes as well. They will be properly catalogued when we are done.</RewardText>
