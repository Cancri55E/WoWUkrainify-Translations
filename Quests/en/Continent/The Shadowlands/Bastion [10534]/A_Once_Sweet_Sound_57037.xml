  <Title>A Once Sweet Sound</Title>
  <Description>The bells! That sound!

Their song has been twisted! If their dire toll continues, we will all succumb.

&lt;Eridia presses her hammer into your hands.&gt;

Find the great vespers within the temple and strike them with my hammer. May the mallet's tonal purity restore their true voices!

I will listen for their clarion call and meet you near the bridge. Go swiftly!</Description>

  <RewardText>I can hear their song once more. It is a boon on my mind, but the loudest voice remains. We must silence it before it destroys all that we hold dear.</RewardText>
