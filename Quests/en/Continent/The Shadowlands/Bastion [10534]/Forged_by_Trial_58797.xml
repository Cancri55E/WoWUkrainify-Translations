  <Title>Forged by Trial</Title>
  <Description>$n, my friend.

I have thought of you as an ally for some time now. The thrill I felt when you decided to join us in Bastion... I knew you would be a boon unto our ranks.

Our bond has been forged by the trials we face. Without you, I could have fallen to my newfound knowledge as Achillon did.

I wish to cement our bond. I would be honored to soulbind with you.</Description>
