  <Title>Mark of Knowledge</Title>
  <Description>There is another matter for which I need your assistance. My researchers and interrogators have been tirelessly working on the second chamber. So far they don't have any leads.

I need you to speak to them and see if they've made any progress. Tell them, if they have nothing to show, then they will soon find themselves at the end of my sword.

Get me that mark, quartermaster!</Description>
