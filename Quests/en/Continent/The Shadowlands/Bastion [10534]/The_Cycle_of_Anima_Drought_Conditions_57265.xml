  <Title>The Cycle of Anima: Drought Conditions</Title>
  <Description>In days past, keeping a forge burning was a trivial task. The anima extractors could run constantly without ever running dry.

Now, even turning an extractor on is a risk. Etherwyrms, without the anima streams to feed on, are attracted to any source of anima. They are a frequent nuisance.

I am going to ask that you risk their attentions. Activate the extractor and guard it until it can accumulate what little anima remains.

Bring me the product it collects. Let us hope it is enough.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect a Condensed Anima Mote from the Anima Extractor.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That is... somehow more and less than I expected. It will have to do.</RewardText>
