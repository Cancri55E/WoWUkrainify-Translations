  <Title>A Friendly Rivalry</Title>
  <Description>Ah, a fresh soul! Your perspective may prove useful to us.

Nemea and I have opposing viewpoints. She lauds her larion, creatures native to Bastion whom she raises and trains as her companions.

However, I find that phalynx are the superior beings. They are efficient, obedient, and easy to work with.

Please, come learn both of our ways. Perhaps you can decide which of our ways of life is superior.</Description>
