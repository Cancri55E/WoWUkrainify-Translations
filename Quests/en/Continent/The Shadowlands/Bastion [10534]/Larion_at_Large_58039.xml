  <Title>Larion at Large</Title>
  <Description>Some larions are more particular about the people they bond with than others.

Lentios is my companion, the larion I trust most with my life. I love the others as well, but he is a part of my soul.

One of my pride, Andira, has posed a struggle for me to bond with. She ran off into the pastures once again, and I fear she's gotten into something she shouldn't have.

Would you mind finding her and bringing her home?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Andira in the Golden Pasture and return her to Nemea's Retreat.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Incredible! It seems Andira has taken a liking to you. Perhaps you would be interested in bonding with her further?</RewardText>
