  <Title>The Work of One's Hands</Title>
  <Description>Too long have my hands been idle!

&lt;Forgelite Sophone smiles warmly at you.&gt;

You cannot know what this means to me, but I might be able to show you. For your aid in restoring my forge, please allow me to craft you a piece of armor.

It will not be an extravagant affair, but through good works we grow to know ourselves better.

I will need your aid once more. Sika and I will guide you on the specifics. All you need to do is listen and do as instructed.

What do you say?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Assist Forgelite Sophone in crafting a piece of armor.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I hope you like it. It is far from my finest work, but it will serve you well while you are here.</RewardText>
