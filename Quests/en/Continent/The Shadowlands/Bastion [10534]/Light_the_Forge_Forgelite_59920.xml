  <Title>Light the Forge, Forgelite</Title>
  <Description>I think we have the materials I will need to light the forge, at long last.

I am afraid the place is in a state of disrepair. Between failed attempts at working without anima and simple neglect, I cannot hope to work the forge as it currently stands.

I would very much appreciate your help to get the place in order while I coax the forge to life once more.</Description>
