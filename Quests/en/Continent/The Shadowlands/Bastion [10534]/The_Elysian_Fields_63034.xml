  <Description>You must travel to Bastion, eternal home of the winged kyrian.

Do not be fooled by their golden fields and shining spires--the kyrian have been weakened by the great anima drought, and face the brink of civil war against their own fallen brethren.

They will benefit greatly from your aid. Seek one known as Kalisthene in your new sanctum, Elysian Hold. She will direct you further.

Pathscribe Roh-Avonavi in the Ring of Transference above can provide transport.</Description>
