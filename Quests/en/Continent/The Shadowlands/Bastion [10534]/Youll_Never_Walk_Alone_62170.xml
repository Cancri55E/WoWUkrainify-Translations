  <Title>You'll Never Walk Alone</Title>
  <Description>&lt;You have stumbled upon some messy notes. Some of the lines seem incomprehensible while others seem melodic.&gt;

Like wind and rain, discord storms my mind, tossing and blowing.
...
I must find the golden skies.
...
Remember, walk on, heart full of hope, and you'll never walk alone.

&lt;It seems as though an aspirant cannot find their way home. You should inform someone at Hero's Rest.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Turn these notes in to Inkiep in Hero's Rest.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ah, these wise words are certainly Eurgon's. I'm happy to report he made it home.</RewardText>
