  <Title>The Eternal Forge</Title>
  <Description>The Forgelite Prime has taken up the mantle of building our new Crest of Ascension.

No ordinary tools or materials will do. He will require Phaestus, Genesis of Aeons, Hammer of the First Forgelite. It sits at the shrine to the First Forgelite in the Eternal Forge.

The Forsworn have taken over this forge to create their own endless centurion army. You must meet Mikanikos at the forge, push back the Forsworn, and retrieve Phaestus for our own uses.</Description>
