  <Title>Welcome to Eternity</Title>
  <Description>Forgive my reaction. You see, the way from Oribos has been closed for quite some time. We did not know if it would ever open again.

I welcome you, noble soul, to Bastion. Your deeds in life have earned you a most glorious fate! You are to become a kyrian, a winged bearer of the dead.

My name is Kleia. It would be an honor to introduce you to our beautiful realm. There is much you must learn before your journey can begin.

Gather yourself. When you are ready, we will venture on.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Kleia.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The Greeter will soon answer all of your questions. That is its purpose, after all.

&lt;Kleia smiles at you.&gt;

I hope you are excited. I certainly am!</RewardText>
