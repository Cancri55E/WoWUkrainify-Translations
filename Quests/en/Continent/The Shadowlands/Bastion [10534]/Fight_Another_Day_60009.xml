  <Title>Fight Another Day</Title>
  <Description>Some of our brethren are still alive in there!

While many were lost in the initial assault, they seem keen on taking any survivors prisoner. I know not what they intend, but given their mastery of corpses we must assume the worst.

Some have already been taken to their necropolis above, but others remain in cages on the ground. Free all you can.</Description>
