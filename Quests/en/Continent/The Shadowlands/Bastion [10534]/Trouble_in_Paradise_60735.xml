  <Title>Trouble in Paradise</Title>
  <Description>I have given your presence here some thought, $n.

It is clear to me that you are no ordinary arrival from Oribos. I do not know why you are here, nor what you hope to achieve. That alone is simply unprecedented.

You must understand... individuals do not merely come to Bastion on a whim. This fate is earned, and those that are chosen for it are uniquely suited to this existence.

So... I ask you... why are you here, truly?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Answer Kleia's question.</LogDescription>

We have heard you, mortal.</RewardText>
