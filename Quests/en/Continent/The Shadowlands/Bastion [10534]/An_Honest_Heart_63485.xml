  <Title>An Honest Heart</Title>
  <Description>If we are to defeat Vorath, we need to amplify the power of the ranseur. But we will not cut corners or impose our will to do it. That lesson has been learned.

However, the kyrian of Bastion are masters of ushering souls to their proper places. Perhaps they would lend a fragment of their power to our cause.

Go to Bastion, and find a way to empower the ranseur.</Description>
