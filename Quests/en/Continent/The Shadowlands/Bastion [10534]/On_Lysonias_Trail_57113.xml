  <Title>On Lysonia's Trail</Title>
  <Description>Our scouts have reported spotting Lysonia and Uther en route to the Temple of Humility.

As the de facto leader of the Forsworn, we must not allow her to stand free, twisting the minds of those around her.

The disciples of Humility have not answered our beckons. I have sent Kleia ahead to reconnoiter. Meet her outside the temple.</Description>
