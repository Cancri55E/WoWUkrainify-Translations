  <Title>Shards of the Countess</Title>
  <Description>The venthyr travel long distances through enchanted mirrors. The keys we look for are not as we have in Bastion, but rather shards of a mirror that will lead to the sinstone's location.

Primrose, Darkvein, and Sinfang.

Go to their manors and retrieve the shards. We will find the frame to piece them into.</Description>
