  <Title>Suggested Reading</Title>
  <Description>Greetings. You must be the new aspirant everyone is talking about.

I thought you might like to learn more about us. There are three tomes that would serve you well as a starting point, but they are not currently in the library.

Aspirant Leda was the last to hold "Worlds Beyond Counting." Aspirant Ikaran has yet to return "The Infinite Treatises."

It seems "Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code" went missing some time ago. I would search the village.

Once returned, you can read them at your leisure.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve "The Infinite Treatises", "Worlds Beyond Counting", and "Bear Witness: The Watcher's Code."</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I will see that they are returned to their proper places for everyone to enjoy.

I appreciate your help in retrieving them, and I hope they were informative.</RewardText>
