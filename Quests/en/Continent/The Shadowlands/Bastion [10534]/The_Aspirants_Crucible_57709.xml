  <Title>The Aspirant's Crucible</Title>
  <Description>I have given Kalisthene's words some thought.

If you are to learn our ways, we should proceed as if you were an aspirant yourself. The next step is to journey through the Aspirant's Crucible.

It is a place of reflection, training, and cleansing. For an aspirant, it is where they prepare for the long journey ahead. For you... I hope you will learn how you might help us in this time of crisis.

Word of your arrival has likely spread. We will not keep them waiting.

Take my steed, and go in service.</Description>
