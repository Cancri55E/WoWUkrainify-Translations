  <Title>The Temple of Purity</Title>
  <Description>Greetings.

I am Kosmas, Disciple to the Temple of Purity.

The temple is a place of cleansing. Its sole purpose is to free aspirants of the burdens they carry with them from life. It is a place of quiet reflection even for those who have shed their burdens.

Of late, those who look to us for purification have grown numerous. My fellow disciples are stretched terribly thin. I have come to ask the aid of all able-minded aspirants.

Your help is needed. Please report to the Hand of Purity at once.</Description>
