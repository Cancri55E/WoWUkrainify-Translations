  <Title>Who Are You Fooling?</Title>
  <Description>We cannot conduct the ritual without a very special guest. He's a silkstrider larva named Grubby and he's my best friend.

Unfortunately, the nasty spriggans took him! What's worse is they cast illusions on what they steal, so no one can take it back!

The spriggans often carry trickster powder. If you can take some of that stuff, I can reverse their illusions and rescue Grubby.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Loot Sicklethorn Trickster Powder from Sicklethorn spriggans to dispel illusions on Conspicuous Objects and find Grubby.</LogDescription>
