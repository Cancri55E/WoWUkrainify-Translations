  <Title>Trial of Ascension</Title>
  <Description>The Forsworn threat is ever looming, and our forces are dwindling. Now, more than ever, we need more Ascended.

Our generous Archon has blessed us with a portion of our anima stores to ascend our top aspirants to join our forces.

Kleia is amongst the chosen, and thus must complete her final trial.

As Pelagos is not yet prepared to ascend, I request you be Kleia's partner for this process. It is arduous and should not be embarked on alone.

She must bear her first soul.</Description>
