  <Title>Evil Grubbies</Title>
  <Description>Oh no! This place is littered with mites!

They are cute like Grubby, but they grow into horrible gorm! If we cleared some of them out, then the Sylvari will have less to fight against later.

They can burrow away, so it's best to burn them up with Pelagos' red seeds. They'll be good for something after all.</Description>
