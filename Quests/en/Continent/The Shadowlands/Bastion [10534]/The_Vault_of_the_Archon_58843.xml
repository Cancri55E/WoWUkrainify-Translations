  <Title>The Vault of the Archon</Title>
  <Description>Behind me is the entrance to the Vault of the Archon. As you can see, it is warded against all unauthorized intrusion.

To make yourself an authorized entrant, place the offerings you collected before the guardians. You may then browse the contents of the vault at your leisure.

Do consider that such access is coveted among the Forsworn and is the sole focus of their efforts here. I advise preparing for combat.</Description>
