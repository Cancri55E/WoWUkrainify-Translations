  <Title>Settling Disputes</Title>
  <Description>In my search to find kyrian that would fit our purposes here, I have landed on two in particular -- Pelodis and Nemea.

However, the two are involved in quite the rivalry, and struggle to focus their attention elsewhere. I propose that you aid them in settling their dispute so that they may focus on the task at hand.

I doubt they shall work together, however, so you will need to pick one to aid us.</Description>
