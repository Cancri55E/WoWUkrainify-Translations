  <Title>The Prime's Directive</Title>
  <Description>All centurion are made to serve the kyrian.

That they now work against ME, the Forgelite PRIME, is an insult to all centurions in Bastion. Look at them! Praetors! Goliaths! All... PURPLE!

I hereby give you permission and expressly order you to extract their cores. I will repurpose them in a fitting manner. I will reclaim their anima to power the Locus.

I can build more. Do not pity.</Description>
