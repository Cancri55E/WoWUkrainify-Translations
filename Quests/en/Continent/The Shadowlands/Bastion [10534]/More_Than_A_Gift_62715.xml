&lt;She opens the parcel to reveal a wreath of Larion plumage.&gt;

I will explain, but first... I wish to return the favor.

Klystere and I frequent a resting place to the north of here, along the path to the Temple of Courage. We planted a flower for our enjoyment, as we spend so much of our free time there.

Bring me this bloom, if you would be so kind. Then I will tell you about the significance of this gift.</Description>
