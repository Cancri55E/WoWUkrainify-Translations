  <Title>Light Respite</Title>
  <Description>We passed many ash ghouls on the way here, screaming in pain from their Light-dispensed burns.

And after meeting Alwin and the others here, my heart aches for them.

They have lost much of who they once were, and suffer daily for it.

Please, collect some berries from the Ashen Traverse. I believe I could impart anima into them to create a healing salve to soothe their wounds.

It is the least I can do.</Description>
