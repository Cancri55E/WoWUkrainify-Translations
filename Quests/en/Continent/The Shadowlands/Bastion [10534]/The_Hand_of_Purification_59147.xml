  <Title>The Hand of Purification</Title>
  <Description>Nikolon was not alone.

&lt;Eridia stares grimly out over the temple grounds.&gt;

Long have I toiled over the aspirants in my care. Long have I tended to this temple under my Paragon. To know that so many have fallen, alone, is a blow.

But this... wanton destruction! It will not stand.

You will be my hand, $n. Go forth. End them. All of them.

My duty demands that I tend to those that remain. I will find you near the bridge when the way is clear.</Description>
