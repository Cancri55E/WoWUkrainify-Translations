  <Title>Assessing Your Strength</Title>
  <Description>The trial to come will test you in ways you can likely only imagine.

I can see both from your past and from your demeanor that you are no stranger to combat. I would like to know where your strengths lie so we may address any weaknesses we find before your trial.

You will find three praetorian soldiers created for this purpose, each stronger than the last.

Defeat them all and I will consider your strength sufficient to continue at this time.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat the 3 Praetorian Sparring Assistants.</LogDescription>
