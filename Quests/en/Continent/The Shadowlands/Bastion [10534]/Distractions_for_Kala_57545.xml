  <Title>Distractions for Kala</Title>
  <Description>When the animals became aggravated, we left in a hurry. However, all of Kala's toys are still inside the garden.

Since you are going to be there, would you please collect them? Kala may be very large, but she is still young. She can be a bit of a troublemaker as well.

Hopefully the return of her toys will help keep her distracted.</Description>
