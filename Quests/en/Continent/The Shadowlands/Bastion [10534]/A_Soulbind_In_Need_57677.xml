  <Title>A Soulbind In Need</Title>
  <Description>Pelagos is my Soulbind. He is my brother, my closest friend, my mentor, and my student. He knows me completely, and I him. It is a bond stronger than any other.

That he now struggles is a torment to me, but I am forbidden from intervening. An aspirant must succeed or fail on their own merits, or the trial is forfeit.

I am bound by this law... but you are not.

Please bring Pelagos back to me. This will not be his last trial. Not when he may finally have a chance.</Description>
