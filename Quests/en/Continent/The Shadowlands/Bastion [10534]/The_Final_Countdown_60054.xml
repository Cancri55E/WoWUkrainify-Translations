  <Title>The Final Countdown</Title>
  <Description>If the necromancer's brood descends upon us fully before the colossus is charged, we will perish. There is no question.

We must keep his attention until Mikanikos's work is complete.

He believes that the day is already won -- that we are pawns to be toyed with. We can use his hubris to our advantage to buy precious seconds.

May it be enough.</Description>
