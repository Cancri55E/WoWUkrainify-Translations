  <Title>Seeds Away!</Title>
  <Description>I think we have a problem. Plucking the seed from this root must have shaken some burrowed gorm awake. This isn't good!

Grab on to me. I will fly us out of here, but we must stop the gorm before they overrun the local Vorkai defenses!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Stop the gorm from overrunning the Gormhive Defense Wall and then pouring into the rest of Ardenweald!</LogDescription>
