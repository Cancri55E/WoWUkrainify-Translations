  <Description>This Anima Conflux is completely drained of anima! Just a heavy hunk of metal!

Not your fault, of course. Not at all. But we need to charge it!

The Maldraxxi have extractors. Big green crystals, can't miss them. They're using it to drain anima from fallen kyrian. Very bad!

We can use them to charge the conflux, then our colossus here will be functional again!</Description>
