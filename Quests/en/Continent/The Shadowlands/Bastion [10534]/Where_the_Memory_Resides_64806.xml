  <Title>Where the Memory Resides</Title>
  <Description>I think I know what will be asked of us in Bastion. It will not be easy.

With this half of the Helm, we have collected the first part of what is needed to resist Domination. But there are those of us who have also suffered from it. Lived through it. 

In a way, it has marked us. All of us.

There must be something in those experiences that will help us break free from Zovaal's influence.

Let us go to the Chamber of First Reflection in Bastion.</Description>

  <RewardText>Good, you've arrived.

We have assembled those who have suffered from Domination in the past. Some more recently than others. 

All have come through it, not always intact, but we are still standing. That is what we must capture.</RewardText>
