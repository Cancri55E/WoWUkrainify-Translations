  <Title>Walk the Path, Aspirant</Title>
  <Description>If you wish to stand before the Archon, there is a path you must walk. Thankfully, it is well worn and serviceable even in these dire times.

Though you are not destined to become kyrian, our ways may be of interest to you. Learn well, learn fast, and perhaps the Archon will take notice and grant you this audience you seek.

Aspirant Kleia will show you the way. Archon's eyes upon you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel with Kleia.</LogDescription>
