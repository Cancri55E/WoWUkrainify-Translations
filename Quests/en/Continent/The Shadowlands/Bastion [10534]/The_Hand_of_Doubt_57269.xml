  <Title>The Hand of Doubt</Title>
  <Description>Quickly! We have no time to lose. Lysonia has weakened Eridia to the point that she may fall. Our Paragon will do what she can, but we must intervene.

We will challenge Lysonia, and perhaps buy Eridia more time. 

This so-called Hand of Doubt will make no easy foe. Stand ready, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat Lysonia, Hand of Doubt.</LogDescription>
