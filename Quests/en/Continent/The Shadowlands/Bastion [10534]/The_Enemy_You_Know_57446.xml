  <Title>The Enemy You Know</Title>
  <Description>My heart is filled with dread. If it truly is Lysonia who leads them now...

No. What is important is that we restore the great vespers. So long as their mighty voices are corrupted, all who hear them will suffer as this temple does. It is only a matter of time before all of Bastion succumbs.

They will no doubt try to stop you. I will hold their leader's attention as long as I can.

If I do not survive... my disciple will see you safely from this place. Go in service.</Description>
