  <Title>The Things That Haunt Us</Title>
  <Description>As you will soon learn, a ritual cleansing can be a... painful process.

In most cases, the upwelling of emotion is harmless. It can even generate anima under the right circumstances.

However... sometimes the result is far less pleasant. Negative memories can take a form of their own and manifest in a violent fashion.

I fear Pelagos' attempt at cleansing has brought forth such monsters. You must destroy them, and quickly.</Description>
