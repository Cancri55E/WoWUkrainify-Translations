  <Title>Mnemis, At Your Service</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, I am Locus-Keeper Mnemis and I would be delighted to assist you.

I recall that you are trying to access a particular memory. Due to the contents, that memory can only be viewed within the Vault of the Archon.

In order to gain access to the Vault, you must collect offerings for the two guardians who watch over it. I have hidden these offerings from the Forsworn, as they are not authorized to enter.

The Forgelite Prime is the only one among you who can grant authorization. How convenient!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate two offerings within the Walk of Recollection, then proceed to the Vault of the Archon.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak to Locus-Keeper Mnemis at the Vault of the Archon.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Your search was fruitful. I am delighted to see you remain intact.</RewardText>
