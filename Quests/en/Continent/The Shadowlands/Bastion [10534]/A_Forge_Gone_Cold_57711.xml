  <Title>A Forge Gone Cold</Title>
  <Description>I have seen firsthand that you are a most capable soul.

Kleia has told me of your purpose here. She has spoken of the hopes she places in you. I am not yet certain if I am ready to do the same.

There is one small task that I would set before you, however. My forge has grown cold without anima to keep it burning bright. I long to practice my craft again.

My helper, whom you have met before, can elaborate on our needs.

You will find Sika near the forge. I will follow shortly.</Description>
