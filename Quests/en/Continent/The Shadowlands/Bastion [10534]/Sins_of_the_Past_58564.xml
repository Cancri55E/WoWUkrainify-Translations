  <Title>Sins of the Past</Title>
  <Description>The Countess built her reputation on being a native venthyr, never a soul.

Revealing her sinstone to the world would be catastrophic. This is the leverage we need for the information we seek.

She will tell us where Alwin is. Where the seal is.

This mirror leads to her estate. I will follow behind you as backup, but the kyrian shall wait here.

Don't let her threaten you. You hold the power.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Go through the mirror and face the Countess.</LogDescription>
