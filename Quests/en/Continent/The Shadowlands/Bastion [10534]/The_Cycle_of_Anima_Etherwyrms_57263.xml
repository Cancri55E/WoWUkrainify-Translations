  <Title>The Cycle of Anima: Etherwyrms</Title>
  <Description>Forge is cold, yes? Need LOTS of anima to light.

&lt;Sika references her scroll.&gt;

Times before now, anima is everywhere, yes? Now it hides. Small bits, weird places.

We know that etherwyrms -- flappy scale-things that are blue -- eat anima. They are not dead, so they are finding anima to eat still, yes?

Maybe if we take what they have eaten, we can use it to light the forge. This will probably kill them.

Sad, yes. But! We will not take too much. Just a little.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Etherwyrms to collect $1oa Glowing Viscera.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Sika pokes the squishy substance.&gt;

It glows. This means anima. Forgelite will be pleased.</RewardText>
