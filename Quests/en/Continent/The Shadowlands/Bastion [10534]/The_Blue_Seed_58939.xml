  <Title>The Blue Seed</Title>
  <Description>I remember seeing a blue seed with red leaves nearby, but it was in a cave behind a wall of brambles. I didn't think of it at the time, but maybe you could use the red seeds to get us in?

I wish I didn't mix up the instructions or we wouldn't be in this mess. But maybe it's all going to work out anyway. Let's go!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find the cave entrance, get through the blockage of brambles, and obtain the Ripened Anima Seed.</LogDescription>
