  <Title>Time to Reflect</Title>
  <Description>I knew that Devos had powerful allies. I turned a blind eye. When Lysonia took her place... I was blinded by my loyalty.

I have much to reflect on.

We may not be allies, but I have one request. Please, escort me from this wretched place. I will leave you be... but do not leave me here in the Maw.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Kleia to exit the Maw, then return to Polemarch Adrestes in Elysian Hold.</LogDescription>
