  <Title>The First Cleansing</Title>
  <Description>This situation may feel familiar, $n.

When you found Pelagos, he was undergoing a similar rite. As you saw, it can end in violence.

This will be the first time you are asked to draw out the burdens that held you to a mortal life. It may be a painful process. It is for many.

For you, this is the path you must walk to attain your goals. To earn the right to stand among us, to be heard. So we may carry your message to the Archon herself.

Center yourself. When you are prepared, we will begin.</Description>
