  <Title>Tough Love</Title>
  <Description>Heavens! Kala has flown off with Korinna's Allaying Crook!

I saw her fly into her den to the west. I must warn you, she can become very protective when she's in there. Please be careful, but do not be afraid to give her some tough love. She is exceptionally resilient.

Here, take her slobber ball. It's her favorite and may help to distract her.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>We need to be stern but gentle. Maybe her slobber ball will provide the proper distraction.</PortraitGiverText>
