  <Title>What We Wish to Forget</Title>
  <Description>While the language of the Progenitors will aid us, there is another trait that will help break Domination's hold on us.

An indomitable will. 

Those of us who have endured before, and survived, have that inherent resistance, which we will offer up to be infused into each of the shards.

The Primus has assured me that this will work. With no other options, this is the only way. 

I trust that it will be worth the suffering.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Assist with the ritual and infuse the Shards of Domination.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I feel... lighter. But I cannot forget what has brought me to here, and what must still be done.

I hope that Taelia will remember what she saw... the man I am now. Not some lone figure locked away, but someone who does what is necessary for the good of all.</RewardText>
