  <Title>What We Overcome</Title>
  <Description>I understand now. All of us that were touched by Domination were able to tap into something. Whether nobility or vengeance, it gave the strength to resist.

With all that I have faced, I have to remember that I am still here.

And if there are those willing to stand with Sylvanas, I have to believe they will stand with me as well.

I'm ready to try again. This time, I will overcome whatever I face.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat the Mawbound Monstrosity and infuse the final shard.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>All the shards are now infused with the resistance we gained from our experiences with Domination.

It was not easy, for any of us. But I am proud of what we were able to accomplish, together.

As for the rest, our future is in the hands of the Primus.</RewardText>
