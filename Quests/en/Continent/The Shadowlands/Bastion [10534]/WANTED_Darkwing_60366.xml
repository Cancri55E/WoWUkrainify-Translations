  <Title>WANTED: Darkwing</Title>
  <Description>The Cloudfeather matriarch, Darkwing, has fallen to a great and terrible sickness. She has grown aggressive, dominating her children and driving them to violence.

Darkwing must be slain if her flock is to ever return to the Archon's grace.

Please use the attached whistle to call her to her nest. I shall consider one of her crown feathers sufficient proof of the deed.
