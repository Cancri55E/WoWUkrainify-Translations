  <Title>Getting Backstage</Title>
  <Description>The next thing we need to prepare the vessel is a set of Night's Veil Flowers.

We use these flowers in our ceremonies, but since the drought we've just used them as props in our plays. There are certainly some backstage at the Star Lake Amphitheater.

I bet Moonberry is there for the rehearsal of their next play. As a bonus, this will work out quite nicely for me to get revenge on her.
