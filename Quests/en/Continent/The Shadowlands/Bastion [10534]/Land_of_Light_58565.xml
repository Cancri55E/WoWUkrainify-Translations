  <Title>Land of Light</Title>
  <Description>The Ember Ward is filled with outcasts from Revendreth society, whether they rebelled, crossed a noble, or simply looked at Denathrius wrong.

It is a Light-scorched land that drives venthyr mad, unless they manage to stay within the shadows.

If Alwin is there, it may be too late.

Let us visit Theotar at the Sanctuary of the Mad. I'm sure he will be pleased to see you.</Description>
