  <Title>The Mnemonic Locus</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Mikanikos examines the scroll you retrieved for him.&gt;

Soul mirrors and Locus are tied together. If we restore anima to mirrors, it should repair the Locus back to full functionality. Thankfully, the cores you brought should be sufficient.

All I need to do is enable conduits. Simple!

Well? Go on. You know how to use these, yes?</Description>
