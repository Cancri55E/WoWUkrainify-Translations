  <Title>Assistance from Sinfall</Title>
  <Description>In order to defeat the Forsworn, the Crest needs an artifact that embodies repentance, atoning for past mistakes and moving forward.

I have an artifact in mind. 

Long ago, many souls from Revendreth arrived in Bastion. Purer souls than we have ever received from Revendreth.

They bore the mark of the Seal of Contrition, a focus that expedited their cleansing.

Go to Revendreth and find this seal so that we may harness its power.</Description>
