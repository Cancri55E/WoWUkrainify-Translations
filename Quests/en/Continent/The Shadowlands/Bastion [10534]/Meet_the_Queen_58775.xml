  <Title>Meet the Queen</Title>
  <Description>$n, we need only one more piece to complete the Crest of Ascension.

Eons ago, our Crest was originally crafted with the assistance of the fae. Deep within Ardenweald lies a portal they maintain to ferry souls back to their worlds. It is a source of great power and the final key to rebuilding the Crest.

Seek out the Winter Queen in Ardenweald and plead our case. We've already sent Pelagos ahead as our envoy to arrange for your meeting.</Description>
