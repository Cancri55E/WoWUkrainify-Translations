  <Description>Do you feel it, $n?

That cold hand that grips your throat? That chill settled in the pit of your stomach? That is the touch of the Maw, as certain as the Archon's will.

I do not know how Lysonia came to possess this power, but we must act quickly.

I will inform the Archon of what transpired here. You will act where my Hand could not. I will explain as we fly.

Speak to me when you are prepared to leave the temple.</Description>
