  <Description>Ah yes, the Greeter.

It seems this Mnemis unit has been deactivated. Anima has been so scarce of late, and with no new souls entering our gates... I suppose it was a prudent measure. Anima is our most precious resource, after all.

There are some centurions nearby. A portion of their anima could serve our needs.

Ah! One of our most helpful stewards is here to lend her aid. She will guide you in the collection effort.

Return when you have sufficient anima and we will power the Greeter once more.</Description>
