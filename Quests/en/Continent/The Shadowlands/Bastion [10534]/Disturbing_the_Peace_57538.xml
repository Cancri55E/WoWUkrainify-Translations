  <Title>Disturbing the Peace</Title>
  <Description>This anima drought isn't hard on just the kyrian. The wildlife of Bastion are suffering too!

Many creatures are becoming aggressive and menacing, wyrms and cloudfeathers especially. They are hurting the other wildlife and long beyond saving.

If someone doesn't clear this garden of these starved creatures, we can no longer meditate here. And if we can no longer meditate, that will make the anima shortage even worse!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa Anima-Starved creatures.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We can now better fulfill our duties here. I look forward to resuming my meditations. Thank you.</RewardText>
