  <Title>Stay Scrappy</Title>
  <Description>I can rebuild this colossus's core systems, but a few things are beyond repair. Thankfully there were enough centurions present here that I believe we can improvise.

Replacements are in order!

I require an Anima Conflux to charge its systems, some Eternity Plating to protect its core, and an Archonic Resonator to make it go boom!

I'll take care of the rest. Quickly, now!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover the Anima Conflux, Eternity Plating, and Archonic Resonator.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That was fast! Well done, well done indeed!</RewardText>
