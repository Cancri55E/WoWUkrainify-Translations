  <Title>Chasing a Memory</Title>
  <Description>The attack on the Temple of Purity is unprecedented in Bastion. At least, to my knowledge.

We need to know more. The fragment that the Paragon captured may contain the answers we seek.

There is a place nearby called the Mnemonic Locus. There, aspirants and ascended alike can call forth their memories and store them away. If we can look through this fragment's memories, perhaps we can learn more about the so-called Forsworn and, with luck, uncover their plan.

I will meet you there. Go in service.</Description>
