  <Description>I have had it with this insolence!

I have an idea to reset this Mnemis's personality, but you will need to keep it busy.

It will try to fight you, through whatever means it posseses. I suggest you try not to perish. Kleia can hold her own, so hide behind her if so inclined.

Hop to it!</Description>
