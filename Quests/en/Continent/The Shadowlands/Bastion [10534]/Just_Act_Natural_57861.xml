  <Description>With this disguise you will blend right in. I... know a Forsworn artificer on the inside who should prove useful. You need to remain convincing, however.

The most important thing is to get to Kalliope's spear before the Forsworn manage to do so. The shrine has many defenses, but it's only a matter of time before they find it.

I am somewhat ashamed. Many of the aspirants here used to be friends. So much has been lost.</Description>
