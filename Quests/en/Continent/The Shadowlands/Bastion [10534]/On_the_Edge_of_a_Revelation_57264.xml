  <Title>On the Edge of a Revelation</Title>
  <Description>Ah! Good. You answered the call.

As you can see, there are many aspirants who require our aid. Myself and the other disciples are hard pressed to deal with all of them. Some are in greater need than others.

Aspirants are most at risk when they are on the precipice of a revelation. It is a critical moment that we cannot allow to pass without intervention.

You must push them, one way or another.

Find the most vulnerable among your peers and do what you can to help them find the path forward.</Description>
