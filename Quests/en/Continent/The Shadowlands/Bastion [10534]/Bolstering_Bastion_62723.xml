  <Title>Bolstering Bastion</Title>
  <Description>You are no aspirant, but I welcome any aid that Oribos might bring us in these dire times.

Please, aid our people in any way you can. With anima in low supply and the insidious Forsworn encroaching from all sides, there is no shortage of trials to overcome.

Do this for us, and I will see to it myself that our almighty Archon hears of your deeds in service of the kyrian. Mark well my words, and follow the path.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Aid Bastion by completing Side Quests, Bonus Objectives, World Quests, and slaying rare creatures. You may also defeat powerful foes in Bastion dungeons.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Word has spread across Bastion of your deeds since your arrival here.

You have proven yourself a worthy ally of the kyrian. Take this gift in thanks, and go in service.

May we cross paths again soon.</RewardText>
