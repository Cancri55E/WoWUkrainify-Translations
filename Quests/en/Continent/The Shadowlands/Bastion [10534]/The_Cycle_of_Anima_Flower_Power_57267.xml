  <Title>The Cycle of Anima: Flower Power</Title>
  <Description>For forge to light, need more anima. Always more. Never too much, for forge!

&lt;Sika consults her scroll and nods vigorously as she reads.&gt;

Out in fields, there is a glowy flower. The round thing inside. Bulb? It glows. So, has anima. From the ground, we think.

According to scrolls, it is called Adrima's Lily. We do not know who Adrima is. But the lily is good.

Get flowers, too. Not just bulbs. Petals make stewards happy, too. 

Thank you!</Description>
