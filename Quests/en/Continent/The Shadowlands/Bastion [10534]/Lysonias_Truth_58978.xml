  <Title>Lysonia's Truth</Title>
  <Description>If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I do not know that I would believe such a thing is possible.

You carry a significant piece of Lysonia within you, now. Go to the Soul Mirrors and open yourself to them. With luck, they will draw from her essence to draw forth a memory of the Forsworn.

If this works, we may know what they are planning within minutes!</Description>
