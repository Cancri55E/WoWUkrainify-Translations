  <Title>The True Crucible Awaits</Title>
  <Description>I confess, $n. I had little hope when you first arrived.

Kleia is convinced that your presence here is a sign of things finally improving in Bastion. I was... skeptical.

You are not most.

Kleia and Pelagos will tell you more. They await you near the sparring grounds.</Description>
