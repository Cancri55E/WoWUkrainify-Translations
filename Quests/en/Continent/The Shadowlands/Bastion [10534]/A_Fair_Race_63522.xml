  <Description>A soul that refuses to cross the veil is a problem we kyrian are familiar with. I can help you.

But before I grant your weapon this power, I must know that you will not abuse it, and that your heart is true.

Let us run a race. Along the course, ring the bells. If your heart is pure, they will aid your speed. You must have at least five bells recently rung in order to complete the race.

Do not be distracted by shortcuts. And do not try to cheat to get ahead, it will not work.
