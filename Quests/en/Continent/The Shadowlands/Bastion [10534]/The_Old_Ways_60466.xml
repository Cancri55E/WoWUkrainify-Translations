  <Description>You there! Might I ask your help?

I must confess, with the lack of new souls arriving, our supplies have dwindled. We lack the means to clothe arrivals in proper kyrian attire.

Before the forging of the centurions, aspirants trained against the native wildlife. Perhaps there is another way these beasts can prove useful.

If you collect materials from the cloudstriders and larions nearby, we can use them to ensure our new arrivals look the part.

Oh, and some thread from Mirene, if you would!</Description>
