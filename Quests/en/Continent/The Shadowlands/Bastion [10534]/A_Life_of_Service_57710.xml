  <Title>A Life of Service</Title>
  <Description>Curious. You are unlike any aspirant that has come before, that much is certain.

You will notice that we have an audience. It has been a long time indeed since we welcomed another to the path. We are all eager to see what deeds brought you to us.

Simply approach the dais before you and gaze into the flame. The Watcher will pull forth your memories of those you served in life, and you will be transported back to those moments to aid them once more.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Witness memories of your past life.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I confess... I was hoping for a small spectacle to lift the spirits of the aspirants in my care.

I was not expecting to have my own lifted, as well. Thank you for that.</RewardText>
