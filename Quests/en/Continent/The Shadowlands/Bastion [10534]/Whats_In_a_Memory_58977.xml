  <Title>What's In a Memory?</Title>
  <Description>It may be possible to extract memories from fragment, but I worry they will not be useful. This is not whole kyrian, but a tiny piece! A weird, broken piece. It cannot even speak!

We will apply extractor and see what comes out. Extractor might explode. It might not. For this? Worth the risk, I think.

Do not know what will emerge. Could be memories. Could be nothing. Could be something else. May try to fight you! Stay on your guard, yes? Collect all that look Forsworn.

Speak when ready.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect memories of the Forsworn from the Fragment of Lysonia.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We did it. With any luck, her memories are within our grasp.</RewardText>
