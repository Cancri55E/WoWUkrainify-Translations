  <Title>A Test of Courage</Title>
  <Description>I'm still new and haven't passed all of my Aspirant tests. But, I have an idea.

There is an artifact called Korinna's Allaying Crook. Korinna was a powerful Ascended who tamed the creatures of Bastion eons ago. Her staff has the power to prevent more creatures from succumbing to a savage, anima-starved state.

However, the artifact is protected and only one with great courage can retrieve it. I bet you could, $n.

Go on ahead. The staff is in the reliquary to the north. I'll join you there shortly.</Description>
