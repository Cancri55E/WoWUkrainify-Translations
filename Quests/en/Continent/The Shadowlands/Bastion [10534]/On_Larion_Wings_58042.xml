  <Title>On Larion Wings</Title>
  <Description>As a flightless being, you will unfortunately never feel the joy of flying alongside your companion.

However... you could still fly with Andira.

It seems you have earned Andira's trust more than I've seen her with anybody else. Would you like to try a flight course?

Take wing with Andira, then fly through the rings. Don't stray off course or take too much time to get between rings or she will leave you behind!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Mount Andira, then complete the flight course.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The feeling of soaring through the air, the gentle flap of your larion's wings...

Even though I have my own wings, there's no feeling quite like it.</RewardText>
