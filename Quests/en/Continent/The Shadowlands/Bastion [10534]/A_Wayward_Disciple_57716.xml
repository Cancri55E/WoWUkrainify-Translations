  <Title>A Wayward Disciple?</Title>
  <Description>While you are here and as yet unaffected by this--rash of doubt, we shall call it--there is one other errand I would ask of you.

I sent one of the disciples to investigate reports of the fallen fleeing our temple. For their own safety, they must be taken to the Temple of Loyalty.

Disciple Nikolon has yet to return. If he is to be found nearby, it will be near the border of our temple to the north.

Please, seek him out and ensure that he is not injured or in peril.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate Disciple Nikolon.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you for bringing him to me, $n. He is in a worse state than any of us might have guessed.</RewardText>
