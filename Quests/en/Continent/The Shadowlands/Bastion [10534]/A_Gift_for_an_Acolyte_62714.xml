  <Title>A Gift for an Acolyte</Title>
  <Description>The materials you supplied were more than sufficient for my purposes. For that, you have my gratitude.

I think I know how to make the best use of the excess.

A dear friend of mine recently achieved the role of Acolyte in service to the Temple of Purity. You are new here, so I will spare you the details, but it is an honor to serve a temple before one reaches ascension.

I want to celebrate her success with a gift. Will you take this parcel to Acolyte Amalthina?</Description>

This is wonderful. Thank you.</RewardText>
