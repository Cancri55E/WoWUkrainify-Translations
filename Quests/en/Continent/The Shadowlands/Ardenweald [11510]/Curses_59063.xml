  <Title>Curses!</Title>
  <Description>Oh, dear me, this is terrible! Just terrible!

I know precisely which awful curse afflicts that poor soul! But these damnable spriggans keep stealing my scrolls, scattering them all over and ripping them apart! 

Now the falls are overrun with all manner of dangerous magic!

The spriggans have the pieces of the scroll you need. Gather them along with a binding from one of the major hexes, and you can put it all back together.</Description>
