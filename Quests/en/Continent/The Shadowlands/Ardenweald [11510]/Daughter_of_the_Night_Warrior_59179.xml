  <Title>Daughter of the Night Warrior</Title>
  <Description>In my dreams, I see many things. Elven souls tortured in the Maw. A warrior of the night consumed by vengeance.

And... Ardenweald's destruction.

These visions are ever shifting... ever vague. But I believe Tyrande Whisperwind is key to saving the night elves, as well as this realm.

Shandris Feathermoon, Tyrande's daughter, is touched by dreams as well.

Even now, she travels to the Eternal City. Find her. If anyone can reach the heart of Tyrande, it is her.</Description>
