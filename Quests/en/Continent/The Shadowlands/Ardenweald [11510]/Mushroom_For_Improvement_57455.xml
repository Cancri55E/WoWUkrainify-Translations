  <Title>Mushroom For Improvement</Title>
  <Description>The mushrooms are under attack! I need your help, or we risk losing it all!

Some fae wearing strange masks came in and demanded to gain access to the rings. When I told them they were closed due to the drought, they attacked me!

I'm too weak to fight back now, and I'm cut off from the center ring. These fae have destroyed so much, but there is something we can do.

Sprinkle some of these spores on their corpses so we can regrow the rings. Even when slain, our enemies can still serve Ardenweald.</Description>
