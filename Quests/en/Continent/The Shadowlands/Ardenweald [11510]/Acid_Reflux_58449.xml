  <Title>Acid Reflux</Title>
  <Description>We will need to be properly prepared before we can face Voras.

The digestive juices of Ardenweald's gorm dissipate the anima in their food. Ingesting them causes devourers no small discomfort.

For a beast of that size, we will need a lot of it to have any effect. There should be plenty of gorm in the hive to the east.

Long ago, an artisan gave me a tool that he said would be useful against the gorm, should I ever need it. You may borrow it.</Description>
