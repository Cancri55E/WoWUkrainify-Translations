  <Title>Take What You Can</Title>
  <Description>We know that these invaders have taken over the remains of the grove. 

But why? Why are they gathering anima and bringing it all to one place?

And how did they enter Ardenweald?

We should stay alert and take as much anima as we can find. Perhaps some good can come out of all this loss.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take Plundered Anima from stores in Tirna Noch.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This anima will help Dreamweaver complete his ritual... and perhaps save spirits who otherwise would have been lost.

Good work.</RewardText>
