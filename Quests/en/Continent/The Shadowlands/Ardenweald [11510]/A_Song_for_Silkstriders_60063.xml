  <Title>A Song for Silkstriders</Title>
  <Description>There, the harp is fixed. I am too injured to take it to the silkstriders, but you are strong. You can help them.

Our precious silkstriders are all across the cliffs. When you find one, play the harp for them, and they will give you fresh silk. Make sure that there is nothing nearby to stress them out first though!

If you find yourself in need of a way to move about swiftly, just take a Silk Shooter there, next to me. Aim it where you want to go, and it will shoot silk to pull you there!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect silk from the silkstriders by playing the harp for them.</LogDescription>
