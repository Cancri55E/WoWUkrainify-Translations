  <Title>Ritual of Purification</Title>
  <Description>I have finished making preparations for the ritual. The moment of truth has come.

The Drust fetish that Ulfar gave you will channel the ritual's power into Gweyir. It should counteract the curse that imprisons her mind.
 
This will not be pleasant. It may not even work. But this is the only chance we have to free her.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Complete the Ritual of Purification.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You performed the ritual admirably, but the Gorak Zhar's power was too strong for Gweyir to withstand. There is nothing more we can do, I am afraid.

It seems the masked fae are lost to us after all...</RewardText>
