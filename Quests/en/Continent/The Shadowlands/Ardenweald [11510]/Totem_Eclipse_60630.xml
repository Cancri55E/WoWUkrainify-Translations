  <Title>Totem Eclipse</Title>
  <Description>I can smell our foes' dark magic, twisting the air and muddling my mind. They are up to something. Bringing awful powers into Ardenweald.

If you see any of their totems, destroy them immediately. 

I always feel better after smashing something to pieces, don't you?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy Foul Totems.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>If it was not clear before, it is now. This is a personal hunt.

We will rid Ardenweald of this monster.</RewardText>
