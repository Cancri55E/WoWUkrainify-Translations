  <Title>He's Drust in the Way</Title>
  <Description>Only the heart of a grove can hold the sheer massive quantity of anima I'm sensing. 

When my grove was sacrificed, the anima within its heart was reclaimed. Now it brims with anima once again.

Anima that was stolen from other groves.

We must secure the heart not just for our own sake, but for the entire forest.

I suspect that we will not be allowed to simply trot our way in there. Be prepared for anything.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>A true Drust from Thros, Vroth stands between you and the anima stockpile.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Slay Vroth, Bulwark of Thros, and make your way to the Heart of the Fallen Tree.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We made it to the heart. Well done.

If that is what all the Drust are truly like, then Ardenweald is in a dire situation, indeed.</RewardText>
