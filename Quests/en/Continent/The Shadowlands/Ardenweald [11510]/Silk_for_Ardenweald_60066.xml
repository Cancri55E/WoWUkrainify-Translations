  <Title>Silk for Ardenweald</Title>
  <Description>It's clear that we may not be able to consistently supply Ardenweald with silk. But there is something that will help.

Take Gertie Jr. and the silk you collected from the other silkstriders back to the Heart of the Forest. There, she will be safe, and perhaps grow up into a silkstrider as grand and beautiful as her mother!</Description>
