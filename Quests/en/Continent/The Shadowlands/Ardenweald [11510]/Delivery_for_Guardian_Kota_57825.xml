  <Title>Delivery for Guardian Kota</Title>
  <Description>This is most disturbing, indeed. The gorm are just too... wild, now!

I wonder if the drought is making everything delicious to them, and that is why.

This isn't enough gorm gris, either. And I do not want to disappoint Kota..

But, I also don't want to put you through more trouble collecting it. I will go myself into the burrows nearby, to see if I can find any more for her.

Would you take this gorm gris to her for me, please?</Description>
