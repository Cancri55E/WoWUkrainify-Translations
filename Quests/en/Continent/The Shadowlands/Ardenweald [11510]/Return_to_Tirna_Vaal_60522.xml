  <Title>Return to Tirna Vaal</Title>
  <Description>We of the Wild Hunt are always prepared to return to the cycle in defense of Ardenweald.

I must move on, and so should you. I advise you to return to Droman Tashmur in Tirna Vaal. Others will need your help.

Here, take this. It is a gift and a thank you.

Helping each other is the only way to survive this drought.</Description>

  <RewardText>Oh, you have a spirit cradle! That will be quite useful, indeed.

Assuming we can calm this chaos, of course. The wildseed you bonded with is having intense nightmares... and they're manifesting all over the grove!</RewardText>
