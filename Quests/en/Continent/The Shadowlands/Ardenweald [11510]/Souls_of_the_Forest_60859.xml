  <Description>If you're standing in for Lady Moonberry, then maybe you can help!

Wagonmaster Derawyn was escorting a bunch of us to a new grove when we were attacked by a pack of hungry predators! The wolf be a fast soulshape, so I got away... but some of the little ones weren't so lucky. They're being hunted like prey!

Come on! They're just down the road!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rescue souls in peril.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It's been a while since a new soul arrived in Ardenweald, so each one already here is precious to us.
