  <Title>On the Trail</Title>
  <Description>In my visions, I witnessed Tyrande cutting through an endless storm of malevolent, nightmarish beings.

Up ahead... is that...? Yes. I believe it is the very place I saw.

Come. It may hold a clue as to where my mother has gone.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Look for signs of Tyrande Whisperwind.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Some vile force in this place intends to stop us from finding Tyrande.

If experience serves, that means we must be on the right track.</RewardText>
