  <Title>Return to Oribos</Title>
  <Description>I wish you could stay and relax here, maybe enjoy a play at the Star Lake Amphitheater, but there's simply no time!

There are other realms out there that need your help, too.

You will always be a friend of the Court, but I'm afraid you must return to Oribos. The Shadowlands needs you!</Description>
