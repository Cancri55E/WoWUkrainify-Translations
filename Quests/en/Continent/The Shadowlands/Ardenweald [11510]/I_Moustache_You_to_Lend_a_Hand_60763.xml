  <Title>I Moustache You to Lend a Hand</Title>
  <Description>A message from the Primus of Maldraxxus, you say? We haven't heard from him in... Well, it's been a long time.

This isn't a prank, is it? The Queen doesn't have time for pranks. But I do!

&lt;Moonberry leans in close and whispers to you.&gt;

And for this one, I think we need one more lily.

&lt;Moonberry winks.&gt;

Let me take a look at this message. You bring that last night lily to Featherlight, and then we'll talk.</Description>
