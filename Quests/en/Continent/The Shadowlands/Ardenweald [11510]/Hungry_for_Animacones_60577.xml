  <Title>Hungry for Animacones</Title>
  <Description>I have to apologize for the state of the Tranquil Pools. Normally, it's quite peaceful here.

The wildseed tenders tell me that the plants you see walking around have eaten all the animacones intended for use in Tirna Vaal.

Could you rip the animacones out of those plants?

We have wildseeds that are in need of that anima.</Description>
