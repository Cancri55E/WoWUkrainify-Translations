  <Description>Oh no, oh no!

My friends, they gave so much. So much of their anima, they lost their forms! We all take a form when we come here, you see. Something that suits us!

But we give our anima, we give! To help the groves. And we give so much... sometimes too much.

I still have some anima. I still have my form! Get me to my friends! We can get THEIR forms back!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Restore soul shapes to Slanknen, Rury, and Awool in the Spirit Glen.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You found them! You found my friends! They have their forms!

Now we have one last thing to do. One last thing!</RewardText>
