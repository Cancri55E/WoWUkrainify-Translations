  <Title>Broken Webs</Title>
  <Description>My husband once served our people as the Speaker of Elune--until he became the Night Warrior. His feelings on the matter are... complicated, to say the least.

Spriggans have been ripping the garden's soulwebs. Would you please help me repair them? I will recount our story as we work.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help repair soul webs.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $n. This task is much easier with help.

&lt;Qadarin sighs.&gt;

I hope you do not think too poorly of Thiernax. His history with the Night Warrior ritual is rife with misplaced guilt and remorse, but I am certain I can get him to see sense and offer his aid.</RewardText>
