  <Title>Silence in the Stalks</Title>
  <Description>Hmm. Well that's not... great. But no cause for alarm, yet!

It has been a long time since our ring withdrew from here, and we probably need to go to its source to get it to return!

Unfortunately, I haven't heard from the Chief Mushroomancer, Cortinarius, since the crisis began.

Please, find him and help us rejoin the rings! Head west of Dreamsong Fenn to the Stalks. You can't miss them... just follow the mushrooms!</Description>
