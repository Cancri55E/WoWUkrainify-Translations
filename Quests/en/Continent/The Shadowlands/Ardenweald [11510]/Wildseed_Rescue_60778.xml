  <Title>Wildseed Rescue</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Featherlight checks his notes.&gt;

Let's see... There was a request for help regarding an imperiled wildseed and... something about an egg? The original note wasn't entirely clear, but the fae who sent it was... Ah! It was Korenth. Again.

Well, I suppose we'll find out what his trouble is soon enough!

I'll fly ahead and look for him. Stick to the path.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Korenth recover the wildseed.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That was fun to watch! You had that bird ready to build a nest and raise hatchlings!

Oh, how I needed that laugh...</RewardText>
