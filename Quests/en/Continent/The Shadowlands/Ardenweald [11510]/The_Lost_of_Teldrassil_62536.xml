  <Title>The Lost of Teldrassil</Title>
  <Description>I learned that Sylvanas burned Teldrassil. I felt my heart break for the night elves.

And that was only the beginning. We know now that the souls lost that day did not go to their intended rest.

But you have the power to begin to correct that, Maw Walker.

If you find yourself in the Maw, look for any of those lost.

Please, bring them home.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel to the Maw and rescue Lost Souls.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you, Maw Walker.

You have brought back a little bit of the light from the darkness.

We will make this right, no matter how long it takes.</RewardText>
