  <Title>The Fourth Wall, er, War</Title>
  <Description>It's time for the next act of your theatrical introduction: the Grand Drama Of Azereth!

Azeroth. Right. All these worlds are hard to tell apart.

Help set the stage, then come back here. You'll need to play a few other characters before you appear as yourself again.

Get a move on! We have a lot to cover!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Set the Stage then help the reenactment of events after the Legion's fall.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I can honestly say I have never seen a performance quite like this.
