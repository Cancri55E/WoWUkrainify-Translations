  <Description>Voras is clearly content to roam the Elder Stand. We will need a way to lure it to us once we are ready to fight.

Did you notice the wildseeds in the clearing where we spotted it? Voras must be feasting on the concentrated anima contained within them.

There should still be some expended wildseeds from before the drought in the Gormhive. Let us create bait too tempting for Voras to ignore.</Description>
