  <Title>A Secret Never Spoken</Title>
  <Description>The first reagent listed in the scroll is a secret never spoken.

Well, that's easy. I know who has tons of secrets! Watcher Vesperbloom, our resident snoop. She keeps the Wild Hunt informed of any nefarious behavior that takes place in the forest.

I know she'd be willing to give us a secret to save Qadarin's soul from dissolving in excruciating pain.

I'll have Thiernax meet you wherever she's hidden them. It'll keep his mind off what's happening to his husband.</Description>
