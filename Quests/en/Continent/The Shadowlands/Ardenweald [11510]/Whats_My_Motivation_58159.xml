  <Title>What's My Motivation?</Title>
  <Description>Now for our finale! A thrilling performance of the most recent trials on Azathoth!

&lt;Featherlight checks his notes.&gt;

Azeroth. Whatever. It features an artificial god, a powerful magic ice princess, an infamous queen, and an eldritch abomination of unspeakable terror! Who doesn't love a good drama with a dash of existential horror?

You're back to playing yourself, so just... do whatever heroes are supposed to do!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Perform the final acts!</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>A fair enough performance! 

I think everyone's more acquainted with your world and the role you've played within it.

Next time, the set design will be a bit more... prepared. But for now...

&lt;Moonberry nods at Ysera.&gt;

I think your friend wishes to have a word. Don't take too long. We still have to hold the final induction ceremony at the Heart of the Forest.</RewardText>
