  <Title>Silk Shortage</Title>
  <Description>We are running short on silk! We use it for so many things, like instruments, weapons, and tools. But our supply has dried up!

We are in desperate need for fresh silk.

Our main hub of silk production is in the Gossamer Cliffs. If you could, seek out Caretaker Lillythistle, and see what the holdup is!</Description>

  <RewardText>Of course silk shipments have stopped!

The entire glade has been attacked by changelings and spriggans! Our poor silkstriders are so stressed out, we can't get any silk from them!

Can you help us?</RewardText>
