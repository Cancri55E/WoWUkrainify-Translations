  <Title>Recovering the Animacones</Title>
  <Description>The grove's droman is wearing one of the masks. I fear he's going to drain all of the anima from the grove's heart!

That anima is meant for the forest's other groves. If we lose it... then Heartwood Grove would have been lost for nothing...

We'll carve a path to the Shrouded Mire to find the droman before it's too late.

Many of these masked fae have stolen Heartwood Grove's animacones. We must recover them along the way. 

In this drought, every bit of anima is precious.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover $1oa animacones from the Possessed.</LogDescription>
