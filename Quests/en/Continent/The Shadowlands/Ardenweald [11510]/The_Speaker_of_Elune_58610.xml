  <Title>The Speaker of Elune</Title>
  <Description>Fortune smiles upon us, $n. We have found a soul in Ardenweald who was once a Night Warrior in life, as Tyrande is now. 

His name is Thiernax. I am told he assists in tending to the spirits resting in the Garden of Night.

Seek him out and petition him for aid. I pray he will have wisdom to share.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Thiernax near the Queen's Garden.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak with Qadarin in the Garden of Night.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>&lt;Qadarin watches Thiernax race off. He sighs before turning to you.&gt;

My apologies. Thiernax may have seemed curt, but there is a reason for his reluctance to speak of the Night Warrior.

If you have a moment to help me out in the garden, I can elaborate. Then I will see what can be done to convince Thiernax to help your mother.</RewardText>
