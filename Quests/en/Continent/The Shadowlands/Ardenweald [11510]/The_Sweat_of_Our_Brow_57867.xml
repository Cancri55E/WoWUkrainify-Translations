  <Title>The Sweat of Our Brow</Title>
  <Description>Ah, an outsider! You are perfect for this task.

The spriggans are known for their mischief. They have been cursing our tools and supplies and trapping unsuspecting workers!

Like our curses, they must obey the rules. You'll need shimmerdust for baskets, thread made of gossamer for harps, and minty fresh breath for the soulwebs. How odd.

Good luck and let the Lady of the Falls know when you're done. She'll be delighted to hear it!</Description>
