  <Description>They're draining us of our anima! Some of the weaker souls... They are close to danger. They need anima or they will lose cohesion and drift. Such a thing is dangerous, especially now with how imbalanced things are in Ardenweald.

I can spare some of my own energy, but I will not have enough for everyone.

Choose, champion. Who will be saved today?</Description>
