  <Title>Monster Hunting</Title>
  <Description>Make ready, $c. We hunt a worldeater.

They are the largest of devourers, massive beings who can drain anima from an entire region within a matter of moments. 

With Ardenweald suffering from the drought, a worldeater's presence could prove disastrous.

Still, we must not rush into battle without first understanding our prey. Tread the Elder Stand with me. Even creatures such as these leave spoor.

Knowing our quarry will be what allows us to slay it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search for clues and tracks to learn more about the worldeater.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This problem just got a lot larger. We need a new plan.</RewardText>
