  <Title>Tough as Silk</Title>
  <Description>We are the heart of silk production in Ardenweald, but we can't do our work! 

Our grove has been completely taken over by spriggans and these strange shapeshifting... things.

The silkstriders who spin the silk are very delicate creatures. They need peace and calm, and a little music to keep them happy! But with all these monsters all over the place, they're super stressed out.

Please, can you get in there and eliminate these hooligans, and see if you can help get us up and running again?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay attackers, save caretakers, and hatch silkstrider larvae in the Gossamer Cliffs.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you! We are so grateful for your help with slaying those cretins, and rescuing our people.</RewardText>
