  <Title>A Token of Lost Love</Title>
  <Description>My sister, Alexstrasza, lost her prime consort, Korialstrasz, towards the end of our war with Deathwing.

She has loved many in her long life, but none as deeply as he. I know in my heart she loves him still.

Find Alexstrasza in the Vermillion Redoubt and ask for a token of her lost love. It will surely prove a powerful reagent for the counter-curse.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Alexstrasza at the Vermillion Redoubt in Twilight Highlands.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Ysera at the Heart of the Forest in Ardenweald.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>This figurine... I have not seen it since...

I gave this to her when we first became Aspects. Our duties would draw us apart for the first time in our lives. To know that she has kept it all this time...

&lt;Ysera wipes her eyes.&gt;

We will put it to good use.</RewardText>
