  <Title>A Naughty Story</Title>
  <Description>&lt;You have held this book for less than five minutes and it has already escaped once, bitten you twice and somehow managed to steal some gold.

This is not what you were expecting from a "Naughty Story" but then again, maybe you should have.

You bind the book closed so it will hopefully cause a minimum of mischief. Time to bring it to Archivist Dreyden.&gt;</Description>

  <RewardText>You found one of my books!

Oh. That one.

&lt;Dreyden sighs.&gt;

I suppose I will take it back. Thanks, I guess.</RewardText>
