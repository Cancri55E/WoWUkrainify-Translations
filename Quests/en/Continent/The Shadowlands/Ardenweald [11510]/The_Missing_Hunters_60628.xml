  <Title>The Missing Hunters</Title>
  <Description>Strange creatures have been seen lurking just outside the grove. Terrible, ugly things.

Whatever they might be, they are not native to Ardenweald. 

It does not matter how they breached our borders, though. Every one of them must be eliminated.

I sent my best huntsmen and huntresses to slay them, but not one has returned. See if you can determine what has delayed them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Jynkla, Serinkai, Rondar, and Ara'lon.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Only Ara'lon and Lumera survived? The rest have fallen?

&lt;Korayn trembles with unbridled fury.&gt; 

I will see to it that their bodies are retrieved. And this cannot go unpunished. We will avenge them all!</RewardText>
