  <Title>Infusing the Wildseed</Title>
  <Description>Dreamweaver tells me of a ritual to quell the wildseed's nightmares... but it will require anima.

A soul named Proglo lives beneath this tree, gathering anima for the grove's caretakers to use.

His mortal life came to a violent end, and his soul has been skittish ever since. He will not respond well to your current form.

I will grant you the ability to assume the soulshape of a fox. Approach Proglo in your new form to gain his trust and ask for his anima.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Soulshape to collect anima from Proglo, then infuse the wildseed with the collected anima.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak with Ara'lon within Hibernal Hollow.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>It's going to be difficult, but I know of a place where there may be enough anima to help this wildseed.</RewardText>
