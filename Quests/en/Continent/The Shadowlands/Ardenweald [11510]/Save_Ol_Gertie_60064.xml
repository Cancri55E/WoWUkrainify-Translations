  <Title>Save Ol' Gertie</Title>
  <Description>We have to find Ol' Gertie! She is the broodmother of the silkstriders, and is our most reliable producer. We cannot lose her.

But I cannot get to her and see if she is all right. She is usually at the top of the cliffs, at the highest point. Can you get up there, and make sure that she is safe?

If she is not... then may justice fall swift and hard on the perpetrator.</Description>
