  <Title>Big Problem, Little Vorkai</Title>
  <Description>Ara'lon's report matches what I have seen. Too many enemies, and too few of the Wild Hunt to dispose of them on our own.

Fortunately, I feel strongly inclined to take matters into my own hands. And avenge my fallen hunters. 

Let us depart. We will show those monsters the fury of nature.</Description>

If we don't, then soon it could spread all across Ardenweald.</RewardText>
