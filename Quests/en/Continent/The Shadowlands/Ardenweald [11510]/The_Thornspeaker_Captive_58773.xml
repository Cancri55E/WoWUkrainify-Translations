  <Title>The Thornspeaker Captive</Title>
  <Description>Good to know the old bear hasn't forgotten me.

Unfortunately, neither have the Drust. I was enjoying a peaceful afterlife before they showed up.

Do not bother trying to force open this cage. You can only unlock it with three separate keys, and each one is held by a different Drust commander.

They should be somewhere nearby. Find them.</Description>
