  <Description>Things are chaotic here in the Tranquil Pools. I'd be devastated if the Winter Queen saw this.

This is meant to be a peaceful place where we give anima to wildseeds.

But with the current drought, starving beasts have encroached on the pools and are trying to feed on the anima themselves.

Sadly, we need to put them down... or else they may endanger the spirits within the wildseeds.</Description>

  <RewardText>Normally, I wouldn't require help from whatever race you are.

Ah... my apologies. That was rude.

Please understand that Ardenweald is home to souls from across all of the mortal realm. It's hard for me to keep track of every race that arrives here.</RewardText>
