  <Title>Preparing for the Winter Queen</Title>
  <Description>Tirna Vaal is ready for the Winter Queen's arrival! And it's all thanks to you.

You have more than upheld your end of our bargain... and yet I was not able to do the same.

That is absolutely unacceptable for a faerie like me! What would the others think if they knew I had failed to honor our agreement?

Please, allow me to make it up to you. I may not have been able to deliver your message to the Queen, but I have a special surprise that I hope you'll accept instead!</Description>
