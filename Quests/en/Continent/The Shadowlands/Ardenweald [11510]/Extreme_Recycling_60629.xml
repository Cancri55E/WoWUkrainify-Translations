  <Description>The Wild Hunt serves the Winter Queen under the leadership of Lord Herne. We are elite fighters, hunters, and trackers.

But we cannot fight without weapons and supplies. The droman here informs me that there are severe obstacles to their delivery.

I do not have time to wait. We need equipment, and we need it now.

See what you can scavenge from the field. A broken weapon can always be mended and put to use again.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay the Blighted and take their weapons.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You found far more weapons than I expected.

Very strange. How could they acquire so many of OUR blades?

&lt;Korayn appears troubled.&gt;

They will be used against our enemies again, I swear it.</RewardText>
