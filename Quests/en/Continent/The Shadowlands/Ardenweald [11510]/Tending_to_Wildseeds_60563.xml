  <Title>Tending to Wildseeds</Title>
  <Description>We infuse wildseeds with anima from the animacones we collect in the surrounding area.

But the caretakers are missing, and we have wildseeds in need of an anima infusion.

This is an absolute mess that must be corrected before the Winter Queen arrives!

I've already gathered a basket of animacones. Can you use them to infuse a few of the wildseeds?

I'll show you how it's done, but then I have to look for the missing caretakers.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect basket of animacones, then use them on $2oa wildseeds.</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>Fine work. We mustn't stop tending to the wildseeds that the Winter Queen has chosen to be saved.

Now, perhaps you can lend me a hand with another matter.</RewardText>
