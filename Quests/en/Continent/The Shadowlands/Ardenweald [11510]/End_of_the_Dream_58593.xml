  <Title>End of the Dream</Title>
  <Description>The time has come. The ritual will be complete when you have fully entered into the spirit's dreams.

It will be as if you are her, in every aspect.

She relives the moment of her death over and over again. It torments her. Something about how she ended... she had no control over her actions. She hurt the ones she loved.

Speak to me when you are ready to immerse yourself in her nightmare of the end.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Witness the end of the spirit's life.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>What a terrible end for such a majestic spirit... 

But that was why she connected with you! Because you are of the same world! Azeroth!

Now, I can finally feel her nightmares wane. At last, she knows some peace.

Thank you, my friend.</RewardText>
