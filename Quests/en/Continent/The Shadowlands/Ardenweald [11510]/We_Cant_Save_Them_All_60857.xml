  <Title>We Can't Save Them All</Title>
  <Description>I am surprised--but pleased--that you weren't torn to pieces! Well done.

But now... I fear we have a far more serious task to complete.

The Winter Queen has decreed that Heartwood Grove's anima is to be reclaimed, and its denizens must leave it to wither. Not all of their wildseeds will go with them. In fact, only a few have been chosen to be saved.

We are to bring the final list to Droman Krelnor.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the list of saved wildseeds to Droman Krelnor at the Heartwood Grove.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Droman Krelnor sighs wearily as he reads the short list of wildseeds.&gt;

At least a few will be relocated to Tirna Vaal.</RewardText>
