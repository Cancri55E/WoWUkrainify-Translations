  <Title>Remnants of the Wild Hunt</Title>
  <Description>The Wild Hunt is holding the line against these monsters, lest they overrun the road to Hibernal Hollow.

Too many of my fellow hunters have been possessed by the dark magic of those twisted masks.

But with you here, we might be able to turn the tide. 

Aid any hunters you can find before our foes turn them against us.

I will meet you farther within the meadow. If we rally our numbers, we can bring an end to this battle.</Description>
