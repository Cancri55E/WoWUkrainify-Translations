  <Description>When my grove withered, I answered the Queen's call and joined the Wild Hunt.

Nothing can be done for Tirna Noch. But it wounds me to see it crawling with foes of the forest.

We need a great deal of anima. The masked fae must be keeping a stockpile somewhere within the grove--we just need to find it.

They likely used soulwebs to collect and move the anima. If I examine them, I should be able to pick up the trail.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Investigate the Depleted Soulwebs in Tirna Noch, to find the greatest concentration of anima in the grove.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The Drust have stolen more anima than I expected. To think that they have deprived us of this much in the midst of a drought...

We must take back whatever we can. Not only for the sake of the wildseed, but to also thwart whatever the Drust intend to do.</RewardText>
