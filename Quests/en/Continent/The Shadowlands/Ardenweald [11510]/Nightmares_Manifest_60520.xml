  <Title>Nightmares Manifest</Title>
  <Description>Oh, this isn't good. As soon as you left, the spirit's nightmares spilled out all over Tirna Vaal. 

I've done everything to try to soothe her. I've tried singing to her, I've tried telling her stories, but nothing I do seems to calm her.

Please, would you confront and dispel her nightmares? That might be the only thing that will work.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Confront the wildseed's nightmares in Tirna Vaal.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>There, that seems to have calmed her. I can feel her dreams begin to ease.

You really do have a knack for this!

But I'm worried that we're only buying time, and we need to do something more drastic.</RewardText>
