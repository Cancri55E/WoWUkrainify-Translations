  <Description>Behold, Marasmius!

This is his home, his heart. Every mushroom in Ardenweald, maybe even all of the Shadowlands, stems from here. And the masked fae want to take him for their own purposes. As chief mushroomancer, I cannot abide this.

Our foes may look mindless, but they are clever. They will have tracked my position by now.

I shall make my final stand here, and hope that Marasmius is strong enough to lend his aid.

Will you stand with me, $c?</Description>
