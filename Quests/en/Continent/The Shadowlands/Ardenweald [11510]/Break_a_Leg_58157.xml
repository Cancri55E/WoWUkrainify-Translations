  <Description>The show is about to begin! You... that's what you're going to wear? Well, I suppose it works.

For your grand introduction, we will re-enact recent victories and events that took place on Azzinoth. Er, Azeroth. That's where you're from, right?

The Starlight Company has graciously volunteered to assist us in this production. We've recruited some special guests as well! 

Don't worry about the script. This is your story, after all!

Just try not to get too much blood on stage. It's hard to clean.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Reenact the Third Invasion of the Legion on Azeroth.</LogDescription>
