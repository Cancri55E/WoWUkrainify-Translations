  <Title>The Sea of Souls</Title>
  <Description>Some force here seeks to keep us from finding Tyrande.

The trail of bodies seems to go into this... stream of souls. 

I suggest we split up. I will follow along the bank of the river. You enter its current and follow the trail.

Should you need me, I will be close at hand.

We will find Tyrande, no matter where this course leads.</Description>
