  <Description>You! You there!

I, Clarion Song, need your assistance. Yes, yes, give yourself a moment to bask in my glory.

&lt;Clarion Song gives you a moment.&gt;

Done? Good. I need you to catch a troublesome vulpin kit. He is positively barbaric! Running amok, causing havoc, ruining my beauty rest! He's using a concealing charm to make himself invisible, but I know it's him!

Make yourself useful and catch that kit!</Description>
