  <Title>Finish What He Started</Title>
  <Description>Finding Sha'lor is our main priority. But there is another opportunity.

Take the Gormherd Branch that he dropped. I know he was tinkering with it so that it would work on wild gorm.

Use it on the gorm in the burrows, and see if you can collect any of their gorm gris.

Don't bother with the little ones; get the really potent stuff from the bigger gorm.

Perhaps if we can collect enough, and find that silly sylvar, he will not rush horns-first into the burrows again.</Description>
