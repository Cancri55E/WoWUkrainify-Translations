  <Title>Call of the Hunt</Title>
  <Description>You've done so much, but the Queen's focus is still divided across the forest.

If you want to deliver your message, then we need to help lessen her burden.

Let's start with the Wild Hunt. They are the protectors of Ardenweald, and dealing with the threat of the masked fae has stretched them thin.

Seek out Hunt-Captain Korayn at Glitterfall Basin. Last I heard, her hunting party could use reinforcements.

And don't let her ferocity put you off. She's quite nice as long as you're not her prey!</Description>
