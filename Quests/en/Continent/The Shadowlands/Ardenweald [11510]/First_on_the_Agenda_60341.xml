  <Title>First on the Agenda</Title>
  <Description>Let's make a deal, $n. I'll seek out the Winter Queen on your behalf if you complete a few of my duties in my stead. The Queen isn't the only one who's been kept busy by the drought!

First, you're going to help my fellow fae here with their spriggan problem. Boot their leader off that poor moth! Featherlight will tell you where to go after that. 

We'll reunite in Tirna Vaal if you survive.

Oh, and I would stay on the path if I were you. Ardenweald can be dangerous for the unwary!</Description>
