  <Title>Belly Full of Fae</Title>
  <Description>The local flora have gone somewhat wild during this anima drought.

It seems they swallowed most of the young fae who were tending to the wildseeds here.

At least now we know where they've been.

Oh, don't worry. This isn't the first time this has happened. We can last quite a while inside those plants.

Take my dagger. Use it to cut through the shrubbery and free the other wildseed tenders.</Description>

  <RewardText>Great work. This should help get the Tranquil Pools back to normal.

I admit, I had thought the worst when I couldn't find any of the tenders. I'm glad they were only eaten by the local vegetation.</RewardText>
