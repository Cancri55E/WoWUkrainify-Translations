  <Title>An Escapist Novel</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Action, adventure, thrills, chills... This book has it all! Penned by a mortal soul who led an amazing life, this book is a page-turner. 

But is it true? Could one person fight conspiracies, ancient evils, vast enemy armies, demons and even gods in a single lifetime?

On further reflection, it could be true, but what is a "duck" this book speaks of? That part sounds fake.

Still... it was a good story. Archivist Dreyden would probably be pleased to have his book back.&gt;</Description>
