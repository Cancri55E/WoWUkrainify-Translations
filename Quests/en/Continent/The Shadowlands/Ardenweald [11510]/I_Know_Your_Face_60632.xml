  <Title>I Know Your Face</Title>
  <Description>This voice... I have heard it before. Though it is distorted and vengeful now.

He hunts us.

But I am not prey. And I will not let him gloat over his slain quarry. That is not the way of the Wild Hunt.

Though he may draw us to ground of his choosing, we will fight him.

And we will win. Are you with me?</Description>

  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Ara'lon at Glitterfall Basin.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>It cannot be easy for Korayn to hunt one of our own... but she is right. The forest is not safe so long as Lorkron lurks within it.

What a terrible fate... both for those who become possessed, and those who must hunt them down.</RewardText>
