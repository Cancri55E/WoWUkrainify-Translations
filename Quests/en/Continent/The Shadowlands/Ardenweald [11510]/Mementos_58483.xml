  <Title>Mementos</Title>
  <Description>At Heartwood Grove, I heard tales about the fall of Tirna Noch. I never thought that I would see it with my own eyes.

It brings me great sadness. And I wonder... if this is the fate that awaits my old grove as well.

I can't believe that everything that was once here is truly gone. 

Perhaps there are still some mementos that can be recovered. Something to remember the fallen.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect Stolen Mementos from slain enemies in Tirna Noch.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you.

I know these are just objects, but they mean so much. Sometimes just holding a piece of one's past can be a comfort.

It means not everything is lost.</RewardText>
