  <Title>One Big Problem</Title>
  <Description>We must go after Master Sha'lor. Tirna Vaal needs him! And I... I...

I will report to the droman. They must know that Sha'lor is in danger. Then, I will enter the burrows myself from the south and help you defeat it.

For now, see what you can find. I refuse to believe that he is gone.

That monster will know the fury of a vorkai.</Description>
