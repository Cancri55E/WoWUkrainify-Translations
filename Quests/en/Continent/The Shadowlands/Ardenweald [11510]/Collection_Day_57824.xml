  <Title>Collection Day</Title>
  <Description>Now, we can collect the gorm gris for Guardian Kota!

Once the gormlings have eaten something, we can 'encourage' them to give it back up. What they produce, we call gorm gris!

My Gormherd Branch should encourage them to do this safely. 

Go on, give it a try on good ol' Gloober first.

What has me worried is how the other gormlings might behave. They have been acting so strangely lately!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Gormherd Branch on Gloober, then collect gorm gris from the Gorged Gormlings.</LogDescription>
