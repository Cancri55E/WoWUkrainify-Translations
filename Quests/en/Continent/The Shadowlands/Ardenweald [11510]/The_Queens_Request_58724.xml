  <Title>The Queen's Request</Title>
  <Description>Dire portents indeed. 

I have used what little anima we possess to save our groves and the spirits they nurture. So many were lost... all as the Heart of the Forest grew ever weaker.

Keeping the Banished One bound within the Maw will require more anima than Ardenweald can spare.

&lt;The Queen considers for a moment.&gt;

Sire Denathrius is a master of anima extraction. Journey to Revendreth and inform him of our plight. I know he will lend us his aid.

Your allies in Oribos can open the way.</Description>
