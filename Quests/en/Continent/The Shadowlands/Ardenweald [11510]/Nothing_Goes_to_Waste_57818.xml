  <Title>Nothing Goes to Waste</Title>
  <Description>The gormlings are industrious creatures. Naturally, they are our source of gorm gris.

Gormlings are cute, small, and hungry, like Gloober here! Except he is not hungry right now, because I just fed him. Look at that little belly...

&lt;Ahem&gt;. I digress.

Gormlings will be drawn to consume anything that is not brimming with anima. They find it simply delicious. 

Take that wildseed there, and bring it into their pen. Then, see if you can get the gormlings to feast upon it!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect the Depleted Wildseed, place it in the gormling pen, and coax gormlings to eat it.</LogDescription>
