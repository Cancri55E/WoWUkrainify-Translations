  <Description>In order to perform the ritual, I will need some nox root from Darkreach.

It is a unique plant that only grows within soil that has been corrupted by Drust magic.

Darkreach lies to the west, not far from my den. What was once a peaceful, verdant grove is now filled with blight and ruin.

I will travel to the Heart of the Forest to prepare the ritual. Meet me there when you have gathered the nox root.</Description>
