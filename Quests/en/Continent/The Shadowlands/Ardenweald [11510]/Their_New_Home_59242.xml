  <Title>Their New Home</Title>
  <Description>It pains me to leave my mother behind... but the souls of my people must be brought to safety.

I heard the attendants in Oribos speaking of a place called Ardenweald. A realm of ancient forests where the spirits of nature slumber.

This is a land you know well, is it not? I would see its wonders with my own eyes.

Perhaps the spirits there will know how to save my minn'do from the Night Warrior's power.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take Shandris Feathermoon and the rescued night elf souls to Ysera at the Heart of the Forest in Ardenweald.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Ysera in the Heart of the Forest.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>My heart aches for Tyrande. The might of the Night Warrior is empowering her to battle these monsters... but it will consume her if we do nothing.

Shandris and I will investigate a... promising whisper that I have heard. I shall call upon you when I know more.</RewardText>
