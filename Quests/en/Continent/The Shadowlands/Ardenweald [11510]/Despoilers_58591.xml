  <Title>Despoilers</Title>
  <Description>Your efforts at Tirna Noch have enraged the Drust. 

Those creatures of decay and destruction swell at our borders, and already they pierce our defenses.

Now we see their real faces, and know the true nature of our foe.

Strike at them. It will buy us time for you to conduct Dreamweaver's ritual.</Description>
