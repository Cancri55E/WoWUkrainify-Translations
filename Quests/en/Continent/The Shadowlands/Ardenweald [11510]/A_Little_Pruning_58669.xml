  <Title>A Little Pruning</Title>
  <Description>Spriggans sometimes invade the garden to spread mischief and mayhem. There is no end to the trouble they bring with them.

Usually, the Wild Hunt keeps them in check... but their huntsmen and huntresses have had far more pressing concerns as of late. Thiernax and I have been helping to keep the garden clear, but he's run off somewhere to brood.

&lt;Qadarin shakes his head.&gt;

You would be doing me a favor if you helped me clear the Queen's garden of these vermin.</Description>
