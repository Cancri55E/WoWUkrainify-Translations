  <Description>As you can see, we have a gorm problem.$b$bI'm not sure what has them so riled up. They've been getting bigger, more hostile. It must be due to the anima drought. If nothing stops them, they'll eat everything!$b$bTheir egg production is out of control. We can't let their population grow any larger. Please, go in to their nests and destroy as many of their eggs as you can find.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy $1oa Gorm Eggs in the Banks of Life.</LogDescription>
