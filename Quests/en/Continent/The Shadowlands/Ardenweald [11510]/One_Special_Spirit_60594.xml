  <Title>One Special Spirit</Title>
  <Description>You've been a huge help to Tirna Vaal. I need to bring this anima to one of our newest wildseeds.

I'd love for you to come with me. It's only fair, since you're the one who recovered the animacones.

I'm quite excited for you! Let's go.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Go with Dreamweaver to feed anima to the wildseed in Tirna Vaal.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Droman Tashmur.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Starlight shines within Dreamweaver, radiant and serene.

And... two rivers meet in a lush delta. A wildseed and a mortal, both new to the forest. Bonded by spirit and by fate.

Long has it been since the boughs beheld such an event. The weald will be watching.</RewardText>
