  <Title>From a Dark Place</Title>
  <Description>You rescued some of the night elves from the Maw before. While the danger is still great, I must ask you to do it again.

I have to believe that we can save them. As many of them as possible.

Please, go and see if you can recover any more lost souls.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel to the Maw and rescue Lost Souls.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I thank you once again, Maw Walker.

These souls are finally free of the torment and pain.

There are still so many more, but I am optimistic that we may yet save them.</RewardText>
