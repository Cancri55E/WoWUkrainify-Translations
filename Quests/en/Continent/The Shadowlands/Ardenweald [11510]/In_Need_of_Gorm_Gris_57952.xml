  <Title>In Need of Gorm Gris</Title>
  <Description>Our neighboring grove at Glitterfall Basin has sent out a desperate plea for gorm gris.

It may have humble origins, but it is an important ingredient for our artisans and crafters. As this drought goes on, it has become increasingly difficult to collect.

I would like to help them out, with the resources that we are able to spare.

Please, find Master Sha'lor out by the Tranquil Pools, where he keeps our little gormling population.

Ask him for more gorm gris.</Description>
