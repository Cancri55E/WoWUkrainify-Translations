  <Title>The Way to Hibernal Hollow</Title>
  <Description>I've never seen a wildseed quite like this one. Even the ones that bonded with their caretakers in the past never manifested nightmares like this.

Then again, we've also never had a living mortal in our midst.

We need to bring this wildseed to Hibernal Hollow. There it can receive the care and attention it needs.

I'll place it into the spirit cradle. Can you ask Niya if she would accompany you?

The poor sylvar has been directionless since the fall of her grove. This would be good for her.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recruit Niya to help you bring the wildseed to Hibernal Hollow.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak with Niya next to the wildseed's cradle in the Tranquil Pools.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>I'm surprised that any wildseed could spawn such nightmares.</RewardText>
