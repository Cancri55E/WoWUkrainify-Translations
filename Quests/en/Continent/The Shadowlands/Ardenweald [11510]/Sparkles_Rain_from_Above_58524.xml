  <Title>Sparkles Rain from Above</Title>
  <Description>You found the heart of the grove! And it's full of anima!

The Drust don't seem to like the idea of you taking it from them. They're massing in great numbers all over the forest!

We need to get you and the others out of here safely.

I can help. How do you feel about dishing out a little sparkly mayhem?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Lady Moonberry and escape Tirna Noch.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You found and took their anima right from the heart of the grove? Impressive.

Dreamweaver will be most pleased. But I expect that we will soon encounter some unhappy visitors.

We must move quickly to aid the spirit in this wildseed... before we are overrun.</RewardText>
