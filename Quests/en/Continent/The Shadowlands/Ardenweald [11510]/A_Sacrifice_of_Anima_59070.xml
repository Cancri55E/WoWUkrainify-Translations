  <Title>A Sacrifice of Anima</Title>
  <Description>The last thing we need for this counter-curse is some attuned anima.

Of course, we don't have much to spare. That means this is more of a sacrifice than it normally would be.

But you know what? The spriggans made this mess, so they should help clean it up. Some really nasty ones have been causing mischief in Tirna Scithe. They should have the anima we need.

Thiernax looks like he could use some nice, vengeful, therapeutic spriggan stomping. I'll have him meet you there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Spriggans in Tirna Scithe to collect Mischief-touched Anima.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>HA! That will teach those spriggans! You mess with the mistrunner, you get the magical horn!

Now we have the anima we need! And, conveniently, it's already attuned to the bad attitude of the one who cast the curse.</RewardText>
