  <Title>Bring More Friends!</Title>
  <Description>This is only the beginning, friend.$b$bI must thank you again for rescuing me. Now that we have found a safe route, I am but the first of many. Druids from all around Ardenweald have heard of the safety of this glade, and I wish to bring them all here.$b$bI have known Roriel for most of my time in this place. She is a capable healer, despite her appearance. She would be a fine addition to this place.$b$bShe was last seen near Tirna Fein to the west. Please let her know the way is clear.</Description>
