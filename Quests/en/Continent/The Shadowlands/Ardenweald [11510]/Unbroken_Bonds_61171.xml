  <Title>Unbroken Bonds</Title>
  <Description>The Drust will pay for this foul curse that they've unleashed upon us.

We have lost too many allies... too many friends to give up now. Even though we cannot save those who have fallen into possession, we can end their torment. I will instruct the hunt to put down all possessed they encounter.

Please deliver this report to the Winter Queen. She must be told what we have learned.

Thank you for your service, $n. You are a true friend and guardian of Ardenweald.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver Lord Herne's report to the Winter Queen.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>If the Thornspeakers have no way to break the curse, then perhaps there truly is no hope for the possessed. These are tidings most dire.</RewardText>
