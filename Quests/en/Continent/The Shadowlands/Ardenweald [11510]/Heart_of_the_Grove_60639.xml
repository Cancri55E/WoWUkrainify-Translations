  <Title>Heart of the Grove</Title>
  <Description>We were supposed to take the heart of the grove to Tirna Vaal when we left this place to wither.

The masked fae struck before that could happen. They must be after the heart of the grove!

The heart contains all of the anima that was meant to save the other groves. We can't afford to lose it.

Can you secure it? I need to find Korenth, one of our healers. His skills will help any survivors we find.</Description>
