  <Title>Into the Maw</Title>
  <Description>I have not seen Tyrande since she departed for Icecrown... but I see her in my dreams. She stalks a nightmarish landscape, brimming with the might of the Night Warrior.

Such power is too much for any mortal to bear for long. I shudder to think of the toll it has taken on my minn'do.

Highlord Fordragon has told me of the Maw. If you truly have braved its horrors before, then I ask that you guide me through them as well.

We must find Tyrande and convince her to let go of the Night Warrior's rage.</Description>
