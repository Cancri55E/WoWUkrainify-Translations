  <Title>Archivist on the Edge</Title>
  <Description>If the curse isn't removed, Qadarin will waste away until nothing is left! 

We used to bind and seal curses just like this all the time, but we haven't had to deal with one in ages. 

Go to Archivist Dreyden at the Grove of Memory. He will know which curse this is and can give you its scroll. 

Bring it back so we can figure out what we need in order to cast a counter-curse.

Hurry, $n!</Description>
