  <Description>The Horned Hunter is no longer here. But I do know where he went.

He tracked his prey to the west of here, in the Elder Stand. These woods in particular have grown dangerous as of late, and we are currently beset by invading devourers.

They have overrun the roads between here and the Stand. I shall accompany you across the bridge, and see that you are delivered to the Horned Hunter.</Description>
