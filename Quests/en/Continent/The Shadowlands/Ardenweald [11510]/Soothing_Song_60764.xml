  <Title>Soothing Song</Title>
  <Description>I will fly ahead to Hibernal Hollow and convince the Droman Aliothe to help us. Hopefully she will have agreed by the time you and Niya arrive.

This wildseed seems to take comfort in your presence, so you'll need to stick close to it.

Niya will also need to sing to the wildseed to keep it calm... or else the nightmares may return.

Spriggans love to interrupt our songs, so be on the lookout for them.

Let me know when you're ready to head off.</Description>
