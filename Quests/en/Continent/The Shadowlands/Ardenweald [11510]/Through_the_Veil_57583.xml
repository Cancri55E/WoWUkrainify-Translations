  <Title>Through the Veil</Title>
  <Description>I like you, youngling. You put in the work while the others sit in their fancy court, leaving old Marasmius to keep the fae rings thriving.

Here, take one of my spores back with you to the Heart of the Forest. Find somewhere nice and cozy for me to rest, will you?

Come back and visit me whenever you like. Cort and I can keep an eye on things for now, but there will always be plenty for you to do here. Might even be something special in it for you.</Description>

  <RewardText>Ahh, it's nice to stretch out again. I've missed this place, you know.

&lt;Marasmius pauses for a moment.&gt;

Don't tell anyone here I said that, all right?</RewardText>
