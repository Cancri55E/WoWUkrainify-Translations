  <Title>Bound With Shade</Title>
  <Description>About that scroll you found...$b$bI keep looking at that line in the second stanza - "bound with wood and shade". The "shade", in particular, intrigues me.$b$bI must admit, I've often considered taking some of the area's residual sha essence and incorporating it into a brew. I suspect that this is the shade which our recipe calls for.$b$bYou will find large amalgamations of sha to the southeast of our tree... though you may also be able to harvest some from the local wildlife.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Harvest 100 drops of Shade by slaying sha creatures and wildlife near The Sunset Brewgarden.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You needn't look far to find shade around here, friend.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Beautiful. This will make a fine addition to our brew.$b$bThe most dangerous ingredients are quite often the most delicious.</RewardText>
