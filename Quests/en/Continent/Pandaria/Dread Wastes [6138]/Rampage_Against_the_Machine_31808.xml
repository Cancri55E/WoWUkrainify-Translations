  <Description>Kovok has progressed at an astonishing rate. Perhaps the years in hibernation effected his growth process...$b$bWhatever the reason, this could not have come at a better time. I believe it is time to test his abilities.$b$bYou have done so much to aid in his training. It is only fitting that you assist him in his first battle.$b$bI've already guided him to the edge of the scar. Find him and destroy Shek'zeer's army!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 200 Mantid while controlling Kovok in the Scar.
