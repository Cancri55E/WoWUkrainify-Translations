I know that they maintain shrines within their settlement, Kor'vess.$b$bOne is a heartroot of the very tree that they inhabit. The other is a dark pillar, connecting them with their queen.$b$bThese shrines are the wood and shade. If my predictions are right... the daggers should react in their presence.</Description>
