  <Title>Old Age and Treachery</Title>
  <Description>Look, I ain't got reason to trust you, but there's a task I can't give to my crew.$B$BI need you to search the wreck of our old ship, the Mist-Hopper, and bring back the charter. It'd be sealed up in a silver tube, in a footlocker.$B$BIt's sort of, uh... incriminating. I can't risk any of the crew finding it if they decide to visit the ol' girl. She's resting on the Shelf of Mazu, to the west.$B$BI'd suggest riding a rip current out there, if you got the stomach. They're all over the shelf.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover the charter from the Wreck of the Mist-Hopper.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>To be honest, I hope a grouper ate the old charter.$B$BWait, then it might end up here anyway. Dang it!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That's the charter tube, alright. I guess you'd like to know what all the fuss is about, eh?$B$B&lt;Soggy lets out a long sigh as he un-caps the tube.&gt;$B$BMight as well get it over with.</RewardText>
