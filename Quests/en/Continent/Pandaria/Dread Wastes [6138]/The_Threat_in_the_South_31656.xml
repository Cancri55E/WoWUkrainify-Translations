  <Title>The Threat in the South</Title>
  <Description>With the Sha of Hatred dead, the greatest threat to this land is vanquished, but our travels along the southern border have made it exceedingly clear that the mantid forces in the Dread Wastes are on the move, and likely won't be held back for long.$B$BIf you wish to continue to aid the Shado-Pan, I would recommend reporting in to Bowmistress Li on the Serpent's Spine. She oversees the great wall that separates the terrors in the Dread Wastes from our bountiful lands to the east.</Description>
