  <Description>We've found the blades, bound them together with wood and shade, and blessed them with an ancient incantation. If I'm not mistaken, it's time to use this thing.$b$bThe sprites spoke of an ancient piece of sap within the Amber Hibernal, a mantid cave near their empress' palace. That must be the "Blood of Ancients" that the prophecy spoke of.$b$bWhatever's inside that sap must be important. Good luck, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Ruining Fork on Iyyokuk the Lucid, then protect him until he is able to escape.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Make sure to bring that forked blade with you.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There was a... a mantid inside that amber? I never would have thought that the solution to our war on the mantid would be... another mantid.$b$bThere are still many things that I have left to learn, but I do know this: that CERTAINLY wasn't a beer recipe.</RewardText>
