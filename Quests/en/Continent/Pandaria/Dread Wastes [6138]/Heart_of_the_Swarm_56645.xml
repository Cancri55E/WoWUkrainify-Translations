  <Title>Heart of the Swarm</Title>
  <Description>We need to know what we're up against. Before we return to the Serpent's Spine, we should take the opportunity to scout the swarm.

I will fly us over the Heart of Fear. We should be able to survey Empress Shek'zara's forces from above. Then we can determine the extent to which N'Zoth has bolstered their ranks with his own.</Description>
