  <Title>Better Dead than Dread</Title>
  <Description>I am sure many of our associates will be requesting your services after your victory here. But I have received a request for aid from our defenders at the wall along the Dread Wastes.

If you would assist them, then take a kite and check in with Bowmistress Li.
