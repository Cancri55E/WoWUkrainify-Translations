  <Title>Falling Down</Title>
  <Description>It's bad enough trying to hold off the mantid, but now we've got spiders swarming up from the ruins below.$B$BOne of my best marksmen caught a blast of webbing around his leg and got pulled straight down!$B$BWe think he's alive, but I don't have the manpower to send anyone in after him. We're stretched thin up here, $c.$B$BIf you want to help, use the rope behind me to drop down into the ruins. You're not afraid of heights are you?$B$BHow about spiders?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Shado-Pan Rope to descend into the Terrace of Gurthan and search for the fallen Shado-Pan marksman.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The fall wasn't that bad, actually. I've always had a knack for soft landings.$B$BThat I landed on a pile of spider corpses probably helped, too.</RewardText>
