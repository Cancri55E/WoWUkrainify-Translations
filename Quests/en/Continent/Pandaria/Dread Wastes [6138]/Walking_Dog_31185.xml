  <Title>Walking Dog</Title>
  <Description>Dog ain't my "pet." He's a member of this crew, and my best friend. Saved my life more than once, you know.$B$BBut I'm gettin' too old to walk him anymore, and he still needs his exercise. Take Dog for a trip around the shelf for me, would ya?$B$BHe loves to swim through the hot geysers just southeast of the shallows.$B$BHe absolutely has to... er... "leave his mark" on the dead whale at the far western edge of the shelf.$B$BOh, and he'll want to visit our old shipwreck, too. He likes to reminisce.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take Dog to visit the hot geysers, the whale corpse, and the wreck of the Mist-Hopper on the Shelf of Mazu.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Dog deserves all the freedom the sea has to offer him - I've tried to set him free, but he won't go.$B$BBest we can do anymore is take him out for walks now and then.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>How did it go? I hope he didn't cause too much trouble!</RewardText>
