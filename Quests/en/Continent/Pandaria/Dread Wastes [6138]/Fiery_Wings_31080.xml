  <Title>Fiery Wings</Title>
  <Description>I think that old paper said something about "fiery wings." Those little dragons around here have wings. They're kind of fiery, in a way.$b$bYou're quicker than me. Try catching some of those dragons... or at least slapping the powder off of them.$b$bNo point in killing a harmless little dragon, if all you want is the sparkle from their wings.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slap Rikkilea Flitterlings, then catch 88 flecks of Flitterling Dust.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I haven't been able to catch any of those things!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>YEAH!!! FLITTERLING DUST!!!$b$b&lt;Olon throws the powder into the pot.&gt;$b$bThis brew is turning out... strange, and pretty smelly. I'm starting to think maybe Lya was right.</RewardText>
