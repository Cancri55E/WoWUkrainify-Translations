  <Title>Meltdown</Title>
  <Description>The venomsting scorpions on Zan'vess are fed sap from a young age, causing a fascinating mutation in which their natural armor plating becomes infused with amber. Effectively, it's organic kyparite, the same substance used in forging most of the empire's weapons and armor.$B$BI think I've found a way to chemically break down kyparite, but it needs testing. Use these grenades on the Zan'thik venomstings and observe the results.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 6 Zan'thik Venomstings in Zan'vess. Use Korven's Experimental Grenade to counter their armor plating.</LogDescription>
