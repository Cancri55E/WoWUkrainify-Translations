  <Title>Feed or Be Eaten</Title>
  <Description>After years of working with the Kunchong I developed a theory; raising one from infancy would strengthen the bond and therefore strengthen the sonic connection.$b$bI had just begun training Kovok when I was chosen for encasement. He is still very young and will need diligent training to reach his full potential.$b$bI'm entrusting Kovok to you, but be warned; if any harm comes to him your life is forfeit.$b$bFirst, you must feed him to gain his trust. The turtles in the area should be suitable for this.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Begin Kovok's training by feeding him 6 Succulent Turtle Filets found on the Brineshell Snappers in the Briny Muck.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Very good! I had half expected Kovok to just eat you. What a pleasant surprise to see you both in one piece.$b$bPerhaps Kunchong raising is in your blood.</RewardText>
