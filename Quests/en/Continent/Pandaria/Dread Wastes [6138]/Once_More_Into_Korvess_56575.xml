  <Title>Once More Into Kor'vess</Title>
  <Description>You found this on a member of the swarm? It seeps with corruption... and with power. We could be faced with a serious threat if the rest of the mantid's amber is similarly corrupted.

Far to the west in the Dread Wastes lies Kor'vess, a large kypari tree that provides the swarm with most of its amber. From there, we can determine just how much of their stores have been infused with the energy of the Old Gods.

I will meet you closer to the tree.</Description>
