The manipulators of the Shek'zeer are too impatient to form a proper bond with their kunchong.$B$BTheir laziness will cost them dearly.$B$BStrike this tuning fork near the dread kunchong in the clutches - watch as they reel in confusion and lash out at their masters. Use this to your advantage and put them down.</Description>
