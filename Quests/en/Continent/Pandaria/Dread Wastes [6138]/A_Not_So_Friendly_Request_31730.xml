  <Title>A Not So Friendly Request</Title>
  <Description>Scouts have reported a non-mantid presence near Kor'vess. Their intrusion and their theft of amber would normally be dealt with swiftly, but our forces are needed elsewhere.$b$bThis task seems suited to you, Wakener. You will convince them to leave this land, or you will destroy them in the name of the Klaxxi'va.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Sapmaster Vu at The Brewgarden in Dread Wastes.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So they want us to leave do they? What a selfish request! We're only taking amber from one tree.$b$bWell, I'm not going anywhere! I have brew to make.$b$bIf you help us maybe we can all come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I give them some brew, they stop trying to kill us.</RewardText>
