  <Title>Incantations Fae and Primal</Title>
  <Description>I suspect we are going to need the help of these sprites.$b$bWe have two enchanted daggers, bound together with wood and shade. Now we need someone to perform ancient "incantations" on our artifact.$b$bBefore we ask for favors, let's show the sprites that we mean well. I heard their leader talking about a pair of mistlurkers that kidnapped several of their villagers. If we slay these fog beasts... we may get the "incantation" we need in return.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Ahgunoss and Mygoness.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Nice work. I've heard the sprites talking about us.$b$bWe're getting their attention.</RewardText>
