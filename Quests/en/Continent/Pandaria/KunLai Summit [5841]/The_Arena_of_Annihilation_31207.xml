  <Title>The Arena of Annihilation</Title>
  <Description>Ah, I can still remember running fights out of a muddy hole in the ground back in Nagrand. We've come a long way, eh, Wodin?$B$BI tell you, there's nothing more these Tiger monks like than a good scrap. So much so that they've paid good coin for me to set up shop here and help draw the strongest fighters from all around!$B$BSo how about it? You and a couple friends up for a few rounds in the Arena of Annihilation...? Big money, big prizes!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Enter and complete the Arena of Annihilation scenario. Afterwards, collect your reward from Wodin the Troll-Servant.</LogDescription>
