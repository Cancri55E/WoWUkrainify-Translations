  <Title>A Terrible Sacrifice</Title>
  <Description>I have an idea, and... am prepared to make a terrible sacrifice.

As much as I know that we need my stout brew, to fortify our defenders for the long-term security of the Ox Gate...

It is too painful to discuss details now, but please - while you are up here defending the wall, gather the barrels of oil they are using to light their arrows. We will need them.</Description>
