  <Title>The Torch of Strength</Title>
  <Description>Xuen has this challenge he says helps "refine strength." I am starting to think the word "strength" means something different to him than the rest of us.$b$bHere, take this torch to the top of the gates of the temple. If you can get it there without the torch being extinguished, you pass the challenge.$b$bWhatever you do, do not try carrying the torch on a mount. It will blow out if you do. Trust me on that one.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Carry the Torch of Strength to the gates of the Temple of the White Tiger without it extinguishing.</LogDescription>
