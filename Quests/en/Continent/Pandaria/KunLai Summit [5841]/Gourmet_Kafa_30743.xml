  <Title>Gourmet Kafa</Title>
  <Description>It was genius: kafa berries go in the goot, seeds come out.$B$BKafa'kota is already rare and worth a fortune, but my invention--Kafa'goot--is GOURMET.$B$BBut it's over now. Uncle is upset and peak is a muss. All that's left is to collect the rest of the Kafa'goot and never make it again.$B$BI won't ask you to gather it--kind of a mussy task, not fit for hero-- just mark it so I can find it easily when the mountain is safe again.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Mark $1oa Kafa'goot "Deposits" on Kota Peak.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>On the bright side, Uncle Keenbean can label the last batch of Kafa'goot as "Limited Release" and sell it for even more!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Great, I'll get up there and... harvest them soon.$B$B&lt;Cousin Gootfur begins wrapping long strips of linen around his hands.&gt;$B$BCan't believe I thought this was a good idea.</RewardText>
