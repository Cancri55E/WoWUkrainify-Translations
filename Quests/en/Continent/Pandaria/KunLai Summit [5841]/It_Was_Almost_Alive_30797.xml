  <Title>It Was Almost Alive</Title>
  <Description>A ritual took place here, and from the looks of it wasn't successful.$b$bAmong the abandoned items a book lies open. The text on the pages is foreign to you.$b$bCarrying the whole book may be difficult, but a single page might be enough. If you can get the page to Lorewalker Cho he may be able to tell you what it says.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Tear a page from the open book to give to Lorewalker Cho.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What have you found, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This text is curious indeed, $n...$b$bIt appears to have been written in the Meng dynasty, but some of the symbols are wrong. I don't think the Mogu wrote this, although it is oddly close.$b$bIt will take me some time to translate. Keep moving and see if you can find anything else.</RewardText>
