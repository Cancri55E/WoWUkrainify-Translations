  <Title>To the Wall!</Title>
  <Description>They are attacking again!

&lt;Lin looks to the Ox Gate.&gt;

Archers... on the wall!

I need you to get up there. My wife Suna went to scout the wall with that fool Lao-Chen. Perhaps if he had spent more time preparing defenses and less building that ridiculous ale lift contraption...

It matters not. Get a kite from Len, to the west, and then get up there and find my wife. She'll know what to do next.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Kite Master Len at Winter's Blossom in Kun-Lai Summit to take a kite up to the Ox Gate. Once there, speak to Suna Silentstrike.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Wow, that was quite a bit of kite-flying there. Good job getting up here and not dying.

It's good you're here, too. Lao-chen's got an idea he's working on, but in the meantime we've got yaungol to deal with.</RewardText>
