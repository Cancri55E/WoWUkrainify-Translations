Plundering the tombs of their old kings for relics of power.$B$BI could not observe them long before having to flee, but I did manage to recover a relic of my own.$B$BThe Tongue of Ba-Shon will let us communicate securely over long distances, but only after I have bound it to myself.$B$BI think I'm ready to begin, if you are.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Assist Lorekeeper Cho in performing the Binding of Ba-Shon.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I'll need to bind my essence to the Tongue, then you can use it to speak with me from anywhere.</CompletionText>
