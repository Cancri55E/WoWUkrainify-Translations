  <Title>Challenge Accepted</Title>
  <Description>The yaungol have always been a difficult, proud people, but never this violent or aggressive. 

I do not know what has prompted this change in their behavior, but we don't have time to find out, now. We fear for our lives and livelihoods as long as Ur-Bataar, leader of the Bataari yaungol, lives.

Go, set the banner in his camp ablaze to challenge him, and then defeat him in battle. Only then will we be secure.</Description>

  <RewardText>You did it! At the very least, we have justice, and safety, though in the process we have lost so much.
