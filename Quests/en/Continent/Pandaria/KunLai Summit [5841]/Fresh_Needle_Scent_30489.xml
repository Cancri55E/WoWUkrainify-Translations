  <Description>Say, if you really are here to help, I could use me some needles off them sprites in Pranksters' Hollow.$b$bThe grummles don't believe in luck they can't smell. They'll pay better for yaks that have that fresh needle scent.</Description>

  <CompletionText>Mmm. Nothing like the fresh scent of needle.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You just earned me a handsome bonus. Getting those needles is a pain in the paw but worth it when we take our yaks to market. Here, for your troubles.</RewardText>
