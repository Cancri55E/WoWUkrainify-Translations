  <Title>Turnabout</Title>
  <Description>Our true enemies are the sha, not the yaungol.

The sha are emotion manifest. Destructive, yes. But undisciplined. Undisciplined force cannot last. The flood, in dispersion, loses its force. The wildfire burns its fuel.

And, discipline and wisdom can turn their destructive energy against themselves.

Bring me the essences of the sha in the village, and I will explain further.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 5 Blind Rage Essences from Blind Rages in Firebough Nook.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you harvested their essences?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good. Now you will see how to defeat unbridled rage.

I will craft these into a trap for Kobai, the leader of the yaungol. Though he will be snared, and we will defeat him, he is not our ultimate target...</RewardText>
