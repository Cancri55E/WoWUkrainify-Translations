  <Title>Lao-Chin's Gambit</Title>
  <Description>Alright. Thanks to you, we have the wall under control. Good job. 

I'll stay up here for a little while and make sure no more yaungol get up onto the wall.

You, though, should go back down and see what Lao-Chin has cooked up. I hate to say it, but maybe he had a good idea after all...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Lao-Chin the Iron Belly at Winter's Blossom in Kun-Lai Summit.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Good to see you made it back in one piece. Thanks to your help with the barrels, I've managed to brew up a good surprise for our yaungol friends at the front.</RewardText>
