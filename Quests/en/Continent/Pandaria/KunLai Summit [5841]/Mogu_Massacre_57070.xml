  <Title>Mogu Massacre</Title>
  <Description>I think this is what my friends would call a "target rich environment." As a nicer way of saying "we're surrounded and probably doomed."

You know what this means. We have to kill as many of these mogu as possible! It doesn't matter how you do it, just take them out!</Description>
