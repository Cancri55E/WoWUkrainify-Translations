  <Title>Kite Surveillance</Title>
  <Description>We heard for ourselves that there were mogu attacking, but I had no idea it would be this many!

There must be a way to stop them before they completely overrun the Vale. Quickly, let us fly over and scout out their numbers.

We just so happen to have a kite that can carry three people. Usually it's more, but I had a big lunch.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ride Chen's Kite to scout the Mogu armies.</LogDescription>
