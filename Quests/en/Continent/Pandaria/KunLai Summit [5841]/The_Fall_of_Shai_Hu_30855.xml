  <Title>The Fall of Shai Hu</Title>
  <Description>I can hear the voice of the Mere - it has been purified.

But, this chapter in my people's history will never be closed - not until we defeat Shai Hu.

Beware - he is strong. But, after all we have done, I am confident we will be stronger.</Description>

  <RewardText>Thank you, $n. You have assured that this corruption will not spread, and that my people - those who have not been corrupted - will be able to live on and found a new village.

Thank you, friend.</RewardText>
