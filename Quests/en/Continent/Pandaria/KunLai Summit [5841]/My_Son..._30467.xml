  <Title>My Son...</Title>
  <Description>My son - can you find my son?

When the Jinyu attacked, he ran off in the confusion. I don't know if they've done anything with him, or if he's still alive, even.

Nothing else matters if I can't find him. 

I'd ask Mei... but something's wrong with her. She seems too... impulsive since the attack. I just can't trust that she'd bring him back safely.</Description>
