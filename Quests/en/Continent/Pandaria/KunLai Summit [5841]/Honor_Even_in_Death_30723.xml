  <Title>Honor, Even in Death</Title>
  <Description>Hmm... If Shado-Master Chong trusted you, perhaps you can help us.

The yaungol are our enemies.

Still, we must prove we are better than they. We will show them honor in death.

As after most battles, the carrion birds have begun gathering. Thin their numbers, so the bodies of our foes will not be desecrated. They've gathered at the battlefield to the west.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 12 Kun-Lai Scavengers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Killing those birds may not soothe my anger, but at least it proves that we are better than our enemies. They would not do such a thing.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good. After what they have done, I would not show the Yaungol kindness in life. But neither will I allow their bodies to be eaten by the birds.</RewardText>
