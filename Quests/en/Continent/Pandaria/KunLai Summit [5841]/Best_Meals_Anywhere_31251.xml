  <Title>Best Meals Anywhere!</Title>
  <Description>Yeah, yeah.

Everyone knows us goblins do tinkering. And explosives. And... well, ya' know, the less reputable stuff.

But what nobody knows is that I'm really a great chef! It's a hobby of mine.

Gather us up some meaty bits from the creatures around here, and I'll cook us up the best meals ANYWHERE!

And I promise, I'll only use three or four percent rocket fuel.</Description>
