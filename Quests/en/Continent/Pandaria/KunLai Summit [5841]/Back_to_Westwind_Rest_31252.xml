  <Title>Back to Westwind Rest</Title>
  <Description>Well, far as I figure, we've got quite a lot of rebuildin' to do.

I'm not one for joining any big causes, but my farmhands aren't gonna have much to do 'round here, to be honest. And, since you helped them out, they want to join your "Alliance." So, who am I to stop 'em?

Bring 'em with you, back to Farmhand Bo. I'll miss 'em, but they're better off with you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Farmhand Bo at Westwind Rest in Kun-Lai Summit.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You did good, bringing these guys back. We'll have 'em farming you up some food in no time!</RewardText>
