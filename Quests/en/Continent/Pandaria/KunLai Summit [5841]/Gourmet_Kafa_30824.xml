  <Title>Gourmet Kafa</Title>
  <Description>It was a crazy idea: kafa berries go in the goot, seeds come out.$B$BKafa'kota is already rare and worth a fortune, but my cousin's invention--Kafa'goot--is GOURMET.$B$BBut it's over now. Uncle Keenbean is upset and peak is a muss. All that's left is to collect the rest of the Kafa'goot and never make it again.$B$BI won't ask you to gather it--kind of a mussy task, not fit for hero-- just mark it so we can find it easily when the mountain is safe again.</Description>
