  <Title>The Shado-Pan</Title>
  <Description>Our new recruits have spoken in hushed tones about a group of Pandaren they call the "Shado-Pan". They are apparently very strong, and secretive.

It's clear that, no matter what happens here in Kun-Lai, making an alliance with these Shado-Pan will be critical to our foothold in Pandaria.

That's where you come in. Rumor is they have a base of operations to the southeast, near Firebough Nook.

You will go there, and curry their favor. For the Horde!</Description>
