  <Title>Mogu?! Oh No-gu!</Title>
  <Description>I know your friends are worried about the animating statues over at Mogujia, but I'll tell you what you should really be worried about.

Where there are animated statues, there are mogu. I don't know if you've seen one before, but if you haven't...

Well, let's just say mogu are bad, bad, news.

While you're dealing with whatever else you're doing, you need to get the mogu behind the trouble!</Description>

  <LogDescription>Kill the Mogujia Soul-Caller.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find him? Is he dead? No? Oh, man. Don't make me worried!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Oh, thank goodness! You've saved all of our skins, believe me.

You have no idea how much trouble those guys can stir up.

Err, or, I guess you do, now. Kind of. Almost.

Imagine that, but a lot worse, and for a couple thousand years.</RewardText>
