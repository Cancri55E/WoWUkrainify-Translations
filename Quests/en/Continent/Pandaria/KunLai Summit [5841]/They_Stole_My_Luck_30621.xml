  <Title>They Stole My Luck!</Title>
  <Description>My journeys through Kun-Lai have taught me two things. First, never sneak up on a sleeping yak. Second, having luck on your side is both necessary and hard to come by.$b$bThe grummles believe in carrying a lucky trinket at all times. In my mind, if one trinket can sometimes bring luck, then many trinkets would guarantee it!$b$bAfter arriving in One Keg my lucky trinkets were stolen by those little menace sprites. I'd be truly grateful if you could retrieve them for me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return Ji-Lu the Lucky's Lucky Virmen's Foot, Yak Shoe, Four Winds Clover, and Gold Coin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to find my lucky trinkets? One can never have too much good luck.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you! It appears my trinkets were lucky for you too, $c. While you were gone I did not gamble and lose my cart.$b$bI would be happy to lend it to you for your journey. Besides, I have some goods to win back from this shady grummle!</RewardText>
