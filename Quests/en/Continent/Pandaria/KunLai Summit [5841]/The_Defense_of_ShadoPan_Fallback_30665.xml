  <Title>The Defense of Shado-Pan Fallback</Title>
  <Description>I sent for reinforcements from the Shado-Pan Monastery, but have heard nothing back. We have already lost the town.

A few lucky villagers may have survived, but we are pinned down here.

We do not have time to entertain strangers. If you can fight, help my men defend this tower. If not, leave, for you will not survive long here.</Description>
