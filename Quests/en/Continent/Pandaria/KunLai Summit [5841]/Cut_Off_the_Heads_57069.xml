  <Title>Cut Off the Heads</Title>
  <Description>Okay. We're stuck in the middle of three mogu armies, and Uncle Chen is too hurt to move yet.

It's not hopeless though. We have the chance to take out the leaders of these armies. Maybe that will slow them down or distract them long enough for us to get back to the gate!

See if you can get out there and take down the biggest, baddest mogu you can find. Those will be the commanders.</Description>
