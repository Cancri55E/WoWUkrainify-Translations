  <Title>Pandaren Prisoners</Title>
  <Description>Look, I know the Alliance needs recruits, and there's just not enough of us here right now to make a fighting presence of this town.

But I know that the yaungol over at Fire Camp Ordo, to the northwest, have taken many of my people as prisoners. And I also know that if you would be willing to rescue them from their captivity, they'd more than likely be willing to join the Alliance.

What do you say, $n?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Free 8 Pandaren Prisoners.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Well, if it isn't our hero, $n.

I really wasn't sure we stood a fighting chance out here, you know?

These guys may be a little rough around the edges, but we'll be able to whip 'em into shape. And when we do, we'll have a real fighting chance at holding our own here in Kun-Lai.

Good work.</RewardText>
