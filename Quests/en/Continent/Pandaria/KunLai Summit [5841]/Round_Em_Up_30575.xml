  <Title>Round 'Em Up</Title>
  <Description>Mobility is going to be key to maintaining our foothold in this new land. Problem is, there's no way to maintain mobility without mounts, and... well, we don't have many of those here, now do we?

The local yaks seem to make good mounts. At least, the local pandaren say they do. Why don't you go round some up for us?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Round up 3 Wild Plains Yaks and return them to Westwind Rest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It's going to take more yaks than that to get this place back into fightin' condition, $n, yes it is.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These yaks will do the trick nicely. Good work, $p. I'm feeling better about this whole situation already.</RewardText>
