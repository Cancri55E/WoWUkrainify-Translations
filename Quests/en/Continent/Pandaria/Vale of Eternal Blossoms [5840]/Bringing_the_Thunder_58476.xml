  <Description>All of the mogu clans are formidable, to be sure, but it is the Zan-Tien that pose the most direct threat to the Golden Lotus. 

Even now, their numbers are amassing outside the Golden Pagoda. Many of our warriors are fresh-faced and inexperienced. They would not withstand a mogu assault for long.

An experienced $c like you could serve to slow them down significantly.
