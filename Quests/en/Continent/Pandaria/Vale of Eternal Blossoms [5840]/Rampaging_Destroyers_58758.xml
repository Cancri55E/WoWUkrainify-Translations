  <Title>Rampaging Destroyers</Title>
  <Description>The last mantid swarm is still very fresh in the memory of the Golden Lotus. Prior to the advancement of the swarm, the mantid would send their massive kunchong to soften up the defenders' lines.

It would seem their tactics have not changed.

We must stop those kunchong if the Golden Lotus hope to mount a defensive against the swarm. I'm counting on you to strike them down.</Description>
