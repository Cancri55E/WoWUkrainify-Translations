  <Title>Lost Scouts</Title>
  <Description>We sent some scouts towards the Five Sisters to the north to try and find whatever mogu leader has risen up to direct their movements in the valley. Few have returned.$B$BI'd like to think they're just off downing too much ale or being irresponsible with some young pandaren, but they may actually be in some trouble.$B$BCan you scout for the scouts? And see if they've turned up any information on that leader while you're at it?</Description>
