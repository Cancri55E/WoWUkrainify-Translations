  <Title>Aggressive Notation</Title>
  <Description>Even given the Sha's origins with the Old Gods, we in Pandaria still know very little of them.

I would like to take this opportunity to add whatever information I can about them to the archives of the Lorewalkers. Of course, that becomes a bit problematic when they're trying to kill us.

That doesn't seem to be a problem for you, though. Could you do me a favor and jot down some notes about what you encounter out there?  It could help a great deal towards understanding what we're fighting.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Lorewalker's Notebook to gather notes about the faceless, k'thir, and fleshbeasts in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.</LogDescription>
