  <Title>Corrupted Curiosities</Title>
  <Description>I understand that the Black Empire poses a grave threat to Pandaria, but we may also use this as an opportunity!

Though we've faced them several times before, very little is known about the Old Gods or N'Zoth's mysterious realm of Ny'alotha. 

When studying ancient civilizations, we often rely on artifacts to unlock the deepest mysteries lost to time. I wonder if some such artifacts could be found among the Old God's forces?

It can't hurt to check, right?</Description>
