  <Title>The Mantid Threat</Title>
  <Description>The mantid have been corrupting their kypari trees to imbue their amber with power from N'Zoth. The swarm is enough of a menace on its own. N'Zoth could transform them into something even more dire.

The Shado-Pan need to hear about this. I suggest you bring this information to your other allies as well.</Description>
