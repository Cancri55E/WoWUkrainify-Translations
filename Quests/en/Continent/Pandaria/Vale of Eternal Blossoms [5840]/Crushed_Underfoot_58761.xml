  <Title>Crushed Underfoot</Title>
  <Description>In the past, the mantid would safeguard their hatchlings in incubation chambers until they were ready to be tested in the swarm. 

These Vil'thik are sloppy, however, allowing their larvae to scurry out in the open. 

Wouldn't it be a shame if someone crushed them?

No, of course it wouldn't.</Description>
