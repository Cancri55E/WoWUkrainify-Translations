  <Title>Runelocked</Title>
  <Description>Hello, friend.$B$BOne of Leven's men brought word to me of a mogu artifact in the eastern ruins, but said he couldn't figure out how to retrieve it. I suspect it's guarded by one of their rune locks.$B$BIf you go to the artifact, you should find four runes somewhere nearby that when activated will release the lock. If you could bring the artifact back to me, I would be very grateful.</Description>
