  <Title>So You Want to Be a Blacksmith...</Title>
  <Description>While it is best to learn the properties of simpler metals and work your way up, it is possible to learn how to become a good blacksmith through mastering the various applications of ghost iron for common household objects. If you wish to take this path towards becoming a zen master blacksmith, I can teach you. Whichever way you choose, you will have my respect if you can show me that you can make a ghostly skeleton key.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Create a Ghostly Skeleton Key by attaining at least 500 skill in blacksmithing. If you wish to train through pandaren materials, a training project appropriate to your skill level can be learned from Jorunga Stonehoof.</LogDescription>
