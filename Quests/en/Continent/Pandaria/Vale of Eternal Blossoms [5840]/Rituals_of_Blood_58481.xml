  <Title>Rituals of Blood</Title>
  <Description>Anji and I have fought in many battles, so we know how to handle a few mogu, but the blood magic used by these Dokani is just unsettling!

As if it weren't bad enough for them to kill everyone in their path, but to use their corpses to fuel their unholy rituals? I just can't stomach it!

Do me a favor. If you ever come across any of these rituals, put a stop to them! Even our enemies don't deserve to be defiled with their dark magic.</Description>
