  <Title>Taken by the Swarm</Title>
  <Description>There's something different about this mantid swarm. Instead of just killing everything in sight like the mantid usually do, they've taken to capturing our defenders and holding them alive.

I really don't want to know what they have in store for the captives. 

Why don't you go rescue them so we don't have to find out?</Description>
