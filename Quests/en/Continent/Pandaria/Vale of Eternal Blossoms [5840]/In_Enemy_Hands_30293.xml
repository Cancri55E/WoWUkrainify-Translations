Get down there and kill the mogu that are controlling them, but don't kill the defenders! Killing their captors should free them from their mind control.$B$BSooner would be better. Anji might try to go down there to help soon, and her ability to restrain herself when in the heat of things is not one of the qualities I married her for.</Description>
