  <Title>Siege Breaker</Title>
  <Description>The Golden Lotus can hold their own against the mantid's warriors, of that I have no doubt. Their war wagons, on the other hand, have the capability of crippling an entire squad of our fighters in a single volley.

If we wish to maintain the upper hand in this battle, we will need someone to infiltrate their positions and sabotage their siege engines.

I would like you to volunteer.</Description>
