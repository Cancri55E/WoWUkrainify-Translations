  <Description>The mantid use amber in nearly all aspects of their lives, from the structures they live in to the weapons they wield. Of course, I'm more interested in the latter.

If we can deprive the mantid of their materials, we will deprive them of their means to create implements of war.

Find where they keep their amber and make sure they are unable to use it.</Description>
