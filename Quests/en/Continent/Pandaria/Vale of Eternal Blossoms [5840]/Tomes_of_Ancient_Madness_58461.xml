  <Title>Tomes of Ancient Madness</Title>
  <Description>In times like these, it becomes necessary for all of the denizens of the Vale to pitch in and do their part. Unfortunately, I have never been much of a fighter, so my usefulness in times of war is limited.

However, I may be able to do some good. You see, we know very little about the invaders we face, and knowledge can be a very powerful weapon.

I think I have seen tomes carried by some of the k'thir. If you could bring some to me, I may be able to glean something useful from their writings.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Tomes of Ancient Madness from k'thir enemies in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.</LogDescription>
