  <Description>To see the Vale of Eternal Blossoms recover from the Sha to its former beauty, only to see it tainted by the Old Gods once more, it makes the blood boil!

We must root out the Old God's corruption before it can take hold of this land again. I have seen the fleshbeasts that accompany N'Zoth's forces spreading his corruption where they tread.

Make sure they tread no longer.</Description>
