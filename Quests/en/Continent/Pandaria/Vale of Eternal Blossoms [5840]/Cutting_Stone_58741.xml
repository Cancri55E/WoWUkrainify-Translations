  <Title>Cutting Stone</Title>
  <Description>One problem with waging war against other mogu is that weapons dull and break very quickly when used against foes of stone and metal. 

Being the sole blacksmith among the Rajani, it is sometimes difficult to keep up with our warriors needs.

If you come across any weapons in your battles with the mogu, I'm sure I could put them to good use.</Description>
