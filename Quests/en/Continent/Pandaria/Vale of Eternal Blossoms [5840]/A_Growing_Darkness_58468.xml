  <Description>Shado-Pan scouts have spotted evidence of a new mantid hatchery within the Big Blossom mine. It seems these Deephive mantid are looking to create new corrupted spawn to serve N'Zoth.

If these eggs were allowed to hatch, a new swarm empowered by the Old God could blacken the skies of the Vale and plunge Pandaria into darkness.

We will not allow that to happen, will we?</Description>
