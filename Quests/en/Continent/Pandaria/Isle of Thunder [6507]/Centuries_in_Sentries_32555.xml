  <Title>Centuries in Sentries</Title>
  <Description>Sacrifices are common place in Zandalari society. There is however one oddity among these barbaric rituals; volunteers. They treat it as a great honor!$b$bThe weak still seek to contribute, even if that means giving their lives to be bound to the sentries you see walking around. Locked away in service to their people.$b$bTake this resonating crystal. Once destroyed, drain the sentry of its Zandalari inhabitant. Return the crystal to me when your task is complete.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 5 Spirit-Bound Sentries and then use the Resonance Crystal to capture the Zandalari spirits trapped within.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This is very interesting, $c. The crystal hums with the rage of its captive inhabitants. Even after the passage of time their devotion has not decreased.$b$bI will need to study this further.</RewardText>
