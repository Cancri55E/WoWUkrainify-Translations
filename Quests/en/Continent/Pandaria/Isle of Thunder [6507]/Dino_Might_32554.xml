  <Description>The Zandalari use a series of fetishes and charms to maintain their control over their menagerie of beasts.$b$bTwo can play at that game.$b$bI want you to find some of these fetishes and try them out on the various beasts in the Beast Pens.$b$bTake careful note of how each beast responds to each fetish. Then report your results to me.$b$bMaybe this will give us the edge we need against the Zandalari.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find and use Saur Fetishes on 5 raptors, compies, skyscreamers or direhorns in the Beast Pens.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Very interesting results. I am sure there is a mage somewhere that cares about the specifics. I, on the other hand, am just glad to hear the sound of trolls being assaulted by their own beasts.</RewardText>
