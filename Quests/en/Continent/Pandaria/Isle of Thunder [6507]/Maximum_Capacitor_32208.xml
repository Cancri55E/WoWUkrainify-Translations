  <Description>The mines north of here are being used to extract Ghost Iron ore and energize it with lightning energy.

Oh - and while you're there, take out whoever is running the operation.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Interact with the three lightning drills in the Ghost Iron Mines to destroy them, and kill Metal Lord Mono-Han.</LogDescription>
