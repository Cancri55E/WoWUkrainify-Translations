  <Title>Save Our Scouts!</Title>
  <Description>The heavy mogu presence in the mines let us know it was a place of great importance - but we needed to gather more information on their activities there, so we sent agents into the mines to spy on them.

Unfortunately, many were captured, and we've found that some are being tortured in the mines. You have to go rescue them - nobody deserves what they are going through...

And, when you finish, kill whoever captured them. No mercy, $p!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rescue the three captured Sunreaver agents within the Ghost Iron Mines, and kill Metal Lord Mono-Han.</LogDescription>
