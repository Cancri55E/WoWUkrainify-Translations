  <Title>Disarming Irony</Title>
  <Description>Well, it would seem the Lady Proudmoore has decided to use our own weaponry against us. Our perimeter wards reported several spies slipping through our defenses carrying tactical mana bombs.$b$bI would enjoy the irony if these bombs were less dangerous.$b$bSearch for these bombs and disarm them. Our wards reported one near the horde ships to the north, one on a bridge to the main isle, and one near our scrying crystals on the eastern side of the Promontory.</Description>
