  <Title>What's Inside Counts</Title>
  <Description>I noticed something strange on my last scouting mission. A group of Zandalari are performing a ritual on what appears to be a very large sentry. They may be trying to re-animate it.$b$bWe need that ritual stopped and the sentry destroyed. Anything that large can't be good.$b$bI've sent a scout ahead to observe their actions. Meet with her and figure out how to stop them.</Description>
