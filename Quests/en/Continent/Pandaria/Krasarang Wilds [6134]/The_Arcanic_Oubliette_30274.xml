  <Title>The Arcanic Oubliette</Title>
  <Description>An Alliance member? Here? Elune be praised.$b$bMy team has encountered a snag. We opened a portal to this land using some ancient scrolls we had found that predated Azshara's rule.$b$bUnfortunately, the coordinates provided on the tablets were warded and the portal that meant to take us to our destination landed us in this oubliette.$b$bWe have been trapped here for days, and it is slowly leaching our energies to power itself.$b$bCan you find the nearby shackles that bind the oubliette and disable them?</Description>
