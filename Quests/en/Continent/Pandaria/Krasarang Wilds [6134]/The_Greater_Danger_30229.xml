  <Description>I apologize for my harsh words earlier. Dezco might have been right to wait and move west with a unified strength.$b$bThe mogu hit us hard when we were searching the ruins west of here. They ambushed us using summoning portals and some dark magics. I haven't seen such evil sorcery used since Outland. $b$bWe need a respite. Head west, kill their summoners, cut their supply line.</Description>
