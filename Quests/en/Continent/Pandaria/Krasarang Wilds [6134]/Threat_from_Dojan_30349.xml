  <Title>Threat from Dojan</Title>
  <Description>While you were at the ruins dusting off tablets for my father I lost five scouts to wandering mogu patrols.$b$bThese creatures apparently have little interest in peace and are about as trustworthy as the Horde.$b$bThey are too numerous and we are too weak, however.$b$bGo to the ruins west of here and cull the mogu numbers. They won't be expecting a $c.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 6 Dojani Reclaimers, 8 Dojani Surveyors, and 4 Dojani Enforcers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Kang has been sharing stories with me about these mogu.$b$bApparently ages ago they ruled as emperors subjugating all free races of Pandaria and the surrounding regions. Now they are little more than hoodlums.$b$bTo see these mogu fight though, I suspect they are trying to rekindle some of their older ideals and ambitions.</CompletionText>
