  <Title>Crane Mastery</Title>
  <Description>Thing about hunting birds is you need ammo - and I ain't got any. Thing about hunting with Nesingwary is you need to prove you can keep your tally and bragging rights up.$b$bCan't hunt, can't brag. And I like bragging so this is no good.$b$bCan I hire you to go kill me some carp hunters? You'll find them up and down the river west of here. There are a bunch of them so don't hesitate to hunt while doing other stuff.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 12 Carp Hunters.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>As far as I'm concerned, paying you to kill these birds is the same as me shooting them myself. You just get to be my gun as it were.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Fantastic. Only thing that would make this hunting trip more entertaining is a chair. Here is the reward I promised you.</RewardText>
