  <Title>Tread Lightly</Title>
  <Description>My students tell me the surrounding area is littered with deadly traps, no doubt set by the saurok. Stumbling into one gets you a face full of spikes.$B$BAs the saying goes: "The Way is rife with danger - tread lightly, and with scrutiny."$B$B&lt;Koro hands you a long tree branch.&gt;$B$BHere, this is scrutiny.$B$BIt should be long enough to set the traps off at a safe distance.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use "Scrutiny" to set off 10 Riverblade Spike Traps from a safe distance.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Well, I don't see any spikes in your face. That's a good sign.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Every trap you sprang is a life saved, be it pandaren, beast, or otherwise. Nobody deserves an honorless death like that.</RewardText>
