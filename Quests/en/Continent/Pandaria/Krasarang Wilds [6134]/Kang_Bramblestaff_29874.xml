  <Title>Kang Bramblestaff</Title>
  <Description>Kang's pride regularly becomes overconfidence, which often leads him down dangerous paths. His current path is as dangerous as any - he is headed deep into the Krasarang Wilds.$b$bI wouldn't normally ask a favor of a stranger, but... would you make sure that he is well? It would give me relief to know that a brave $r was looking out for him.</Description>
