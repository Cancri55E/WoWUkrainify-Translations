  <Title>Ken-Ken</Title>
  <Description>So... Ken-Ken. The hozen.$b$bPersonally, I'm impressed he's progressed so far in his training. He's got a brain between his ears, which is more than can be said for most of his kind.$b$bHe said he was headed east, but, seeing as we're already on the far east side of the valley, I can't imagine he went too far from here. Look for him at Zhu's Watch, in Krasarang Wilds, down the path to the south. See what he's found.</Description>
