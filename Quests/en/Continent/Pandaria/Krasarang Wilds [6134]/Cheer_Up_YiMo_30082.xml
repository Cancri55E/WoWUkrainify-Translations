  <Title>Cheer Up, Yi-Mo</Title>
  <Description>Ever since this storm began, I've just been... tired.$B$BNot physically... no. It's like my very soul is exhausted. Worthless. Hopeless. I imagine it's what one feels when a mate leaves them for someone with a rounder belly, but I've never had a mate so how would I know?$B$BHow can I claim to know anything? I'm worthless to everyone but these thunderbirds. At least they'll have a good meal out of me.$B$B&lt;Yi-Mo sighs deeply and continues staring off into the sky. It doesn't look like he's going anywhere.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Yi-Mo Longbrow back to Zhu's Watch.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I can't believe he was actually going to do that... This despair is worse than I had even imagined.$B$BI cannot thank you enough for bringing him back.</RewardText>
