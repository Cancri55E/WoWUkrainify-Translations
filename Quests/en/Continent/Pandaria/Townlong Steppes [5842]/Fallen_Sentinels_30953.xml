  <Title>Fallen Sentinels</Title>
  <Description>Our sentinels can fight for days on end, but even they have their limits. Since the mantid swarm began, too many of them have pushed themselves beyond their abilities.$b$bPlease, aid them in whatever way you can. If you are unable to heal them yourself, you may give them some of this. A mouthful of nutritious yak's milk will give them the strength they need.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Heal 8 Wounded Niuzao Sentinels above 50% health. You may use the Yak's Milk Flasks or your own healing spells and abilities.</LogDescription>
