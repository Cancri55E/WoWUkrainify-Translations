  <Title>The Enemy of My Enemy... Is Still My Enemy!</Title>
  <Description>The mantid are our enemies. As are the yaungol at Fire Camp Gai-Cho.

It is fortunate, then, that they are also each other's enemies. Mantid from Kri'vess constantly attack the Gai-Cho yaungol, who hold them off at their front gates.

I want you to wreak havoc. "Borrow" some highly explosive oil barrels from camp Gai-Cho, and toss them down onto the battlefield from the air.

I don't care which ones you kill, just kill a lot of them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Highly Explosive Yaungol Oil Barrels to kill 100 mantid or yaungol on the Gai-Cho Battlefield.</LogDescription>
