  <Title>The Terrible Truth</Title>
  <Description>It is with a heavy heart that I confirm your suspicions. The mantid are indeed under the sway of the Sha of Fear.$b$bIt was OUR sworn duty to confine that creature beneath our temple. Unfortunately, our vigil faltered, our defenses buckled, and the sha escaped. It is with the mantid now.$b$bSee for yourself. The mantid burrowed into the western side of our island.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Investigate the Niuzao Catacombs, then slay the Dread Shadow that dwells within.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Let me make this clear... that creature was NOT the Sha of Fear. Simply a shadow... a fraction of the sha's true power.$b$bNo, the Sha of Fear is with the mantid now. The elders of my order need to be informed of this immediately.$b$bI will handle the rest from here. Thank you for your assistance, $r. Once again, your kind proves to be an asset to Pandaria.</RewardText>
