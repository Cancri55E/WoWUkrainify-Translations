  <Description>Lin...

I don't care what Ban, Lao-Chin, or even Taran Zhu says. I'm moving ahead into Townlong. I may not be able to save Lin myself, but I'm not going to sit around waiting for everyone else to catch up.

Once Taran Zhu opens the doors to his precious monastery, we'll save Lin. Until then, I'll scout ahead and make sure he's alright.</Description>
