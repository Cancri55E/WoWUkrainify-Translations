  <Description>Our patron Niuzao is a mountain on wheels... very difficult to move, even more difficult to stop. My point: once we get him moving, the mantid will have their arms full trying to slow him down.$b$bThe easiest way to get him moving is to put food in front of him. Luckily for us, food in our temple is plentiful... even in wartime.$b$bI will send one of my strongarms with you, to shoulder the load.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 6 stores of Niuzao Food. Your Niuzao Strongarm will carry the food for you.</LogDescription>
