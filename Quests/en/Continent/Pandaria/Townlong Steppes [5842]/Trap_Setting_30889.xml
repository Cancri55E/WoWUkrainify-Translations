  <Description>Good to meet you, $c. We have traps all along the pass to help us catch mantid that might be sneaking through, but their numbers have been so great that most of the traps have already been triggered.$B$BTaoshi said you might be able to reset some of them while you're out there. Can you help?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rearm 8 Shado-Pan Spike Traps.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>These traps have been very effective, the mantid numbers are just getting out of hand in these past weeks.</CompletionText>
