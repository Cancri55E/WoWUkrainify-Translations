  <Title>Mogu Incursions</Title>
  <Description>We've heard reports of a group of Mogu infiltrating the coast here in Townlong. I have no idea what they are doing. Frankly, I don't care. 

You've proven yourself, so we've decided to give this mission to you.

What's going to happen is this - you're going to go, find them, and kill them.

Our scouts reported the first group landed to the north, between here and Deadtalker's Plateau. Go there and wipe them out.</Description>
