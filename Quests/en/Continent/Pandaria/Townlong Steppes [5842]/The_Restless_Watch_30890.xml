  <Title>The Restless Watch</Title>
  <Description>I'm being told that our scouts have been on duty in Shallowstep Pass for more than 2 days straight, no rest. No wonder mantid are slipping through. Even the most dedicated scouts would slip with those kinds of shifts.$B$BI want you to go out there and deliver orders to the scouts that they are to return to the battlefront immediately for rest and rations. I'll arrange for a new shift to be posted.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver return orders to Scout Wei-Chin, Scout Long, Scout Ying, and Scout Jai-Gan.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>This whole battlefront is being worked to the bone. We need more men out here.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you. I'll have the new scouts at their posts shortly.</RewardText>
