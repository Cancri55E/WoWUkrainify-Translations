  <Title>Up In Flames</Title>
  <Description>The mantid coming across the bridge have thick carapaces that shrug off most of our attacks. They have a weakness though: fire.$B$BLao-Chen's men brought kegs to the battlefield for exactly this purpose.  Kick the kegs into groups of mantid, and Lao-Chin's archers will light them up.$B$BThey should be easy to finish off from there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Kor'thik Timberhusks with the aid of Lao-Chin's kegs.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Creative solution.  Lao-Chin impresses.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We have the added benefit that the mantid will leave with broken morale after watching their brethren burn to death.  Grim, but many lives will be spared if they simply stop pressing our lines.</RewardText>
