  <Title>The Search for Restless Leng</Title>
  <Description>One of my best scouts, Restless Leng, went missing during a mission on the other side of Sik'vess. I'm hopeful that he was captured rather than killed, but with the mantid corrupted so heavily by sha, it doesn't seem likely.$B$BStill, can you investigate the cages around Sik'vess? I owe him a more thorough search than even this, but I have no men to spare without allowing our southern lines to break.$B$BPlease, $c, even if there's no life left in him, find him that I might know his fate.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search Sik'thik Cages for Restless Leng.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find him?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Leng told me of your heroics. He is in your debt, as am I.</RewardText>
