  <Title>A Trail of Fear</Title>
  <Description>You now know Niuzao's secret. We are not only the wardens of this temple... we were the wardens of the Sha of Fear that was buried beneath it.$b$bThe Sha itself may have escaped... but it left traces behind. If you're truly going down into the catacombs, you should eliminate those traces, before they escape and cause greater problems than those we already face.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 12 Dreadlings within the Niuzao Catacombs.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Even among our own order, only a few chosen elders knew of our sacred duty to contain the Sha of Fear.$b$bWhy they chose to tell the yak-keeper, I may never know.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We already have mantid, mogu, and yaungol to worry about. This sha problem needs to be nipped in the bud before even we are overrun.</RewardText>
