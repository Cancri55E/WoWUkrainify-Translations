  <Title>Seeking Father</Title>
  <Description>I've searched everywhere... but I haven't found my father. I KNOW he's alive still. He just needs his crossbow... then he'll be OK.$b$bI've heard that you Shado-Pan guys sometimes fight the mantid on Sra'vess. I don't have any way of getting there. If you ever go over there, can you look for my dad?</Description>
