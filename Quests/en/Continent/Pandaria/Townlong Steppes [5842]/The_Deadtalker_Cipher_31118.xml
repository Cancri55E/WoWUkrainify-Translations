  <Title>The Deadtalker Cipher</Title>
  <Description>We need to understand what went wrong with the Deadtalkers. 

For so many years, the Deadtalkers were simply responsible for maintaining the burial grounds and holding funerals for fallen warriors.

From a recent raid, we've recovered a tablet from the grounds that is clearly written using a cipher, but it isn't one we've encountered before. If you can gather a ciphered scroll from one of the Deadtalkers, we can begin to put together the cypher and understand what's happened.</Description>
