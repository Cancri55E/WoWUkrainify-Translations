  <Title>The Field Armorer</Title>
  <Description>The Shado-Pan fight. As such, their armor often gets cut, scratched, torn, and burned. And it's my job to repair it.$b$bI'm no armorer, but I can repair a broken piece of mail as long as the hole's not too big.$b$bI prefer to use shell fragments from the tortoises that live in the wild fields to the northeast. Get some for me, and I can keep more Shado-Pan armored and alive.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 120 Rankbite Shell Fragments.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I refuse to let one of our kind fall just because of a broken set of armor.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent. I'll get to repairing the armor tonight, once most everyone's returned.</RewardText>
