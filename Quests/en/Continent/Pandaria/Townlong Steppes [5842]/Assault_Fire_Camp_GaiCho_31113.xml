  <Title>Assault Fire Camp Gai-Cho</Title>
  <Description>The Yaungol are a constant nuisance, but the group at Fire Camp Gai-Cho, to the northeast, conspired with the Osul yaungol in their recent incursion into Kun-Lai.

We cannot allow such an incursion to go unpunished.

Go, attack Fire Camp Gai-Cho. We need to make sure they remain occupied, so that they cannot rise up and threaten The Ox Gate again.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 16 Gai-Cho Yaungol, Earthtalkers or Pitchthrowers.</LogDescription>
