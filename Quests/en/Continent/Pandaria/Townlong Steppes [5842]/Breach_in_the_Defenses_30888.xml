  <Title>Breach in the Defenses</Title>
  <Description>Normally, it only takes a few scouts to hold this pass. Most of this territory is in sight of the wall, so archers would devastate any mantid force attempting to push through here. The problem is, most of the archers are occupied with the onslaught at the gate.$B$BTake this flare - it will help you locate the mantid that are sneaking through the eastern pass under our diminished watch. Kill any you find. We can't let them lay a trail that might lead the mantid swarms farther into the steppes.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Shado-Pan Flare to aid in killing 10 Krik'thik Scentlayers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The defenders on the wall are stretched thin. The Yaungol are pushing through the gates to Kun-Lai in the north. The mantid are pouring against the gates to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. I hear that there's been a breach into the Valley of Four Winds in the south too.$B$BWe do not have the men to combat all of these threats.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There are more getting through than I thought. I may need to stay here and clean up a while.$B$BYou've done more than your part though, $c. Thank you.</RewardText>
