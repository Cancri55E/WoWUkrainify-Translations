  <Description>A swirling mist envelops the coin and it begins to float above your hand. The mist briefly parts to reveal a shiny new coin, yet in the next instant the coin appears worn from years of exchange. As the coin settles back in to your hand, visions of jungles and mist shrouded peaks waft into your mind, and through the vision you recognize the four Celestials gathered in the courtyard of an island.</Description>
