They can be found hidden away in small caches, or gathered from creatures all around the island. Larger, rarer creatures are a better source of coins - you may find it profitable to venture forth as part of a group.$b$bIntroduce yourself to Mistweavers Ai and Ku across the Celestial Court, and gather some coins for me.</Description>
