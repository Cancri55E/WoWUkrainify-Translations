  <Title>One Final Turn</Title>
  <Description>I do not wish to ask this of you again, but I do not know who I can trust any longer. I have been using the Vision of Time to gather information, and in my searches, I believe I have found another crux in time. It is in the Caverns of Time itself.$b$bI did not want to believe it when the vision first came to me, but I cannot sit idly by and let this information pass. The Caverns of Time - you must go there, now, and use the Vision of Time.$b$bMove quickly!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Vision of Time in the Caverns of Time in Tanaris.</LogDescription>
