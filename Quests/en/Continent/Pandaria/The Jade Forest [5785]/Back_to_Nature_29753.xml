  <Title>Back to Nature</Title>
  <Description>I'm afraid I have another favor to ask, $n.$B$BThe bottles you recovered contain neither the spirits of mogu ancestors nor recently slain foes; they contain spirits of beasts. It seems the spiritclaws have resorted to poaching in an effort to fuel their simulacra.$B$BThis complicates our task, for I cannot take the beasts with me through the bridge.$B$BTake the bottles west to Tideview Thicket and smash them to return the spirits to nature. Some may be blind with rage and will need to be subdued.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Throw Spirit Bottles on the ground in Tideview Thicket to release 8 Beast Spirits.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do not fear for the spirits of the beasts - they will find peace here.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Their bodies had long since returned to the land - their spirits can now follow.</RewardText>
