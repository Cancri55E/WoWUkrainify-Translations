  <Title>Ritual Artifacts</Title>
  <Description>So many spirits held in captivity here... I can feel them everywhere. Even the walls are a cage for the long-dead.$B$B$n, we cannot simply break the sorcery over this place - doing so would release countless agonized souls to wander the earth. They will need a beacon, something to guide them.$B$BWith your help, I can create a tan-chao: a bridge from this world to the heavens. For this ritual, I'll need a bowl, a candle, and a jade cong. You should be able to find them all within the ruins.</Description>
