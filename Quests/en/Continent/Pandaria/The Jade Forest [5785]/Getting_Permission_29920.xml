  <Title>Getting Permission</Title>
  <Description>My love, Lo, tried to get permission to marry me from the pandriarchs. Though they have passed beyond, their favor would carry a lot of weight.$b$bThing is, they are spirits, and none of the gifts or tributes we brought impress them. To win their favor they claimed that either Lo or a champion must defeat them in single combat.$b$bLo is a good man, but not a fighter.$b$bWould you be our champion?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Challenge and defeat Pandriarch Goldendraft, Pandriarch Windfur, and Pandriarch Bramblestaff.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Each of the pandriarchs earned their reputation in life and retained them afterward.  I can't even imagine how you will defeat them.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>They... they agreed?! Fantastic! Thank you so much! With their blessing we can be the happiest pandaren in all the land!$b$bPlease, take this. We meant it to be a tribute for the pandriarchs but they didn't seem interested.</RewardText>
