  <Title>Hozen Aren't Your Friends, Hozen Are Your Enemies</Title>
  <Description>We've located an Alliance wreck to the south. Unfortunately, the locals have informed us that it's currently being scavenged by a group of creatures called "hozen."

By pillaging our wrecked ships, these creatures have already shown that they aren't friendly. We can't have them taking spoils from our ships, stealing our supplies, and worse, potentially capturing or killing any survivors.

Get down there and take them out! When you're done, meet up with Nodd Codejack, our SI:7 agent in the area.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 14 Hozen at the Wreck of the Vanguard.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Good work. Dirty creatures trying to kick us when we're down... 

That'll teach 'em to try and salvage an Alliance vessel!</RewardText>
