  <Description>Those "orc" things ransacked the brewery and made off with my family's finest barrels of cider.$B$BI know there is a war out there, but I am not a brewer who will stand idly by while his prized vintage is chugged by undeserving lips.$B$BThe "Horde" will likely put up some resistance. Why don't you put that weapon to good use and help me recover my cider?</Description>
