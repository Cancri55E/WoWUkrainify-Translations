  <Description>We've learned that their captain has barricaded himself in above us.$b$bThe coward allowed his forces to die while he hid from our fury! Typical Alliance! No matter. He cannot delay his fate any longer.$b$bI will scale the walls with my marines while you lead a frontal assault up the ramps. Use your flare gun on munitions near the barricades to blast your way through.$b$bWe will meet you up top and destroy this pathetic excuse for a captain together!</Description>
