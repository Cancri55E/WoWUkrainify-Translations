  <Description>I spotted some shoulder-mounted rocket launchers on the way over here.$b$bThey mighta been fireworks. I dunno. I'm just going to assume that they were shoulder-mounted rocket launchers until I'm proven wrong.$b$bPoint is, in the arms of a skilled $c like you, they could probably take down a chopper. If you find any lying around, try pointing them at those poorly-built gyrocopters.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Pick up Requisitioned Fireworks Launchers in Strongarm Airstrip, then use them on 12 Strongarm Gyrocopters.</LogDescription>
