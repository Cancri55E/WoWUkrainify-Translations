  <Description>I've scouted the area and found no leads on the prince or Admiral Taylor. We need to neutralize this base quickly and continue our search elsewhere.$B$BOperations here are being led by an orc warlock; Ga'trul. He's barricaded the dock and is trying to escape through a demonic circle.$B$BPut that flaregun to work again and blow those barricades! I'll cover your back and move in when you reach Ga'trul.</Description>
