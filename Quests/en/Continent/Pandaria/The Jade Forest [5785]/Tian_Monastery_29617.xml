  <Title>Tian Monastery</Title>
  <Description>People come from all over Pandaria to train at the Tian Monastery, just to the north of here. Probably because they never turn anybody down. They'll accept jinyu, hozen... or even a foreign $r like you!$b$bMy childhood friend, Lin, just joined the monastery's order a few weeks ago. If you're interested in learning how our monks train, maybe you should go talk with her!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Lin Tenderpaw at the Tian Monastery in the Jade Forest.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You've arrived at an exciting time. High Elder Cloudfall has agreed to take on a new class of trainees within the monastery. This could be my big chance to finally learn how to fight!</RewardText>
