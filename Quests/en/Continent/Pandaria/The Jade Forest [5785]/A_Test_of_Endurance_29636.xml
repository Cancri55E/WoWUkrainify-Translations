  <Title>A Test of Endurance</Title>
  <Description>I have taught you everything that I can, $n. It is time you spoke with Instructor Myang.$b$bThe fights that she stages are less traditional than the sparring matches I am used to. Nevertheless, the path of a traveling adventurer like yourself is unpredictable, and a broad knowledge of fighting styles is an admirable trait.$b$bFarewell, $n, and best of luck on the remainder of your training.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Report to Instructor Myang on the western side of the Tian Monastery.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Greetings, $n. You are becoming quite famous among the trainees here. I have already heard your name whispered several times, usually between the puffy and discolored lips one of your sparring partners.$b$bI'm looking forward to working with you.</RewardText>
