  <Title>Spitfire</Title>
  <Description>We've tended these orchards and made cider from their nectar for generations. In that time, we've learned a special trick for putting out fires in a pinch.$B$B&lt;Hanae pushes a jug of cider into your hand.&gt;$B$BThe cider itself - when mixed with crushed gingerleaf and saliva - quickly becomes sticky and viscous. Perfect for smothering flames.$B$BPlease, while you're out there, try to get the flames under control. I've already mixed in the gingerleaf, just swig and spit.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Nectarbreeze Cider to put out 12 fires around Nectarbreeze Orchard.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Best not to judge our prized cider by its flavor in this state.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>A survivor came in moments ago and said the flames are beginning to die down.$B$BWe owe our very way of life to you, stranger. I cannot possibly reward you adequately, but please take this.</RewardText>
