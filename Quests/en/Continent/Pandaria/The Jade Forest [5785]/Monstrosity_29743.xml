Clearly, this land has a deep history, which means it could not have been born of the cataclysm.$b$bAnd yet these waters have been explored for ages now, with no record of anything here but open sea.$b$bPerhaps if you were to sketch the pieces of this broken statue, you might shed light on the continent's origins.</Description>
