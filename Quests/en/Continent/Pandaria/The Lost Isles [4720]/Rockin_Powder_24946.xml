  <Title>Rockin' Powder</Title>
  <Description>I'll give these pygmies one thing... they sure know how to party! But they're not so clever. I think I've discovered the source of their rockin' powers: Rockin' Powder!$B$BIt turns out that this stuff, which turns them into world-class rockers, is also highly explosive. We must have it!$B$BSo, while you're in there at Oostan to the east, make sure that you pickup a whole bunch of the stuff. Trust me, you're going to need it for what's coming up!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 5 scoops of Rockin' Powder.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hmm, let me see how much you've got.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This will do. In fact, it's more than we need. I devised an ingenious idea for a weapon that the boots will be turned into once you get them to Hobart.$B$BHand the powder over and I'll load it into the Super Booster Rocket Boots.</RewardText>
