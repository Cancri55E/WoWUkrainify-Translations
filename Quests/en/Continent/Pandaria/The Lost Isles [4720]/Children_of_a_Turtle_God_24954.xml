  <Title>Children of a Turtle God</Title>
  <Description>Volcanoth is the turtle god in the cave that these primitives worship.$B$BIt's not really a god.$B$B&lt;Hobart rolls his eyes.&gt;$B$BBut it is tough enough that I'm going to have to devise a new weapon for you from the one functioning boot we have left.$B$BI think that the age-old motto of "fight fire with fire" applies here. Plus, I like fire!$B$BLet's get some fire glands from Volcanoth's children. That should give me time to modify the rocket boot into something more fitting.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 5 Fire Glands.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>No time like the present to be done with the simple task I put before you, $n. Wouldn't you agree?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Careful with those glands, $n, careful!$B$B&lt;Grapplehammer's eyes light up at the sight of the fiery organs.&gt;$B$BAnd now to load them into the refashioned shredder boot. I'm certain that you'll be surprised and amazed by my genius invention.</RewardText>
