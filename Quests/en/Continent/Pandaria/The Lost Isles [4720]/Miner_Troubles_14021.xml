You can see my predicament, $n.$B$B&lt;The foreman lowers his voice.&gt;$B$BThese guys are nowhere near as good as my old group of jungle trolls. Ah, those were the days.$B$BMaybe you can escort my last miner here through the cavern and keep those monkeys off of him? We need that kaja'mite!</Description>

  <CompletionText>How did it go? How much kaja'mite were you able to get?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We've hit the mother lode!!!$B$BNow, what's all this about a pygmy witchdoctor in charge of the monkeys? Is he dead? Because if he's dead, then legally I can stake my claim... not that I wasn't going to do that anyway. By goblin law, all kaja'mite belongs to us!</RewardText>
