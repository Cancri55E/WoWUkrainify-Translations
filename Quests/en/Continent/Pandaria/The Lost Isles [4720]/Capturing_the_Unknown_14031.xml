  <Title>Capturing the Unknown</Title>
  <Description>Heya, $n, there are strange cave paintings and other artifacts all over the cavern.$B$BDo you think you could use your belt-mounted KTC Snapflash camera to capture images at the designated spots? Also, snap a pic of the altar in the back of the cavern.$B$BI'm sure that Sassy will want the intel.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Using your KTC Snapflash, capture images at the bouncing cameras of the three cave paintings and the pygmy altar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>What are these?$B$B&lt;Sassy examines the pictures while listening to your tale from the Kaja'mite cavern.&gt;$B$BClearly that pygmy witchdoctor is from some new race never seen before. Maybe we should call them $n-ians?$B$BThey must be the ones that painted all of that stuff in the cavern. I'm not sure that I like what you're describing.$B$BIt sounds to me like they're paintings of them and us on an island with an exploding volcano!</RewardText>
