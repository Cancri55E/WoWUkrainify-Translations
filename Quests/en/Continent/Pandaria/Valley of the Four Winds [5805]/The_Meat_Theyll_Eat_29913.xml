  <Title>The Meat They'll Eat</Title>
  <Description>I told you earlier, my pigs are picky eaters. They need to eat meat to grow strong, but they don't like mutton, they don't like yak, and I'm not about to feed them any pig meat.$b$bThey do, however, eat meat off of the mushan beasts, and they're also quite partial to turtle. Both creatures can be found in abundance to the west.$b$bMy skills as a hunter are admittedly quite weak. Can you help out a young rancher and his pigs?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 4 Mushan Shoulder Steaks and 80 Turtle Meat Scraps.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It hurts my ears to hear their hungry squeals.$b$bOnce you've been a pig rancher for a while, you can distinguish hungry squeals from regular squeals.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Liang sorts through the meat.&gt;$b$bYou're not just a $c, but you're a butcher, too? You've got an eye for quality pig food, neighbor.$b$b&lt;Liang throws the meat into the muddy pit below.&gt;</RewardText>
