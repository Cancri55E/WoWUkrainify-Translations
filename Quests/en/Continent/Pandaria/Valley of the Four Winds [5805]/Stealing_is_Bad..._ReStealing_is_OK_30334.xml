  <Title>Stealing is Bad... Re-Stealing is OK</Title>
  <Description>The hozen, up in the mountains to the west, continue to steal vegetables from my fellow farmers. Being so close to Halfhill, I very rarely suffer hozen attacks, but my friends have not been so lucky.$b$bSeems to me like they steal way more than they can eat. If you can find any intact vegetables up there in those mountains... steal them back!</Description>
