  <Title>The Fanciest Water</Title>
  <Description>I've heard lots of cockamamie rumors about this here brewery. I thought they were all false... until I saw that giant hozen.$b$bSo, it got me thinkin', what if the other rumors are true? I heard this one rumor just the other day about some water sprites that run around inside the brewery, causin' a ruckus and whatnot. Their bodies are actually MADE OF WATER.$b$bI reckon a man could make some mighty fine beer with some fancy water like that. If you find any, could you bring me some?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain 3 Spritewater Essences.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>This is gonna be great. It'll be just like makin' beer, but instead of water, I'm gonna use water sprite meat.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Looks like plain ol' water to me. It's hard to believe it's actually the corpse of a real, honest-to-goodness walkin'-around living thing.$b$bCan't wait to turn it into beer and drink it.</RewardText>
