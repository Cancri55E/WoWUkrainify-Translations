  <Title>A Gift For Jogu</Title>
  <Description>Sometimes I feel sad for Jogu. He's the only jinyu around, and I don't think he has any friends. Other than his smelly bottle, of course.$b$bYou know what? I've got an idea. Farmer Yoon has a basket of craneberries inside his house, and a few apples as well. I'm sure you could bring them to the stillmaster in the Halfhill Market and get him to brew something special for Jogu.</Description>
