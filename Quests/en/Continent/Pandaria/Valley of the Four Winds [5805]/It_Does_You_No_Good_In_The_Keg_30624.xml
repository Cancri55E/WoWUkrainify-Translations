  <Title>It Does You No Good In The Keg</Title>
  <Description>I been thinkin'.$b$bWe got all this beer that Chen brewed, and we got all these people that you've gathered. We should bring the two together.$b$bThere's a bunch o' folks out there in the fields, riskin' their lives for Pandaria. You an' I should at least bring 'em a keg or two.$b$bThey might raise their mugs in victory. They might enjoy one last drink before gettin' skivvered by a mantid. Either way, I wouldn't want 'em to fight without a good brew in their belly.</Description>
