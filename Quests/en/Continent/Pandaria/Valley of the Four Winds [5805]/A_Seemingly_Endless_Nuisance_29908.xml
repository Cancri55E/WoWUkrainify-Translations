  <Title>A Seemingly Endless Nuisance</Title>
  <Description>I apologize for the state of things around here. The virmen - those rabbity creatures, down the hill - have been pushing further and further into my family's farm, and our crops - which are normally bigger, and more delicious, by the way - have been suffering because of it.$b$bI'm no soldier... but you might be! Would you mind pushing some of these virmen off of our land?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 8 Snagtooth Spotters, Tool-Grabbers, or Troublemakers. Then slay 18 Snagtooth Pesterlings.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Pang surveys the area around his farm.&gt;$b$bWell, they're not ALL gone yet, but there's less of them. And they aren't holding their ears quite as high anymore.$b$bI'd guess that they're scared of you, $n.</RewardText>
