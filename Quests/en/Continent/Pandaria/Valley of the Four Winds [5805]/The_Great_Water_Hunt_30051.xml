  <Title>The Great Water Hunt</Title>
  <Description>Look at it, $n: the Gilded Fan. I heared lots of good things about the water they got here. Lots of bad things, too.$b$bNo sayin' what kind of water Chen's gonna be needin', so what say we make him a little sampler platter?$b$bCome on, let's get movin'. We'll go scoop up some water together.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Guide Mudmug to Swirling Pools within the Gilded Fan, and help him collect 30 pawfuls of Gladewater.$b$bIf you become separated from Mudmug, you can find him next to the giant banana in the Gilded Fan.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>That Stormstout feller says that he's the best brewer that ever was. Might be true, couldn't tell ya one way or the 'nother as of yet.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Lookee that, neighbor! That is quite the collection of water we got here. With magical water like this, I'm sure that Chen'll make a brew that really shines.$b$bOr possibly a brew that lands someone in the outhouse for a month. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.</RewardText>
