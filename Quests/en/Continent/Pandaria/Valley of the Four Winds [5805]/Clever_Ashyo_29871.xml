  <Title>Clever Ashyo</Title>
  <Description>I'm not sure where Clever Ashyo got his "Clever" title from. All jinyu are clever, and I wouldn't say that he's any more clever than most of them.$b$bQuite the opposite, actually.$b$bAt least he's a capable fighter. He did well enough at Tian Monastery to be selected for our training mission.$b$bIf you want to help him look for the Hidden Master, you can find him along the Valley's northern border.</Description>
