  <Title>The Lesser of Two Evils</Title>
  <Description>Like any farming community, we have the occasional virmen troubles.$b$bThe most powerful Springtail virmen live high up in the cliffs to the north, and only come down when they run out of veggies to nibble on.$b$bFrankly, I've dealt with virmen before. They're nothing but a pest that must be kept in check, and there's no better way to do that than by killing their warren-mother. Easy as that.</Description>
