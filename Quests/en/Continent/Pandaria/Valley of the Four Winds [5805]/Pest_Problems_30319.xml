I understand he's had some problems with pests.$b$bHe's got plenty of pesticide to spray the bugs that eat my crops, but I'm afraid he has no way to deal with the marmots.$b$bWould you lend him a hand? With rampant hozen and virmen attacks, I can't afford to lose crops to simple pests.</Description>
