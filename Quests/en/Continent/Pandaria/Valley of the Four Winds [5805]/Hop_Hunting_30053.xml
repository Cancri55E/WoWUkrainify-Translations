  <Title>Hop Hunting</Title>
  <Description>With Li Li fetching grain, and Mudmug handling our water, all we need is hops, and some good wood barrels. I'll handle the barrels... but I need you to gather the hops.$b$bI don't know much about the hops from this land, but I'm sure the nearby farmers have something worth brewing with. Go see what you can rustle up.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ask Gardener Fran, Gai Lan, and Den Mudclaw for hops.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>After talking with the farmers, it seems like they all will be willing to part with some hops... provided that you help them out some way in return.</RewardText>
