  <Title>Taste Test</Title>
  <Description>As long as you're here, you might as well help me out. I'm feeling pretty darn unqualified for the task, seeing as I've never drank a drop of beer in my life.$b$bYou should try a little sample of each of their grains. Let's see if any of this stuff is sweet enough for Uncle Chen.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Taste the Aged Grain, Light Grain, Fresh Grain, and Malted Grain. </LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>None of this seems to taste sweet enough! What's the deal?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Huh. I guess none of that grain is going to work. Uncle Chen is pretty picky.$b$bMaybe the Grainlord knows where we can find something more... special.</RewardText>
