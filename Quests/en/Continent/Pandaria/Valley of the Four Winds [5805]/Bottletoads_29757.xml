  <Title>Bottletoads</Title>
  <Description>Have you heard about the crisis we're having at the pools?$B$BToads have moved in and are spawning like crazy! It's become a real problem for the lotus farmers.$B$BCoincidentally, I make a jam out of gelatinous toadspawn. I call it "Bottletoads" and it's a big hit with the kids around here. Can't keep any in stock.$B$BIf you're heading to the pools, you'd be doing everyone a favor by uh... liberating some of those toad eggs.$B$BInto this bottle. For me.$B$BJust look for bubbles and scoop right in!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Scoop toad eggs from 8 Gurgling Toadspawn on the top level of the Pools of Purity.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>"It just ain't a party without Bottletoads!"$B$BHmm... no, that doesn't work.$B$B"Bottletoads: not as gross as they sound!"</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Now when the kids ask: "Do you have Bottletoads?" I can say YES!</RewardText>
