  <Title>Li Li's Day Off</Title>
  <Description>Uncle Chen asked me not to get into any fights while he was away... but that doesn't mean I can't go exploring. Finally, a chance to look around Pandaria without stopping every forty-seven steps for another rest!$b$bYou want to come with me? I'll bet there's all kinds of cool places we can visit, not too far away from here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Li Li to the Silken Fields, New Cifera, and Huangtze Falls.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That was great! You and I should go exploring again sometime.$b$bAnd it looks like we finished before Uncle Chen got back, too. Perfect.</RewardText>
