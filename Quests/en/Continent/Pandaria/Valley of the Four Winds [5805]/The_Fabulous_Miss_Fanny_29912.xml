  <Description>Most of these vegetables will be sold, but I'd like to keep some for my family. Specifically, my nephew Liang needs some to feed to his pigs.$b$bUnfortunately, the pathway to Liang's farm is currently swarming with Snagtooth virmen. We're going to have to ask Miss Fanny to help us out.$b$bBring some of the food we've gathered to Miss Fanny, who stands next to my house. Then ask her - NICELY! - to send them down to Liang's ranch.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Ang's Giant Pink Turnip, Ang's Summer Watermelon, and Pang's Extra-Spicy Tofu to Miss Fanny, and ask her to deliver them. The food must land on Thunderfoot Ranch.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I understand you're the one who sent the food down from uncle's farm. Thank you.$b$bMy pigs are picky eaters, but those turnips and watermelons are some of their favorites.</RewardText>
