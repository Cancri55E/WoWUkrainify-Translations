  <Title>The Mantidote</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Mei motions towards the battlefield.&gt;$b$bYou see those huge mantid commanders out there? They have a strange aura about them. It reminds me of the sadness we saw at Zhu's Watch.$b$bPerhaps... they're under the influence of the sha, too?$b$bI kept Ken-Ken's mask - the one he used to remove the sha from Yi-Mo. I believe that, if we use it on the mantid, we can convince them to turn back.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Ken-Ken's Mask on 5 Ik'thik Wing Commanders, then defeat the Manifestations of Fear that come out.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It looks like the mantid are definitely under the sway of the sha... the sha of fear.$b$bPerhaps they're not attacking after all - perhaps they are running away from something. What could possibly be on the other side of that wall?</RewardText>
