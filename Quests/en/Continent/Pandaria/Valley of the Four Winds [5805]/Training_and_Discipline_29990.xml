  <Description>I told myself that, if I ever made it here to the Hidden Master, I would learn everything I could from him. This is my chance, $n.

  <LogDescription>Report to Loon Mai at Stoneplow in the Valley of the Four Winds.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'm glad to hear that Lin is well.$b$bOur defenses are holding, for now. The mantid continue to send their scouts over the wall, but they haven't gotten much farther than that.</RewardText>
