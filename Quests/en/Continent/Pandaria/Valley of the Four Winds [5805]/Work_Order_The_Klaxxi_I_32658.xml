  <Title>Work Order: The Klaxxi I</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Though Yoon's writing leaves something to be desired, it's nice to still have a little piece of him on the farm.&gt;$b$bAn order came in this morning from the Klaxxi. Strangely enough they are requesting mogu pumpkins for some kind of research.$b$bI find it's best not to ask them too many questions...$b$bBest get started on their order. I'd hate to see what a bug of that size could do to your crops if you don't!</Description>
