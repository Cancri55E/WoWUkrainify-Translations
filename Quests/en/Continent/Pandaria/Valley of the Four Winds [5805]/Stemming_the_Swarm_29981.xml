  <Description>I'm not from here. I've never even BEEN here before today. But even I can tell you that something's wrong.$b$bThat wall over there was built to keep mantid off of pandaren lands.  Now, the mantid are sending their winged scouts over the top, as if the wall wasn't even there!$b$bThe only reason those spindly scouts aren't dying is because they're attacking farmers, not soldiers. They wouldn't stand a chance against someone like you.</Description>
