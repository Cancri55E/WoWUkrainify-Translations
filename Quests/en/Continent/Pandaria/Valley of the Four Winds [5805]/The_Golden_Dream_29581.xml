  <Title>The Golden Dream</Title>
  <Description>Ashyo must have experienced what we call the golden dream.$B$BMany of us working here have seen it, too - often after a long day of toiling in the pools. It is said this vision--and the feeling of elation it brings--is a reward to the mind for working the body.$B$BThere IS an easier way, though we rarely resort to it anymore: a tea can be brewed using lotus root and dreamleaf, which grows around the shrine on the upper tier.$B$BBring the dreamleaf to Yan back in town and he can brew the tea for you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring a Sprig of Dreamleaf to Yan in New Cifera.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Yes, did you need something?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah... dreamleaf! So you want to see the Golden Dream, do you?$B$BCome to think of it, I haven't seen the Dream in years - not since I was a cub spending long hours playing in the pools. Long before I took up the culinary arts.$B$BLooks like you brought enough dreamleaf for two cups of tea... so why not?$B$BHere's to better days!</RewardText>
