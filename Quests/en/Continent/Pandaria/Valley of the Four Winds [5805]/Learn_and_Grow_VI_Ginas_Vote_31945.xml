  <Title>Learn and Grow VI: Gina's Vote</Title>
  <Description>My business is doomed! You see all of the Ironpaws at their cooking stations?$B$BTheir tasty dishes draw many of the customers to this market, but they're all out of scallions!$B$BIt may not look like much, but the scallion is an essential cooking ingredient. Without it, foods are less savory, less flavorful, and less aromatic.$B$BThis is terrible. I'm not getting another scallion shipment for a week!$B$BWait a second. You're a farmer, aren't you? You think you could help me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Plant and harvest 1 Scallion, then deliver 5 Scallions to Gina Mudclaw.$B$BScallion Seeds can be purchased from Merchant Greenfield at Halfhill Market. After tilling and tending your plant, you must wait until the next day to harvest ripe Scallions.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Don't overlook the scallion. It may be small and innocuous, but it creates truly marvelous flavors.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, I'll be! I've certainly seen larger scallions, but this will do quite nicely. You've just saved our hides, $n!</RewardText>
