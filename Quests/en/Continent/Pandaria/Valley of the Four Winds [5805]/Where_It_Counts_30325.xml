  <Title>Where It Counts</Title>
  <Description>I've been watching those Kunzen hozen, and I've noticed a consistent pattern. Whenever they're getting ready to attack, they participate in strange, barbaric rituals around their totem.$b$bIf we can disrupt this ritual, not only will we put off any impending attacks, we can deal a huge blow to their morale! So get in there, rough them up, and make as much of a mess as possible!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Throw 8 Kunzen Ritual Candles, kick 4 Blazing Embers, and slay 1 Kunzen Ritualist.</LogDescription>
