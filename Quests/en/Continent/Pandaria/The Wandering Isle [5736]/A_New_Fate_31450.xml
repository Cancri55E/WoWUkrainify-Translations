  <Title>A New Fate</Title>
  <Description>These new allies have shed light on a great and important truth: it is not just Shen-zin Su that is ailing, but all of the land beyond the clouds. The world needs healing, and I think that you should be the ones to heal it.$B$BI would like you, Ji, and Aysa to leave and bring your strength and wisdom to the world. These Alliance and Horde have different ideals, but at the core of both lies noble intent.$B$BI will leave the choice of who you wish to accompany to you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to the Spirit of Master Shang Xi, and choose whether you leave with the Alliance or the Horde.</LogDescription>
