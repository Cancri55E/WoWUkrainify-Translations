  <Title>Wugou, the Spirit of Earth</Title>
  <Description>$n! Well, the plus side is that finding Wugou was easy enough. Waking him... not so much. I think he's going to wake quite sore from all the pushing and hitting I've done trying to rouse him.$B$BAre you a deep sleeper at all, $n? What wakes you up in the morning?$B$BRolling out of bed always seems to do it for me, so I figure let's just go for that! I tied off some ropes to the ox cart. We send it running and give him a good roll, and we should be good! Care to give the ox a good slap to get it going?</Description>
