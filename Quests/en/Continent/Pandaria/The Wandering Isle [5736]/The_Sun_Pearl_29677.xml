  <Title>The Sun Pearl</Title>
  <Description>Shu, the spirit of water, is eternally young, as are all the spirits of Shen-zin Su. I have been friends with Shu all of my life, but I no longer have it within me to play with him. I am old, and lack the energy.$B$BFor all his complexities, Shu is simple to please: he desires friendship. When I returned to play with Shu each season, I would always bring a Sun Pearl as a gift, and then we would play together. You can find a Sun Pearl in the pools to the southeast. Perhaps you can be his new friend.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve the Sun Pearl.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The decision to not return to the pools was a hard one. I don't think Shu ever truly understood. He does not know what it is to get older and weaker.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Shu's desires are not so different from our own. He does not want to be alone. Unwanted, unloved. He longs to be needed, and to share his life with others.$B$BKnowing that, earning his trust is not terribly difficult. He just wants company.</RewardText>
