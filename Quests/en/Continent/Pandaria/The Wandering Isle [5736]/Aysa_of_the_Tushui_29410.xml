The training grounds are behind you, but now you must prove yourself by facing a far greater challenge, one that none of my students have accomplished.$B$BI want you to return Huo, the spirit of fire, to the Temple of Five Dawns.$B$BMy two other most gifted students will help you in this task. The first is Aysa Cloudsinger. Seek her out at the pool to the west.</Description>

  <RewardText>You came for Aysa? You... you really shouldn't interrupt her until she finishes her exercises. She doesn't speak to anyone until her routine is done.$B$BIn the meantime, could you maybe help me? I had some bad luck with forest sprites.</RewardText>
