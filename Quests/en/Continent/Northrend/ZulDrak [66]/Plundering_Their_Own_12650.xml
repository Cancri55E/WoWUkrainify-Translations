  <Title>Plundering Their Own</Title>
  <Description>There is another altar nearby where there are artifacts to be saved.$B$BIt is said that the Drakkari at the Altar of Rhunok to the northwest, beyond the broken tundra of Drak'Mabwa, have already plundered their own holy site.$B$B$C, I would be appreciative if you could rescue those artifacts from their undeserving hands.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Chronicler To'kini at Zim'Torga wants you to recover 7 Rhunokian Artifacts.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>There is no comprehending the Drakkari. They are brutal savages who have sunk to a new low.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Let me look at those.$B$B&lt;The chronicler examines the artifacts that you have recovered.&gt;$B$BHmph, I'd say that we're lucky you liberated these when you did, $c.$B$BHow very interesting. This artifact here depicts the events of the Sundering. There was a time when Northrend was the far northern portion of Kalimdor.$B$BBut after the Sundering, the land broke off, eventually becoming Northrend.$B$BThis, of course, is why we see Drakkari in the southern continents as well as here.</RewardText>
