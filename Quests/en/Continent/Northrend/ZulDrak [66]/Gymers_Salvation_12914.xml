  <Title>Gymer's Salvation</Title>
  <Description>Now you say that he's locked up in a 100 foot tall cage, eh?$B$BIf my calculations are correct, we should be able to at least weaken the hinges on the cage, giving the giant enough leeway to break out.$B$BIf this is going to work I'm going to need some plasticizers and stabilizers.$B$BBanshee essence should do nicely for the plasticizer. You can get that from the banshees in the Dead Fields, northeast of us. The stabilizer can be found on the earthragers to the southwest, near Ebon Watch.$B$BGet a move on!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Engineer Reed at Crusader Forward Camp in Zul'Drak wants you to bring him 6 Banshee Essence and 6 Diatomaceous Earth.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Without the plasticizers and stabilizers I'll never be able to make the explosives necessary to break your friend out of jail.</CompletionText>
