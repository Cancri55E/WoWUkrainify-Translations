  <Title>Hexed Caches</Title>
  <Description>Pardon me, $n. I'm given to understand that you might be heading northeast up to the Zol'Maz Stronghold. Such a trip presents a great opportunity for us to conclude our Drakkari goods gathering.$B$BAs I have come to know, the Drakkari warlord is extremely paranoid. He's had all of his caches at the stronghold hexed with dire magic. Rumor has it that his tiki warriors carry the cure, but who can say?$B$BIf you could find the time to acquire some of those goods, I would be most appreciative.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Chronicler To'kini at Zim'Torga has asked you to acquire 12 Zol'Maz Stronghold Caches.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Perhaps you carry the caches within your pack even as we speak?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Just look at all of that!$B$BSee here, $n. This piece you recovered vividly illustrates that the Drakkari became aware of the weakening of the land that the Scourge caused by their presence.$B$BThe warlord felt compelled to take the opportunity this presented. He pushed the prophets to kill their gods in an effort to control the power and fight back against the Lich King's forces.$B$BEither way they were doomed. They inadvertently chose to be the instrument of their own destruction!</RewardText>
