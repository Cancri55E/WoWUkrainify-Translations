  <Title>Troll Patrol: Something for the Pain</Title>
  <Description>Gritty as my men are, they're still mortal.$b$bWounds and pain diminish their ability to perform their missions. No amount of training changes that simple fact of life.$b$bThankfully, one of our alchemists has developed a recipe for a salve that binds to our bandages and greatly reduces the pain our soldiers experience.$b$bThe salve requires a special poppy these trolls cultivate just west of here. Go to Drak'Sotra Fields and harvest some of them to keep our stockpiles from running out.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Captain Brandon at Drak'Sotra wants you to collect 5 Mature Water-Poppies from Drak'Sotra Fields.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you collected the water-poppies, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Fine specimens, $n.$b$bOn behalf of my soldiers, I thank you for your efforts today.$b$bCaptain Rupert is likely the next stop on your patrol. He's stationed at the wall just east of here.</RewardText>
