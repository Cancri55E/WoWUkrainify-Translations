  <Title>Crusader Forward Camp</Title>
  <Description>Crusader Dargath, Crusader MacKellar, Engineer Reed and the twins, Gerk and Burr, were sent to the Dead Fields to establish a battle front days ago. As of my last correspondence with them, they had successfully established a camp on the border of the Dead Fields, northwest of here.$B$BIn light of this newfound information about Drakuru and Prince Navarius I think it would be prudent to send someone to the Crusader Forward Camp post-haste.$B$BPack up your belongings, $n. You must leave at once!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Seek out Crusader MacKellar at the Crusader Forward Camp in Zul'Drak.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Everything was fine until the Scourge attacked. They took off with Dargath, Gerk and Burr and they also destroyed our ride. Guess who led that attack?$B$B&lt;MacKellar nods.&gt;$B$BNavarius...$B$BSeems this whole area is some type of factory for Scourge. We're in the middle of a damned undead mine field!</RewardText>
