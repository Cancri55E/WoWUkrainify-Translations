  <Title>Crashed Sprayer</Title>
  <Description>I know that one of those plague sprayers crashed somewhere within Drak'Sotra to the west of us.$B$BWhy don't you see if you can find it. I can use the parts from the sprayer to create the device that's going to bring those things down!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Specialist Cogwheel at Drak'Sotra has asked you to collect Plague Sprayer Parts.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the parts? Huh? Do you?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The specialist steps back a bit when presented with the parts.&gt;$B$BEw, those things are totally gross!$B$BOkay, okay, hand them over and I'll see what I can do. I probably should have had you take them to a priest first for purification.</RewardText>
