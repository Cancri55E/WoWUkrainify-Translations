  <Title>Gluttonous Lurkers</Title>

Heb'Valok is on the west side of the road leading north before the Altar of Sseratus.$B$BThere are basilisks to the east at Drak'Agal.$B$BIf you grab the Zul'Drak rats and throw them at the basilisk, they will become gorged and docile after eating five. Then you'll be able to take their crystals.$B$BKilling the basilisk won't do you any good. That'd just break its crystals!</Description>
