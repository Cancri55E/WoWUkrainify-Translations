  <Title>A Tangled Skein</Title>
  <Description>There! One tangled skein thrower ready and waiting for you to take those plague sprayers down.$B$BYou just aim and let loose. The webbing should foul up their hover spells long enough to cause them to crash to the ground just like Kolramas.$B$BKind of poetic. I like that!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Specialist Cogwheel at Drak'Sotra has asked you to use the Tangled Skein Thrower in order to cause the destruction of 5 Plague Sprayers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You sure you brought down enough of those things? Do I look like I want the plague?!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Yay! You're the best, $n!$B$BI wasn't looking forward to being sprayed with Scourge stuff, that's for sure! I guess it's going to be hard for those stupid nerubians to spread their evil now!$B$BHow about I give you a little something for saving my skin?</RewardText>
