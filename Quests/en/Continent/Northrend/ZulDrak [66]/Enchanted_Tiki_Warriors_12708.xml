  <Title>Enchanted Tiki Warriors</Title>
  <Description>I know that you're headed up to the Zol'Maz Stronghold to the northeast, $c. While you're there, I need you to deal with the warlord's special guardians.$B$BThe enchanted tiki warriors, as they're called, represent a very real threat. If the Drakkari were to mass produce them, we'd quickly be overrun.$B$BLet's you and I demonstrate that they're not worth the effort to create, shall we?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Element-Tamer Dagoda at Zim'Torga has asked you to destroy 12 Enchanted Tiki Warriors.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Surely you couldn't have dealt with all of the enchanted tiki warriors so quickly?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That should make them think twice about making more of those things. I shudder to think what it would be like to have to fight an army of those things.$B$B&lt;The element-tamer is thoughtful for a moment.&gt;$B$BI guess it would be just like fighting the endless waves of the Scourge.</RewardText>
