Our men will fight to the end and never complain no matter what the conditions.$b$bThat said, we've taken some heavy casualties in this campaign and we've been hitting it hard with little or no sleep for months. That all takes a toll on morale, whether we admit it or not.$b$bIt may not seem like much, but seeing our standard raised over the battlefield is of considerable comfort to a soldier. Take these banners and raise them at the pedestals in Drak'Sotra.</Description>
