  <Title>Kickin' Nass and Takin' Manes</Title>
  <Description>Before you meet Nass, there's something you should know.$b$bHe got a toxic dose of blight back in the day, and now he's deaf, blind, and mostly numb.$b$bIt's not all bad, though. He's virtually immune to the stuff now, which makes him perfect for certain tasks - like the one I'm about to give you.$b$bThere are many freshly scourged trolls nearby and we need to study the blight's effect on them. Take Nass, and this boot. When you've slain a troll, give him a good kick and he'll know to take a hair sample.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Stefan in Ebon Watch wants you to use Nass to collect 10 hair samples from Withered Trolls.$b$bIf you lose Nass, return to Stefan to recover him.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How's that boot holding up, $r?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You know, you remind me an awful lot of my Nass.$b$bMaybe it's just the nose...</RewardText>
