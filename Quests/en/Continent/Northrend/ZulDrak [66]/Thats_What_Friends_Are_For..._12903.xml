  <Title>That's What Friends Are For...</Title>
  <Description>We were attacked by Prince Navarius and at least a dozen Scourge. I told Dargath and the twins to stay inside the tank, but they wouldn't listen. Dargath looked me in the eyes and said, "If somebody doesn't get out of this tank, they'll kill us all." He then made Reed cut the engine and charged. Most heroic thing I've ever seen.$B$BI heard the Prince barking orders to the monsters. Sounded like he was taking them to Thrym's End, northwest of here. We have to rescue our friends. Will you go look for them?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Crusader MacKellar at Crusader Forward Camp has asked that you find Crusader Dargath, Gerk and Burr.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>There's nothing more I'd want than to help you find Dargath and the twins, but I gotta stay here and guard Reed.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It was a great sacrifice that those three made and it won't soon be forgotten. Their passing will not be in vain. We will be victorious!</RewardText>
