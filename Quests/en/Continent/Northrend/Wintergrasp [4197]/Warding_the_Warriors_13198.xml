  <Description>$n, good to see you. We must prepare for our next assault on the fortress.

The Horde has been collecting armor in the area.$B$BHead to the Glacial Falls and slay any of the Horde you find there. Return their imbued armor to me.$B$BIf you cannot find any of the Horde, you might find the armor of an adventurer slain by the elementals.</Description>
