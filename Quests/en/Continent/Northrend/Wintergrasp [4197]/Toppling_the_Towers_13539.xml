Our Warlocks report that the towers are draining power we could use to bolster our own troops.$B$BReturn to me once you've destroyed a tower.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy Shadowsight Tower, Flamewatch Tower, or Winter's Edge Tower and return to Tactical Officer Kilrath in Wintergrasp.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>My disgust for Warlocks is only exceeded by my hate for the undead. However, they can both prove useful at times.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards. I hope that these are sufficient for your service to the Horde.</RewardText>
