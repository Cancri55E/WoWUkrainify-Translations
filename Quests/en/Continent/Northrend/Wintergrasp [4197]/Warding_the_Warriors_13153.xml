  <Title>Warding the Warriors</Title>
  <Description>$n, good to see you. While the battle has subsided for now, we must hurry and replenish our stocks. My research indicates that the armor of soldiers recently slain in the Glacial Falls becomes imbued with an incredible amount of energy. The Horde has been seen collecting armor in the area.$B$BHead to the Glacial Falls and slay any of the Horde you find there. Return their imbued armor to me.$B$BIf you cannot find any of the Horde, you might find the armor of an adventurer slain by the elementals.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Sorceress Kaylana at Wintergrasp Fortress wants you to retrieve 10 sets of Imbued Horde Armor from Horde players at the Glacial Falls.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>So, did you find the armor?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Augh. It's still dripping. Couldn't you have at least dried it off first?</RewardText>
