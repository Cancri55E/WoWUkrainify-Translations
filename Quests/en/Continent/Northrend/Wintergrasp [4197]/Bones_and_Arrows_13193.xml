Well, no use complaining. $n, I am in need of dragon bone for our arrowheads.$B$BTravel to the Forest of Shadows on the western side of Wintergrasp. Ever since the last skirmish, the Alliance have been scavenging dragon bones in the area. Slay them and take the bones.$B$BIf that fails, you might be lucky and get one from the spirits in the area. I hear they love to impale their living victims on the bones as they die.</Description>
