I have need of the roses that grow there for salve to treat the wounded.$B$BSadly, the rose has become scarce due to the Alliance harvesting it too rapidly. Slay them on the Steppe of Life and retrieve their herb pouches from the bodies.$B$BIf that fails, perhaps a lasher or two might have one.</Description>
