Unfortunately, since the massacre at Angrathar, it has become almost impossible to get bone from Dragonblight.$B$BHowever, the Forest of Shadows on the western edge of Wintergrasp has enough bones to tide us over.$B$BHead to the Forest of Shadows and bring back any bone splinters you can find!$B$BThe Horde have been seen collecting bone splinters in the area. Slay them!</Description>
