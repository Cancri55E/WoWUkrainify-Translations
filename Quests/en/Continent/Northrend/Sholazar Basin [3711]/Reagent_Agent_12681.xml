  <Title>Reagent Agent</Title>
  <Description>That Archmage Pentarus, back in Dalaran, will be expecting us to return with all kinds of reagents and talismans. It seems the locals are fond of animal parts. Twisted claws from the goretalon rocs are among their favorite.$B$BIt's not my place to say whether the rumors are true or not, but I've a feeling there's something here.$B$BThe rocs live in the Bonefields off to the northeast, where they feed on the corpses of old mammoths. Will you help me gather talons for the archmage's research?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 5 Twisted Roc Claws to Colvin Norrington at Dorian's Outpost.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to find any of the twisted talons?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Colvin looks admiringly at the talons you've brought back.&gt;$B$BThese will more than suffice. The gorlocs have a saying that the more gnarled the talon, the more power it holds. I'm sure the archmage will get his money's worth from this expedition.</RewardText>
