  <Title>Dreadsaber Mastery: Stalking the Prey</Title>
  <Description>I have heard that the natives tell stories of a large dreadsaber they call Shango. I haven't seen any evidence of this Shango's existence, but my injuries have kept me from venturing outside the camp.$B$BIf you fancy yourself something of a tracker, you might be able to find out the truth about Shango. Debaar said she saw some large tracks on her last outing. Go north from the camp toward Bittertide Lake, and search its southern shore for the prints.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Buck Cantwell at the Nesingwary Base Camp wants you to identify 3 Shango Tracks from the Dreadsaber Tracks near Bittertide Lake.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How goes the tracking?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Buck listens as you recount your findings.&gt;$B$BI think you may have found the proof we need for this Shango. And I think I have an idea as to where we can find him.</RewardText>
