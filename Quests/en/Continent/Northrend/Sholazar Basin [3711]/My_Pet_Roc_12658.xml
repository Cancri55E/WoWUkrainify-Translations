  <Title>My Pet Roc</Title>
  <Description>Dorian's had me training and feeding the baby drakes he captures, and it has gotten me thinking. I want a pet of my own!$B$BNo, not a juvenile drake. I don't want a pet capable of biting my hand off!$B$BHowever, in the Bonefields to the northeast of the camp, beyond the area dominated by the drakes, there's a large population of goretalon rocs. The grown ones are beyond hope of domesticating, but if you bring me the eggs from their nests, I can raise them from the time they hatch.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 7 Roc Eggs to Zootfizzle at Dorian's Outpost.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have those eggs?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Oh, these are very nice! I've gotten so tired of robotic squirrels and chickens for company. It'll be wonderful to have a pet whose joints won't require oiling!</RewardText>
