  <Title>Lakeside Landing</Title>
  <Description>When the trouble with the Venture Company started, I asked Marvin Wobblesprocket and his wife, Tamara, to take their flying machines east to River's Heart. I asked them to setup a small camp there so that we could use them as a relay to fly in supplies and survey the area.$B$BThey should have arrived by now and started setting up. River's Heart is near the center of the basin where the rivers converge. Search for Lakeshore Landing on the northeast shore. Marvin mentioned it would be the best spot.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Tamara Wobblesprocket at Lakeside Landing.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So, Hemet sent you? We were just about to let him know that we've gotten things up and running here. Please forgive Marvin if he seems to be ignoring you, but he gets very absorbed in his work.</RewardText>
