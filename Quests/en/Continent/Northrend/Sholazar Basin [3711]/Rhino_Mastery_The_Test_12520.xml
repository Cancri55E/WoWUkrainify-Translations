  <Title>Rhino Mastery: The Test</Title>
  <Description>No rough landing is going to stop ol' Hemet from mastering the largest game Sholazar has to offer. In the wilds northwest of the camp, the jungles are ruled by the mighty shardhorn rhino. You can prove your worth to the expedition, $g lad:lass;, by showing me that you're tough enough to face down those powerful beasts.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 15 Shardhorn Rhinos and return to Hemet Nesingwary at the Nesingwary Base Camp.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you master the rhinos, or are you throwing in the towel?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, well, well, it looks like you've survived the rhinos, after all, and in pretty good shape if I do say so myself. But there's more to rhino hunting than just staring down the beast as it charges you and hoping your aim is true. No, you'll need more than that to take on the rhino patriarch that's rumored to dwell in the jungle.</RewardText>
