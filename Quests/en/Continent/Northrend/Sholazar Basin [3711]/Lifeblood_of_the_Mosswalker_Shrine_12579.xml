  <Title>Lifeblood of the Mosswalker Shrine</Title>
  <Description>I've always suspected that the pillars have been the main reason for our weather and seclusion from the undead... this confirms it a bit.$B$BNot terribly long ago, there was a sound of a great explosion when the Lifeblood Pillar fell. The weather changed for the mosswalkers almost immediately... it began to snow, something we never see.$B$BThey were able to stop the snow by bringing more lifeblood crystals to the Great Moss Stone. Perhaps if we can do the same, it will help ward off the undead as well.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Moodle wants you to collect 10 Lifeblood Shards, but stay away from the cave inside of the pillar itself.$B$BIf you lose Moodle's Stress Ball, speak to High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The Mosswalkers were good people... they did not deserve this.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>We might be too late for the shards to make a difference, but our options are somewhat limited.</RewardText>
