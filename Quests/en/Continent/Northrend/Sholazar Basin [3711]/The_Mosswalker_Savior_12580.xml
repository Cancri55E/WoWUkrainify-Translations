  <Title>The Mosswalker Savior</Title>
  <Description>There's some small chance that the Mosswalkers are not all dead yet... and at the very least, they deserve to not be butchered like this.$B$BLet's find some revenge for this slaughter and see if there are any to be saved in the process.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Moodle wants you to rescue 6 of the Mosswalker Victims in Mosswalker Village, though some of them may no longer be alive to save.$B$BIf you lose Moodle's Stress Ball, speak to High-Oracle Soo-say in Rainspeaker Canopy.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I wish I had known how key the pillars and the stones were much earlier... perhaps I could have prevented this.</CompletionText>
