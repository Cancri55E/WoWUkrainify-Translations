  <Title>The Great Hunter's Challenge</Title>
  <Description>So y'have something of a hunter's instinct. You're not a bad shot, and Hemet hasn't driven you out, so he must be planning on including you in the hunt.$B$BHow'd you like to have a bit of a competition, just me and you?$B$BHemet and the others will ask you to help in their hunting. Along the way, you and I will count up the kills we contribute to their goals. Now, this isn't something you can win in the blink of an eye, and you'll find yourself killing many different kinds of creatures. Good luck!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 60 Game Animals while you aid Hemet and his companions in their hunting. When you've killed your 60, return to Drostan at the Nesingwary Base Camp to compare numbers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Care to count 'em up?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>So, you've come to concede already?$B$B&lt;Drostan's jaw drops as you tell him you've already made all your kills.&gt;$B$BNo way! How in Azeroth did you do that? I just made my 58th. So close!$B$BBut fair's fair. I underestimated you, $n, but you've earned this victory fair and square.</RewardText>
