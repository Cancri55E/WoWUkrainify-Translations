  <Title>A Hero's Burden</Title>
  <Description>Perhaps the crystals will ward off the undead gradually, but there is one more thing that must be done.$B$BWe need to find the leader of these undead and kill him to ensure there's no one to push the wretches back upon us. If my suspicions are correct, he will be somewhere inside the fallen pillar... the Sundered Shard.$B$BThe corpses being dragged there would suggest as much anyway.$B$BI'll place the shards and bring the news to Soo-say... I'll leave the rest up to you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Artruis the Heartless.$B$BMoodle will not be able to accompany you on this task.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;The phylactery rests ominously on the ground next to Artruis's dead form.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Inside Artruis' Phylactery you see what seems like an endless void... and you think you hear screaming in the distance from somewhere inside.&gt;$B$B&lt;As you're about to leave, you see an object floating in the void, just barely in reach.&gt;</RewardText>
