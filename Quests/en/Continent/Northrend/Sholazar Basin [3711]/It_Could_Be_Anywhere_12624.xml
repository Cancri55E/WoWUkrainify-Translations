  <Description>When I found out that Miss Boulian was helping Nesingwary with his expedition, I signed up as a deckhand immediately.  You see, I'd been meaning to marry her for months!$B$BI had it all planned out.  I was going to propose the very night of the shipwreck... but now the ring is gone.  I've searched everywhere!$B$BI know it might sound crazy, but I know the engagement ring is in the Basin.  If some Venture Company didn't steal it, maybe a wild creature ate it.  But it's here somewhere... I just know it!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Look for a Golden Engagement Ring on the various creatures in Sholazar Basin.</LogDescription>
