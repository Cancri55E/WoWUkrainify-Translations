  <Title>Where in the World is Hemet Nesingwary?</Title>
  <Description>When I heard that the legendary Hemet Nesingwary was setting sail for the Sholazar Basin, I offered to help fund his expedition. We know little of Sholazar,  but it's said to be a lush paradise in the midst of this frozen continent.$B$BHemet has agreed to send back samples of exotic plants, reagents, and crystals. There hasn't been any word from him. Monte Muzzleshot was supposed to be bringing them supplies, but he hasn't returned, either. If you'll look into it, I'll send you in my flying machine.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Talk to Archmage Pentarus when you're ready to leave for Sholazar Basin. When you arrive, speak with Monte Muzzleshot in the Wildgrowth Mangal of Sholazar Basin.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Aye, Hemet's here. He's at the camp, just go northwest toward the river and you'll soon see it. And for the love of the Light, $g lad:lass;, have him send someone to cut me down!</RewardText>
