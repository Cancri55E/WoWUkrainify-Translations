  <Title>Some Make Lemonade, Some Make Liquor</Title>
  <Description>Life's tossed me a cartload of lemons this time! When the ship ran aground, the kegs carrying my best brew burst! All we have now are a few bottles of rum, and it won't sustain a thirsty expedition!$B$BWe need to get some booze cooking, and fast!!$B$BThe trees in the Wildgrowth Mangal, to the east, seem laden with fruit, but it's too high for me to reach. Look for good, strong vines, see if you can use it to shake some of that fruit out of the trees. Bring me whatever you can find.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 1 Orange, 2 Banana Bunches, and 1 Papaya to Grimbooze Thunderbrew at the Nesingwary Base Camp.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you have luck winning any of that fruit from those darn tall and stingy trees?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, that's a better assortment than I would've expected from this place. Now, for the important question: can we distill it into anything drinkable? We'd better get started.</RewardText>
