  <Title>The Taste Test</Title>
  <Description>And now for the moment of truth!$B$B&lt;Grimbooze chuckles.&gt;$B$BI've always wanted to say that. Normally, I'd debut a new drink at a banquet, but we can't have one in the middle of the jungle.$B$BInstead, just take samples to a few trusted friends and return with their comments. Let's see, we'll definitely want Hemet Nesingwary's opinion, and Hadrius Harlowe's, too. They're here in camp. You'll want to head over to Lakeside Landing, near the center of the Basin and offer Tamara Wobblesprocket a taste.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Offer a sample of Thunderbrew's Jungle Punch to Hemet Nesingwary, Hadrius Harlowe, and Tamara Wobblesprocket, then return to Grimbooze Thunderbrew at the Nesingwary Base Camp.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Don't keep me waiting, $n. What are the results?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Two out of three drinkers agree, eh? Not bad for a first try. Not bad at all. I suppose I'll have to whip up something else for Tamara by way of apology.$B$BNow... what should we call this creation?</RewardText>
