  <Title>An Embarrassing Incident</Title>
  <Description>There's one little problem we have to solve before we head out.  You see, I can't seem to find the keys to my flying machine.$B$BI've looked pretty much everywhere for them... maybe you can give me a hand.  Only place I haven't looked yet is inside the lake.$B$BI'll even give you my very own air tank.  It's almost empty, but it's got a couple of hits left.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Look for Vic's Keys inside the lake at River's Heart.</LogDescription>
