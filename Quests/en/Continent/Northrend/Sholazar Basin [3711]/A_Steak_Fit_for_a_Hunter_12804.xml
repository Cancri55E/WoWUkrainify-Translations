  <Title>A Steak Fit for a Hunter</Title>
  <Description>Sometimes, there's nothing worse than a camp full of hunters. They're all so busy taking down prey animals that the only meat I get is tough and stringy. That's hardly the kind of thing you want to come home to after a long day on the hunt.$B$BLucky for us, though, there is a source of tender, succulent meat nearby. To the south of the river and the camp live longneck grazers. They're a perfect source of meat for our hungry hunters. Bring me back the best cuts of meat and we'll properly toast our comrades.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 5 Longneck Grazer Steaks to Korg the Cleaver at the Nesingwary Base Camp.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get those steaks?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Now that's a meal! If anything good came of the shipwreck, it's got to be that we've been spared eating nothing but salt beef for the next month! Thank you again, $n.</RewardText>
