  <Title>Still At It</Title>
  <Description>Now that we've got the raw materials, I've had my assistant ready the still. He'll oversee the process, but I want you to help keep everything under control. You might be tempted to think that we just throw everything into the still and let it sit, but you're wrong.$B$BIngredients and heat need to be added at certain times, and the pressure regulated at others. You'll have no more than 10 seconds to react to a situation. Speak with "Tipsy" McManus when you're ready to start distilling.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Successfully complete the distillation process and bring the completed Thunderbrew's Jungle Punch to Grimbooze Thunderbrew at the Nesingwary Base Camp.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Well, how did it turn out?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Grimbooze gives the cask a shake.&gt;$B$BThere's something in here, but the million gold question is, can you drink it? Don't you go anywhere; you'll be responsible for overseeing the sampling of the product, too.</RewardText>
