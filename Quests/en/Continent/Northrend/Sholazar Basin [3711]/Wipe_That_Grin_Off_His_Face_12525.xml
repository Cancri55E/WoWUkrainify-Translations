  <Title>Wipe That Grin Off His Face</Title>
  <Description>We must send Foreman Swindlegrin packing if we're going to shut down his mine permanently, but be careful. His bodyguard, Meatpie, is a large, mean ogre, and  isn't likely to let you see the foreman without a fight.$B$BThe two probably occupy a platform that would let them look out over the entire Venture Company operation at Swindlegrin's Dig.$B$BRemember, the dig is on the far side of the Suntouched Pillar to the northeast. Good luck, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill Foreman Swindlegrin and Meatpie and return to Debaar at the Nesingwary Base Camp.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you dealt with Swindlegrin and his bodyguard?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>What a relief to hear that the Venture Company will trouble us no more. You have my thanks, and that of Hemet for dealing with this problem. A game hunter cannot, in good conscience, lift her weapon against another person.</RewardText>
