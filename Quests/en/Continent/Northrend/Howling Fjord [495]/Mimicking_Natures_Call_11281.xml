  <Title>Mimicking Nature's Call</Title>
  <Description>The horn has been roughed out, but before I make the traditional carvings, I want to be certain that it will work. Ahota tells me that he tests his horns at the foot of the frozen waterfall to the northeast of the post. Ahota tells me that our hunters have used the acoustics of frozen water in this way for generations. I can't wait to learn more!$B$BWill you help me test out the horn? If I've done everything right, you may even attract a yeti, so be prepared! Bring the horn back once you've tested it. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Test the Carved Horn and then return to Nokoma Snowseer at Camp Winterhoof with the results.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get a chance to test that horn?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Nokoma listens to your report from the test.&gt;$B$BI'm relieved that the horn worked so well... maybe too well if what you're saying was true. You're sure the beast spoke? I don't know if I can go on with the hunt if that's true. I'll have to speak with Chief Ashtotem about it.$B$BThis horn may end up being merely decorative, but that won't diminish its worth. Thank you for all your help, $n.</RewardText>
