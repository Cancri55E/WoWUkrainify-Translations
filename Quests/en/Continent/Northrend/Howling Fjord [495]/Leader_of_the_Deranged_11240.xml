  <Title>Leader of the Deranged</Title>
  <Description>So, I hate to say it, pal, but while you were out, the captain took a keener interest in that place.$B$BLooks like he wants my old Explorers' League boss in there dead. My guess would be that we're gearing up for an offensive to clear out the rest of them, and the captain wants their head lopped off, as it were.$B$BDo me a favor? Head back into Whisper Gulch and put an end to Squeeg Idolhunter. From what I remember, my guess would be that he's in the cave in the northwest corner.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Squeeg Idolhunter and then report back to Sapper Steelring at Westguard Keep.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;The sapper grumbles as if he wishes that you hadn't succeeded.&gt;$B$BThe captain will be pleased to hear of your success.$B$BYou know, since you've been such a good sport in dealing with this Whisper Gulch business, why don't you take your pick of one of these?</RewardText>
