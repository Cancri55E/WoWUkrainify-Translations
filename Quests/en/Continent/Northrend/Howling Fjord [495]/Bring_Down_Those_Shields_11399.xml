  <Title>Bring Down Those Shields</Title>
  <Description>Look at the button on the side of the controller here. I bet if you got close enough to one of those scourging crystals, you could use the controller to bring its shield down. Then it would simply be a matter of destroying the thing before its shield goes back up.$B$BBrave enough to hazard another trip down there, $n? I can guarantee a nice reward for you if you can bring down those shields and destroy the crystals.$B$BHow can you refuse if it means less Scourge, especially ones made from murlocs?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Apothecary Anastasia at the Apothecary Camp has asked you to destroy 3 Scourging Crystals.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You still haven't destroyed enough scourging crystals. No reward until you do so.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Anastasia turns and smiles at her succubus.&gt;$B$BVery well, $n, I concede that you have certainly earned a choice of one of these.</RewardText>
