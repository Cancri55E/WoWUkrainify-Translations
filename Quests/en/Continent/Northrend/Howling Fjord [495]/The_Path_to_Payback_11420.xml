  <Title>The Path to Payback</Title>
  <Description>Two weeks ago our chief engineer got his hands on a vrykul harpoon gun - the same type of gun that the vrykul use to take down our ships. By studying that gun he managed to put together a comprehensive operation manual.$B$BUnfortunately he was abducted and taken north of here to Wyrmskull Village. We eventually did find him, but near death and without the manual. His dying words indicated that the manual was lost in the Utgarde Catacombs, located at the northwest end of Wyrmskull. Get me that manual!</Description>

  <RewardText>&lt;Zorek flips through the manual.&gt;$B$BHrm, interesting...$B$BAccording to the manual, the vrykul have a special tool that allows them to control the harpoon guns with deadly accuracy. It looks a bit like the wheel of one of our ships. Furthermore, it's portable and seems to plug into the harpoon guns like a key. We need to get our hands on one of those!</RewardText>
