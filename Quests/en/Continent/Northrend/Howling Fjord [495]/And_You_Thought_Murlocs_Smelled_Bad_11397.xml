  <Title>And You Thought Murlocs Smelled Bad!</Title>
  <Description>I came here to investigate a rumor about a Scourge presence nearby. I expected murlocs along the coast down below, but I never thought I'd see this!$B$BThe Scourge are down there, and they're changing murlocs, and anything else they can get their hands on, into the walking dead!$B$B$C, we will not suffer them to create more of their kind, especially not from murlocs! There is a ramp down to the beach just northwest of the camp. See to it that you deal with the Scourge in a timely fashion!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Apothecary Anastasia has asked you to destroy 15 Scourge of any type along the Chillmere Coast. Return to her at the Apothecary Camp once you have done so.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>That's interesting, when last I looked it didn't appear as if you'd destroyed enough of them yet. Perhaps you might redouble your efforts?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Anastasia ponders your success for a moment.&gt;$B$BA satisfactory job to be certain, yet somehow I sense that there's something else we should be doing to stop the efforts of the Scourge on that beach.</RewardText>
