  <Title>Preying Upon the Weak</Title>
  <Description>Glad to meet you. I've come here from the Grizzly Hills to do business with your cohorts. My people maintain a large outpost there, and you'd do well to visit it when you head north.$B$BI've set up traps in the woodlands and snowy areas around here. With the meat and the furs from the creatures they capture, I'll have plenty to barter with the townspeople.$B$BI can offer you a share of my profits if you're willing to help gather prey from the traps. Beware though, you won't be the only predator out there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Trapper Jethan at Fort Wildervar wants you to bring him 8 pieces of Trapped Prey.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I hope you haven't returned empty-handed. I thought we had a deal.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Trapper Jethan inspects the creatures you've brought him.&gt;$B$BNicely done. Some of these will fetch a better price than others, but I should have plenty to trade with the locals.</RewardText>
