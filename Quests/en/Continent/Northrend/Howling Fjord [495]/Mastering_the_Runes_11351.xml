  <Title>Mastering the Runes</Title>
  <Description>I think I've figured out what the Iron Dwarves are doing. The tools they use are imbued with magic during their forging.$B$BWhen they're used to carve runes, the symbols form much more than mere words. These runes have the power to bind, compel, and twist.$B$BIf I had a set of those tools, I could mimic the runes in the book. I captured one of these boxes from one of the pavilions at Giants' Run, but it was empty. Look for similar boxes and recover a set of tools from them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring a set of Iron Rune Carving Tools to Longrunner Pembe at Camp Winterhoof.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you returned with those tools?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Pembe examines the tools.&gt;$B$BThese are more delicate than I'd thought. Allow me a moment to try them out.</RewardText>
