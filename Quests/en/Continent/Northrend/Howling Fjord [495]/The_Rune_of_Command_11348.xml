  <Title>The Rune of Command</Title>
  <Description>Can you feel the power emanating from the runes I've carved on this tablet? They're smaller versions of the runes that the Iron Dwarves are using. We'll use it to shut down their operation.$B$BTake it to Giants' Run and use it on a stone giant that the dwarves have not altered.$B$BThe giant should obey you, but I've tailored the runes to restore it to its natural state after a time. The giant may prove a valuable ally in the battle against Binder Murdis, the leader of the Iron Dwarf forces at Giants' Run.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Prospector Belvar at Fort Wildervar wants you to test the Rune of Command and defeat Binder Murdis.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you tried the rune?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You've done well in defeating Binder Murdis, but the Iron Dwarves won't give up easily.$B$BWe've made a lot of progress in understanding how they manipulate runes. Perhaps next time we encounter them, our knowledge will give us an advantage.</RewardText>
