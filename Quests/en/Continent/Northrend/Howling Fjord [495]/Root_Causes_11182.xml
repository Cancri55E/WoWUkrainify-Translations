  <Title>Root Causes</Title>
  <Description>All things in nature seek a balance. It is only through the interference of those not in tune with that harmony that the balance is shifted.$B$BYou waste your efforts when you kill the whelps and drakes. The real culprits behind the expansion of these magically burning woods are the newly awakened vrykul and their master, Skeld Drakeson.$B$BIf it's blood on your hands that you seek, start with them. You will find their lair on the south side of the Ember Clutch.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 5 Dragonflayer Handlers and Skeld Drakeson.  If you manage to do so, return to an Ember Clutch Ancient in the Ember Clutch.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How fare your efforts against the meddlesome handlers, little one?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Unfortunate that one predator must be used to put down another, but that is the natural order of things.$B$BPerhaps now the proto-drakes and their whelps can go back to living peacefully. Somehow I doubt it with the reawakening of the vrykul.</RewardText>
