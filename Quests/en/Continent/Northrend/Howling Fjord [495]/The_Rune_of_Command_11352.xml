  <Title>The Rune of Command</Title>
  <Description>Can you feel the power emanating from the runes I've carved on this tablet? They're smaller versions of the runes that the Iron Dwarves are using. We'll use it to shut down their operation.$B$BTake it to Giants' Run and use it on a stone giant that the dwarves have not altered.$B$BThe giant should obey you, but I've tailored the runes to restore it to its natural state after a time. The giant may prove a valuable ally in the battle against Binder Murdis, the leader of the Iron Dwarf forces at Giants' Run.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Longrunner Pembe at Camp Winterhoof wants you to test the Rune of Command and defeat Binder Murdis.</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>You've done well in defeating Binder Murdis, but the Iron Dwarves won't give up easily.$B$BAs my people move north, I'm certain we will encounter the Iron Dwarves again. Next time, we will be prepared to thwart them before they can dig in.</RewardText>
