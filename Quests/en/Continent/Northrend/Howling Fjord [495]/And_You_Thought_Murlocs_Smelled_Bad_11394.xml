  <Title>And You Thought Murlocs Smelled Bad!</Title>
  <Description>Originally I came down here to investigate some rumors about artifacts to be dug up. I knew that there were murlocs along the coast here, but I never in a million years thought I'd see this.$B$B&lt;The explorer pokes his head out to look around the tree.&gt;$B$BThe Scourge are out there, and they're changing murlocs, and anything else they can get their hands on, into the walking dead!$B$B$C, I think it's our duty to do something about this. Think you could take out a good chunk of those Scourge?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Explorer Jaren has asked you to kill 15 Scourge of any type along the Chillmere Coast. Return to him once you have done so.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I don't know, $c, it doesn't look like you've destroyed enough of them yet.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Jaren seems very excited about your success, but motions you to keep your conversation to a whisper.&gt;$B$BGreat job, $n! That's a lot of Scourge goo all over your stuff though. You might want to think about a quick dip in the strait. It's cold, but it'll get you cleaned up right quick.</RewardText>
