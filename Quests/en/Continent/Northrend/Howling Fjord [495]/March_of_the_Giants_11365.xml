  <Title>March of the Giants</Title>
  <Description>To the east, at Giants' Run, rune-inscribed stone giants have started to migrate north toward Frostblade Peak. I know nothing of their goals, nor of their destination.$B$BThe glowing runes inscribed in the stone flesh of the giants guide them on their journey. Fell some of these giants.$B$BTake this pick with you and use it on the corpses of the runed stone giants. It will deactivate the runes. Once you've tested enough giants, return to me with your findings.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Sage Edan and Camp Winterhoof wants you to use the Runeseeking Pick on the corpses of 4 Runed Stone Giants.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What have you found?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The sage listens to your findings.&gt;$B$BThe runes for "north" and "west" appeared over and over? I'm not an expert in these runes, but the repetition of them suggests a strong command.$B$BThese carvings are more than passive directions, though. They seem to pull the giants toward something, but what?</RewardText>
