  <Title>The Frost Wyrm and its Master</Title>
  <Description>Your instincts were right to bring this to me, but my wind riders cannot fight a dragon. You must venture west to Gjalerbron and slay the frost wyrm and its master, Wyrmcaller Vile!$B$BEven now it may be on its way!$B$BIf I'm reading these plans correctly, blowing the wyrmcaller's horn on his platform, outside in the rear left area of Gjalerbron, will call Glacion back. When the creature lands, destroy it!$B$BAnd $n, bring me the horn. We wouldn't want it falling back into the wrong hands!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Wyrmcaller Vile and use the Wyrmcaller's Horn to call down and slay Glacion. Then, return with the horn to Celea Frozenmane at Camp Winterhoof.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is the attack averted? Is the great death wyrm and its master destroyed?$B$BDid you retrieve the horn?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>This horn is as cold as the land... perhaps even colder!$B$BYou have saved Camp Winterhoof from certain doom, not that we'll be staying here much longer. What a curious $g man : woman; you are, $n. Perhaps you $r-types from over the ocean are not so bad after all.$B$BThis calls for a reward. Which do you prefer?</RewardText>
