  <Title>Field Test</Title>
  <Description>Now that we have a strain of the plague that has adapted to vrykul carriers, we really ought to test it on our specimens in Halgrind.  If all goes according to plan, they will disintegrate immediately as the plague devours their innards!$B$BYou will find Halgrind north of here.  Our plaguebringers are deploying the previous strain there - shouldn't be hard to spot.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Venture into Halgrind and use the Plague Spray on 10 Plagued Dragonflayer Vrykul.  Return to Chief Plaguebringer Harris to report the results.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you completed your field tests, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The plague didn't disintegrate our subjects?  Are you certain, $n??!$B$BThere must be an external factor we're not accounting for... perhaps the low temperatures of this climate?  Perhaps... a mutation in the strain!</RewardText>
