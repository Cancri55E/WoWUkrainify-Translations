  <Title>The Fragrance of Money</Title>
  <Description>Us pirates are known for many things, but hygiene isn't one of them.  Most pirate ships be carrying five or six times as many rats as people.$B$BIt's no wonder all the bears on this island caught the rabies soon after we moved in.  Long story short, the boss wants 'em all dead.$B$BIt just so happens I know a recipe for a bear musk fragrance popular among Stormwind nobles.  We kill the bears and sell the musk.  I see a fine business opportunity for us here.  What say ye?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Handsome Terry at Scalawag Point in Howling Fjord wants you to obtain 4 Bear Musk from the Rabid Brown Bears in the surrounding area.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Ye got the bear musk for me, matey?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent work!  It might not be quite as daring as plundering the high seas, but I'd be a darned son of a deckswabber if I passed on this opportunity.</RewardText>
