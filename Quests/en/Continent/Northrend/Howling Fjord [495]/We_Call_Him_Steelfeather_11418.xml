  <Title>We Call Him Steelfeather</Title>
  <Description>We see one brave hippogryph circling over the fort, then swooping down and taking prey. Jethan over there has taken a couple of shots at the creature, but his arrows bounced right off!$B$BWe've taken to calling this remarkable creature Steelfeather, but we can't see why he prefers the area around Fort Wildervar. Most hippogryphs are wary of people.$B$BResearcher Aderan has helped us fashion a charm from one of the creature's feathers. He claims it will allow the user to see through Steelfeather's eyes.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate Steelfeather circling Fort Wildervar and use the Feathered Charm to discover his secret. Report your findings to Gil Grisert.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did Aderan's charm work?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You saw a nest, with hatchlings? Hmm... so our "he" is actually a "she," eh?$B$BI guess that settles it. I suppose I wouldn't want to move a nest full of hatchlings just because of a new neighbor, either.$B$B&lt;Gil favors Trapper Jethan with a mock glare.&gt;$B$BI'm sure we'd get along just fine if ol' Jethan would stop trying to make a trophy of her.</RewardText>
