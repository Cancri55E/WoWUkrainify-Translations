  <Title>Adding Injury to Insult</Title>
  <Description>The vrykul are being clever about this.  Fortunately I've a trick up my sleeve.$B$BThis leader of theirs, Bjorn, is a real hothead.  We've pieced together enough of their language to fashion what we think is a good insult.  Something involving his mother and large barnyard animals... we're not quite sure.$B$BTake this piece of paper and read it to him.  Once he starts chasing you, lure him back here.  We'll make sure he doesn't make it out alive.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Read the Vrykul Insult to Bjorn Halgurdsson in Baleheim, then lead him back to Lydell's Ambush and help slay him.</LogDescription>
