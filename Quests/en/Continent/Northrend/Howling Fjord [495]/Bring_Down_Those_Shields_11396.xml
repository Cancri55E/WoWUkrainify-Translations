  <Title>Bring Down Those Shields</Title>
  <Description>Look at the button on the side of the controller here. I bet if you got close enough to one of those scourging crystals, you could use the controller to bring its shield down. Then it would simply be a matter of destroying the thing before its shield goes back up.$B$BWhat do you say, $n? You up for it? I can guarantee a nice reward for you if you can bring down those shields and destroy the crystals.$B$BIt's the least we can do to keep the Scourge from making more of their own kind.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Explorer Jaren on the Chillmere Coast has asked you to destroy 3 Scourging Crystals.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I don't know, $n. I think you need to take out a few more of those things.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Nice!$B$B&lt;Jaren looks around quickly to make sure that nothing noticed his outburst.&gt;$B$BAlright, you certainly earned your pick of one of these things I found while I was down here.$B$BAnd, $n, if you happen to find yourself back at Steel Gate, give Irena my love and let her know that I'm okay.</RewardText>
