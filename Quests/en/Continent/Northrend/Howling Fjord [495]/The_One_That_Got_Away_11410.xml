  <Title>The One That Got Away</Title>
  <Description>The barbfish you brought should work well as bait for most fish, but I fear it'll attract a monster!$B$BWhen I first arrived, I put some of Nat Pagle's favorite bait on my hook and cast it into the water. A huge monster latched on, with giant teeth and icicles hanging from its fins!$B$BWould've pulled me into those icy waters if I hadn't cut the line! I can't use the new bait until ol' Frostfin's been dealt with. Use this bait near the sunken boat in the middle of the lake. He won't be able to resist!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Christopher Sloan at Fort Wildervar wants you to defeat Frostfin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I'm itching to try out the new bait.$B$BHave you had any luck with Frostfin?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>At last, we can finally fish in peace! 'Course, by the time we catch anything, the expedition'll arrive and claim it all for themselves.$B$BYou have our thanks, $n. Don't be a stranger 'round here.</RewardText>
