  <Title>Gruesome, But Necessary</Title>
  <Description>We've had reports that these vrykul can rise from the dead; not unlike the Scourge, but a different kind of undeath.$B$BLet's not take any chances.$B$BHere, take my machete. As we move through this place, you'll need to carve up the remains of the vrykul that we take down. I'd do it, but I have a sensitive stomach.$B$B&lt;The sergeant smirks.&gt;$B$BI spent all morning sharpening it, so it should do the job.</Description>
  <LogDescription>The Westguard Sergeant has asked you to use The Sergeant's Machete to dismember 20 Vrykul of the Winterskorn tribe at Skorn.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>One thing that I know for certain is that I don't want to see any of these bigguns standing back up after we've knocked 'em down!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, $g sir : ma'am;, I have to say that you went about that particular business with a bit of zeal.$B$B&lt;The sergeant looks at you warily.&gt;$B$BAnyway, if you don't mind, I'll be taking my machete back now. It looks dull and we wouldn't want you to accidentally slip and carve me up, too.</RewardText>
