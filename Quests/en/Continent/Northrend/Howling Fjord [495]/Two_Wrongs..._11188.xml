  <Title>Two Wrongs...</Title>
  <Description>Now that we've riled up these Ember Clutch proto-drakes, they may be inclined to continue their attacks upon the keep. This will not do.$B$BI hate to compound one wrong with another, but in this case it would appear that we will have to destroy the creatures. A regrettable course of action, but one that we need to undertake regardless.$B$BTake my wand. I've been experimenting with increasing its range, but it doesn't pack much of a punch. However, what it will do is get a proto-drake's attention.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Mage-Lieutenant Malister at Westguard Keep has tasked you with the destruction of 3 Proto-Drakes.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It is unfortunate that the captain had to have you go rile up the proto-drakes. Though they seem to lack the intelligence of the dragons that we know, they still seem to be noble creatures. Not to mention the situation it places us in.$B$BDare I ask if you have dealt with the situation?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The mage-lieutenant sighs.&gt;$B$BUnfortunate business to be certain. Well, what's done is done. With any luck the new whelps that grow to be drakes at Ember Clutch will not retain a memory of our shameful actions therein.$B$BAnd with a bit more luck, the boundaries of that magical forest will not continue to spread.$B$BHere, $n, please take this pittance from the treasury for all of your troubles. It's the least that we can do.</RewardText>
