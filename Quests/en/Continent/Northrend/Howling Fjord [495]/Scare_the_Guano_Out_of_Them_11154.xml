He sent me to my doom!$B$BThe darkclaw bats hang out in the Rivenwood to the north, but I'm not taking a step off of this platform unless it's to go home!$B$BBut you... you could get it for me! Yes? Pretty please?!!!$B$BHere, take these firecrackers. My thinking is that if you drop 'em underneath the bats, the guano will be scared right out of them!</Description>
