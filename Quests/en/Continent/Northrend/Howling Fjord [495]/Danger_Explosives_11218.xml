  <Title>Danger! Explosives!</Title>
  <Description>$n, the captain's tasked me with a mission. I'd like you to help.$B$BA bunch of my fellow Explorers' League people went nuts digging up stuff in the Whisper Gulch just to the north. They're attacking anyone trying to get in!$B$BThe captain is only concerned with the ore for the keep. Lucky for us, I have just the thing to do the trick.$B$BGet in there, blow up the ore, and bring it back along with any gems you find. Running this place isn't cheap you know!$B$BI gotta warn you though, that ore is strange!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Steelring's Foolproof Dynamite to collect 6 Whisper Gulch Ore Fragments and 18 Whisper Gulch Gems. Then return them to Sapper Steelring at Westguard Keep.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Construction on this place seems to be a never-ending task. I just hope that you're able to get us what we need to continue.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The ore gave you a strange feeling? Maybe we won't use that stuff after all.$B$B&lt;Steelring looks at the stuff and takes a step back, changing the subject.&gt;$B$BThose gems look really nice! I wonder what I can get for them? Of course, there are always repairs, and new stuff to be made.$B$BYou know, I've really found working with you to be profitable. Take this... it's the least that I can do!</RewardText>
