  <Title>Spiking the Mix</Title>
  <Description>I've a feeling the long trip across the sea is affecting the effectiveness of our plague.  What is needed is a potent toxin to boost the potency of the strain.$B$BThe crabs near this beach are a distant relative of the much smaller brown-shelled tidecrawler.  The smaller tropical variety produces a paralytic toxin strong enough to knock out an ogre.$B$BAs we all know bigger is better!  The much larger glands on the local variety should prove more potent.  Bring me a few!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 3 Giant Toxin Glands from Giant Tidecrawlers to Apothecary Lysander at Vengeance Landing in Howling Fjord.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you obtained the toxin glands I seek, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You continue to prove your competence, $n.  Hopefully this toxin will be enough to boost our plague to the levels that we need to.$B$BAt the very least it should help weaken the recipient and make them more susceptible to infection.</RewardText>
