  <Title>Towers of Certain Doom</Title>
  <Description>$G Sir : Ma'am;, as we move through Skorn, we have to bring down those towers!$B$BIf you have a look at them, you'll notice that their tops are lined with casters. Getting too close to them would mean certain doom for us!$B$BHowever, we do have it within our means to call in cannon volleys from Westguard Keep. To do so, we need to get close enough so that you can lob a smoke flare atop of them.$B$BJust don't get too close!</Description>
  <LogDescription>The Westguard Sergeant has informed you that using the Sergeant's Flare to target all four of the towers at Skorn for cannon volleys would be advisable.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Getting too close to those towers is certain death as long as those casters are up there.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent targeting, $g sir : ma'am;! I'll have to remember to buy a round for the cannoneers back at the keep.</RewardText>
