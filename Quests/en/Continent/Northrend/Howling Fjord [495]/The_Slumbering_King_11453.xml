  <Title>The Slumbering King</Title>
  <Description>A sheaf of parchment drops from the still hand of the overlord. Upon it you can discern the outline of the rituals that are taking place in the catacombs below.$B$BHowever, it appears that the queen of the vrykul, Angerboda, is having difficulty awakening King Ymiron. The ritual is taking place within the large chamber, known as the Winter's Terrace, on the north end of Gjalerbron.$B$BIf you hurry, you may be able to stop her before it is too late.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat Queen Angerboda and stop the ritual to awaken King Ymiron. Should you manage to do so, return to Camp Winterhoof and report your success to Chieftain Ashtotem.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>$n, what news do you bring?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I'm not sure that I like the sound of that one bit! The Lich King absconding with Ymiron can only mean trouble. Unfortunate that you weren't able to kill him along with his queen.$B$BStill, you've put a huge dent in their plans and bought us the valuable time that we need.$B$BAnd who knows, with the way you get around, you'll likely run into King Ymiron again. I'm sure that he won't fare so well the next time you meet.</RewardText>
