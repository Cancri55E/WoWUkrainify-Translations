  <Description>Has Malthus drawn you in with his blather about beer kegs and crazy dwarves?$B$BI'm not questioning that the dwarves are crazy, but I don't think stealing their beer is going to do any good.$B$BWhat we need is brains. Lots of brains. We'll get down to the bottom of this mystery in no time, and perhaps even find a new component for the plague.$B$BTake this saw, go southeast into the Whisper Gulch, and kill yourself some dwarves. Use the saw to help you harvest the brains and bring them back here.</Description>
