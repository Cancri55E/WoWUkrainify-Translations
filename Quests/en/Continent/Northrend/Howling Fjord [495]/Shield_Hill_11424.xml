With these eggheads making all sorts of killer plagues and sending them to enemy towns, most of the material gets contaminated.$B$BThere is a place, though, where usable samples exist.  Shield Hill, south of here, is an ancient vrykul burial ground where the dead walk but are not afflicted with any plague - ours or the Lich King's.  Get me some bones, I'll pay ya well.</Description>
