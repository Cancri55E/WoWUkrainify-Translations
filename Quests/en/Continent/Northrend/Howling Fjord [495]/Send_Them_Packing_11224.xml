  <Title>Send Them Packing</Title>
  <Description>I've heard rumors of bad happenings in the Whisper Gulch to the north. Most of the Explorers' League went down into that place, and some say they went mad with what they discovered.$B$BThat doesn't change the fact that they took most of our mules and equipment with them, though. I won't lose those mules!$B$BIf you find yourself in there, and happen across any of my mules, just get up close on them and threaten them with a raised hand. They'll spook and come home for sure.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Explorer Abigail has asked you to /raise your hand at 10 Abandoned Pack Mules and then return to her at Westguard Keep.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>This is quite a blow to our efforts. I don't even want to know what they discovered down there.$B$BIt's enough to keep me awake at night just trying to imagine what it could be.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I'm indebted to you, $c. At least with most of the mules and equipment recovered, we can hope to rebuild our numbers soon.$B$BPlease, take this.</RewardText>
