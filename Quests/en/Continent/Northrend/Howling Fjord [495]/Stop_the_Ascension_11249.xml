  <Title>Stop the Ascension!</Title>
  <Description>This huge scroll is made from dragon skin. Unfurling its more-than-ten-foot length, you can see that the images painted upon its scaly surface depict a mysterious vrykul ritual.$B$BA vrykul thane, surrounded by angelic-looking beings, ascends into the heavens. A mysterious, darkened figure looms large in the picture's background.$B$BA tingling in your gut tells you that the thane of Skorn is about to do this. You must stop it! A large pyre sits at the top of Skorn in front of the thane's lodge.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Present the Vrykul Scroll of Ascension near the Thane's Pyre to call him out and slay him. Afterward, due to the nature of the ritual, you're sure that Father Levariol at Westguard Keep will be interested in seeing the scroll.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Yes? How may I help you, my child?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Yes, $g my son : my daughter;, that is ominous-looking, and you obviously had the right of it.$B$BThank you for bringing this scroll to me. I am very keen to study its implications. If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that these vrykul have a way to transcend death; at least those that are worthy.$B$BBy defeating the Winterskorn thane, you proved him unworthy. The Light only knows what he would have become, and what terror he might have rained down upon us, had you not slain him.</RewardText>
