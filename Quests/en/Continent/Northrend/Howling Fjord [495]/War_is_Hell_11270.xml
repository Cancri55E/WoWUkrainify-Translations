  <Title>War is Hell</Title>
  <Description>We're slowly finishing off the remnants of Stormwind's North Fleet stationed on this coast.  The bodies to the west are a testament to how brutal this confrontation has been.$B$BThis does not happen to bother my refined aesthetics, but it does present a danger to our lives.$B$BIn the lands of the Lich King, the dead are a weapon that can rise against us at any point in time.  Take this torch - you're going to make sure that doesn't happen.</Description>
  <LogDescription>High Executor Anselm at Vengeance Landing wants you to take the Burning Torch and use it to burn 10 of the corpses littered to the west of town.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I don't care how many giants, dragons or kobolds you've killed before.  Get this job done and come back when you're finished.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I'm glad you've proven you can follow orders.  If I had a copper piece for every arrogant fool in shiny armor to come here and think they're above the chain of command... well, I'd have a few gold.$B$BNow that you've demonstrated a measure of discipline, I have other tasks more suitable for someone of your caliber.</RewardText>
