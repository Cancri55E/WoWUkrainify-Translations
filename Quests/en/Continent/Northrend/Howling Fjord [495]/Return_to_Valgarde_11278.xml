  <Title>Return to Valgarde</Title>
  <Description>'Tis a shame we lost two of our best dwarves while uncovering these relics. They sacrificed their lives to keep this information safe.$B$B&lt;Glorenfeld wraps the cipher and tablets in a tattered cloth.&gt;$B$BTake these back to Valgarde. McSorf will know what to do with the find.$B$BAs for me? I'll be alright on my own. I've gotten this far in one piece!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Take Glorenfeld's Package to Beltrand McSorf at Valgarde Port.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You're back!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Sorting these tablets out is going to take some time. All I can gather from a precursory study is that whatever used to be here was an ancestor of the humans. Those vrykul things probably killed 'em all off. Anyhow, we'll know more once I get these relics set up.</RewardText>
