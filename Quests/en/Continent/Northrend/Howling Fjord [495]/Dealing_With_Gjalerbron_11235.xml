  <Title>Dealing With Gjalerbron</Title>
  <Description>And now we have a different problem. My scouts that have lived to return have informed me that the vrykul are up to no good at their main fortress to the north.$B$BThey call the place Gjalerbron, though you'd pronounce the 'Gj' as if it were an 'Sh'. Odd creatures.$B$BBut that's not important; what is, is that you get up there and put an end to the lives of as many of those creatures as you can while trying to figure out what they're up to.$B$BI know that I can count on you, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Captain Adams has asked you to kill 15 Gjalerbron Warriors, 8 Gjalerbron Rune-casters, and 8 Gjalerbron Sleep-watchers. Afterward, return to him at Westguard Keep.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I want those filthy creatures dead! They threaten us all over the fjord, and it's high time we put a stop to them by wiping them out at Ssssshhhhhalerbron.$B$B&lt;The captain says the name of the vrykul fortress derisively.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good work, $n, and good riddance.$B$BBut, what you say about that place troubles me still, and I think our culling is not quite at an end!</RewardText>
