  <Title>I'll Try Anything!</Title>
  <Description>I never want to see another barrel of salted fish as long as I live! Filling barrels day in and day out, and there are still more to be filled!$B$BI wish I hadn't used up all that bait I bought from Nat Pagle. Worked like magic, it did. Now I'm lucky if I can catch a fish an hour!$B$BI hear the northern barbfish make pretty good bait, but who's crazy enough to dive into a freezing cold lake and hack up the water plants in search of them? Not me... but maybe, just maybe, I can persuade you to...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Christopher Sloan at Fort Wildervar wants you to bring him 5 Northern Barbfish.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You look like you're still in one piece. Get any of that bait?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, these certainly are ugly enough, but I suppose I don't care if it actually works. I'll be relieved once the expedition has passed through and I can go back to simply fishing for my dinner.</RewardText>
