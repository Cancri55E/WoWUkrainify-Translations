  <Title>Forgotten Treasure</Title>
  <Description>I've made my fortune by specializing in treasure that regular pirates don't appreciate: art, antiquities, collector's pieces.$B$BBlack Conrad's fleet sank south of here years ago.  All the gold and jewelry was picked clean by divers, but two ancient relics remain there.  One is a museum-quality Amani vase, the other is an eagle figurine.$B$BGo and retrieve them for me and I'll vouch for you with the other pirates.  I'll even throw in something to make your underwater adventure a bit more manageable.</Description>
