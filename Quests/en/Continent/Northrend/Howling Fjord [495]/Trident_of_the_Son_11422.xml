  <Title>Trident of the Son</Title>
  <Description>&lt;From the scratches he makes in the rock, you see several symbols: a trident, a mur'ghoul, the sun, a wrecked ship, and a rough stick-figure of yourself.&gt;$B$B&lt;Puzzling out what the murloc is conveying takes a while. Obviously he wants you to get a trident from the Chillmere Coast, but the image of the sun is puzzling. That is until you realize he means his son.&gt;$B$B&lt;His son was changed into a mur'ghoul! He wants you to find him to the south near the wrecked ship and return with his trident.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Old Icefin wants you to obtain Rotgill's Trident. Return it to him on the small island on the Chillmere Coast.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>&lt;One of Old Icefin's dead fish-like eyes studies you, clearly looking for signs of his son's trident.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Reaching out to take his son's trident from you, Old Icefin's hand shakes a little. Could it be that the aged murloc is grieving?&gt;$B$B&lt;Is that just extra moisture pooling at the base of his eye?&gt;</RewardText>
