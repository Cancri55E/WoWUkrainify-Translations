  <Description>I've overheard what you've had to say with Greatmother Ankha. With all due respect, she's not having you go far enough.$B$BYou must also deal with the vrykul that lie dormant in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron!$B$BI have no doubt that the rituals involved with awakening them are the key to their downfall. Most likely the necrolords have some device that you can use to bring the vrykul out of their dormant state prematurely.$B$BSurely such a disruption will prove fatal to the vrykul.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ahota Whitefrost has tasked you with slaying 5 Dormant Vrykul. Return to him at Camp Winterhoof when you have done so.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I find it unlikely that you have dealt with enough of the dormant vrykul. Come back when you have done so.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You did what had to be done. The unwise might consider it dishonorable to slay the helpless while they awaken, but in this case you would have been a fool to have done otherwise.$B$BAnd we certainly couldn't have just left them standing there to be ritually wakened, now could we?$B$BIt was a brave thing you did for all of us down in those catacombs, $r.</RewardText>
