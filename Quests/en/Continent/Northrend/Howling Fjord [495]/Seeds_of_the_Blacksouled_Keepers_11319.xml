  <Title>Seeds of the Blacksouled Keepers</Title>
  <Description>The glade to the northwest, now the Twisted Glade, used to be home to a number of keepers of the glade. Together with the sisters, they saw to the glade's upkeep.$B$BWhen the glade changed, the sisters died, but somehow the keepers managed to survive. Now, they seed the land with poisonous spores that wither healthy greenery.$B$BI'll give you one of the cores from the ice elementals. Once you've destroyed a spore, use the ice crystal to freeze it and keep it from regenerating.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Lurielle at the Frozen Glade wants you to freeze 8 Spores.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The Twisted Glade is a terrible place. I never imagined our homes could become something so loathesome.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>The ice core worked well for you? I'll have to remember that. I'm certain the keepers will not stop just because we've destroyed their work once.</RewardText>
