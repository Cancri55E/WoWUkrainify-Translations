  <Title>Mission: Eternal Flame</Title>
  <Description>The Forsaken are up to no good and from what I can tell, those plague tanks of sludge are a big part of it.$B$BIf I may suggest, $g sir : ma'am;, we should probably destroy them before they can get any more use out of the things. I took the liberty of preparing a bundle of torches from the Ember Clutch. These things have been burning for days!$B$BHere, I'm sure you can put them to better use than I in destroying those tanks.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Scout Knowles at the Ember Spear Tower has recommended that you use the Ever-burning Torches to destroy the four Plague Tanks surrounding Halgrind.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It's hard to tell from all the way over here exactly what's happening down there. Did you manage to put those plague tanks to the torch?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Nice!$B$BBut what's this about the stuff you found inside those tanks? Are you saying that the Forsaken are spraying a plague upon the vrykul down there?</RewardText>
