  <Title>Towers of Certain Doom</Title>
  <Description>As we move through Skorn, we must destroy the towers.$B$BIf you have a look at them, you'll notice that their tops are lined with casters. Getting too close to them would mean certain doom.$B$BHowever, we can call in wind rider air strikes from Camp Winterhoof. To do so, we need to get close enough so that you can lob a smoke flare atop of them.$B$BJust don't get too close.</Description>
  <LogDescription>The Winterhoof Brave has informed you that using the Brave's Flare to target all four of the towers at Skorn for air strikes would be advisable.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Getting too close to those towers is certain death as long as those casters are up there.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You have a strong arm, $n.$B$BIt looks as if those wind riders finally made themselves useful instead of just standing around and drinking all day.</RewardText>
