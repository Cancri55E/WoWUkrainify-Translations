  <Title>Mastering the Runes</Title>
  <Description>I've got a set of picks, hammers, and chisels with me, but they won't work for carving these runes. The tools used by the Iron Dwarves are imbued with magic during their forging.$B$BWhen they're used to carve runes, the symbols form much more than mere words. These runes have the power to bind, compel, and twist.$B$BI believe I know how it works, but without a set of those tools, I can't be certain. Look for kits resembling mine near the Iron Dwarf pavilions at Giants' Run and bring them to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring a set of Iron Rune Carving Tools to Prospector Belvar at Fort Wildervar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you returned with those tools?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Belvar handles the tools carefully.&gt;$B$BI'm going to try these out. If we're to understand the Iron Dwarves' motives and defeat them, I need to know exactly what the runes are doing.</RewardText>
