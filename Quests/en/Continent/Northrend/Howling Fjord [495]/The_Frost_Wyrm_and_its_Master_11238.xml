You must venture to Gjalerbron and slay that wyrm and its master, Wyrmcaller Vile!$B$BEven now, as we speak here, the frost wyrm may be on its way.$B$BHowever, if I'm reading these plans correctly, blowing the wyrmcaller's horn on his platform, outside in the rear left area of Gjalerbron, will call Glacion back. When the creature lands, destroy it!$B$BAnd $n, please bring me the horn. We wouldn't want it falling back into the wrong hands.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay Wyrmcaller Vile and use the Wyrmcaller's Horn to call down and slay Glacion. Then, return with the horn to Mage-Lieutenant Malister at Westguard Keep.</LogDescription>
