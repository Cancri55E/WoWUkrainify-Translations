  <Title>Something That Doesn't Melt</Title>
  <Description>No no no! Those ice shards didn't work at all! They'll melt before they even do any damage. That's the last time I'll trust Narf's word on materials. This means we need something else entirely for the shrapnel.$b$bI know! I'm brilliant. Bone splinters.$b$bThere are some bones all around here that the jormungar have been gnawing on pretty thoroughly. Go check them out and see if you can find me some splintered bone that I can use.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search the dragon bones east of Nozzlerust Post for 12 Splintered Bone Chunks.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were there any splinters to be found?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent!  That should be the last thing I need to test out the new bombs.  Just a moment and I'll try this out!</RewardText>
