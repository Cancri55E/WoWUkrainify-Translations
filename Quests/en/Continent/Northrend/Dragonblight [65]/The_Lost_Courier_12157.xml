  <Title>The Lost Courier</Title>
  <Description>We're lucky we made it this far, $n.  We were ambushed by Scourge as soon as we landed.$B$BOne of our men turned out to be a spy for the Cult of the Damned.  Thassarian appears to have more evidence of cultist infiltration.  Apparently it goes all the way to the top.$B$BI've sent one of my best couriers to our outpost in western Dragonblight, but he has not yet returned. I fear he may have fallen to the Scourge. Will you go to Dragonblight and search for him? Courier Lanson is his name.

  <RewardText>As I crossed the bridge into Dragonblight a small group of Anub'ar ambushed me! I was surrounded! Those monsters knew I was coming. I barely made it out of there with my flesh intact. This list I hold must be taken to Wintergarde Keep, but I am too badly injured to make the journey.</RewardText>
