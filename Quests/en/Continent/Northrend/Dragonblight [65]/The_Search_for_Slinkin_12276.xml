  <Title>The Search for Slinkin</Title>
  <Description>While I have not heard from Slinkin or know what fate has befallen him, perhaps I can assist in finding him.$B$B&lt;Quarterflash holds up a tiny mechanical toy.&gt;$B$BThis is not a toy, newfound compatriot. It is, in fact, my latest mechanical creation. The machine was created with the sole purpose of finding that which has been lost. These are unfortunate circumstances, but the machine is your best chance at finding Slinkin.$B$BWhen you are ready to begin your search, place the bot on the ground next to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Slinkin the Demo-gnome in Wintergarde Mine. Use Quarterflash's Homing Bot if you need help finding the mine.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;There is a note in Slinkin's death grip.&gt;$B$BChased into a dead end. Hidden for now, but they know I'm here. It won't be long until they find me.$B$BThe miners work tirelessly to unearth the strange ore that fuels the Scourge war machines. There is much banter. The language of death confounds me, but I have been able to identify commonly uttered sounds and phrases. The word "Yogg-Saron" is said with great contempt and is usually followed by loud outbursts. They refer to the ore as "saronite." Meaning?</RewardText>
