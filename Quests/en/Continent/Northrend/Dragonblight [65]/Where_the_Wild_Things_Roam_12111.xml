  <Title>Where the Wild Things Roam</Title>
  <Description>Inside this pack are several vials containing the vaccine that Sintar created. I now want you to search the nearby woods for Snowfall elk and arctic grizzlies. When you locate the animals, find a safe distance and throw a vial in their general direction. The vial will shatter and release a fine gas that will act as the inoculating agent. The beasts merely have to step inside the gas and they will be vaccinated - ultimately saved.$B$BInoculate as many of the beasts as you can and return to me.
