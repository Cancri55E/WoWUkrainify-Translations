  <Title>Steamtank Surprise</Title>
  <Description>This is a seek and destroy mission. You'll be driving a tank into the Carrion Fields to dismantle Scourge plague wagons. With the tank comes a crew of three 7th Legion soldiers. All must survive if this mission is to succeed!$B$BYou'll need to get in close to a plague wagon to unleash your engineer. Let them do their deed and move on to the next one. When the field is clear of plague wagons, head to the mausoleum in front of the ruined keep and drop off the rest of your crew. Meet with Ambo Cash inside.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use an Alliance Steam Tank to destroy 6 Plague Wagons and deliver the 7th Legion Elites to Wintergarde Mausoleum. Speak with Ambo Cash inside the Wintergarde Mausoleum in Dragonblight should you succeed.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Name's Cash. Ambo Cash. And the pleasure is all yours.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Why I'm not wearing any pants isn't important. Let's just say I took some Scourge shrapnel in the wrong place and leave it at that, ok?$B$BSo you wiped out those plague wagons up in the fields and got my soldiers here in one piece. Impressive. You're one of the first to make it this far, friend. Too bad you gotta go right back out into the Carrion Fields. Yep, we've had a bit of a setback.
