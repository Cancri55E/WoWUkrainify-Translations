  <Description>We must move decisively against the wolvar if we're to have a chance of survival. However, I worry that in our zeal, too many of them will be slain.$B$BThe Snowfall Glade wolvar have as much right to exist as do we. You and I will see to it that they get that chance.$B$BIf Elder Ko'nani hasn't asked you already, he will ask you to deal with them.  While you're upon the glade to the north, I'd like you to bag up their pups and bring them back to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 12 Snowfall Glade Pups. Deliver them to Trapper Mau'i at Moa'ki Harbor.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How many pups could you have possibly saved in so short a time?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well, I guess you saved plenty of them. Thank you, $r.$B$BNow the wolvar will have a chance of surviving along with us. If we survive at all, that is.$B$BDo you think that you could return tomorrow so that we can save more of the pups?</RewardText>
