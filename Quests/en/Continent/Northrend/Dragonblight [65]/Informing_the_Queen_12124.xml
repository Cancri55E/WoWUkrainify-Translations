  <RewardText>You are very courageous to bring us this information. I was beginning to wonder why the blue dragonflight had so boldly initiated an attack upon the temple itself. Now we know that they are using enormous amounts of the very magic they view as such a threat to Azeroth.$B$B&lt;The queen shakes her head in seeming resignation.&gt;$B$BHypocritical, but so be it.
