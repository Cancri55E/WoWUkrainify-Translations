  <Title>The Focus on the Beach</Title>
  <Description>The mage hunter forces are active on the Glittering Strand to the south of Moonrest Gardens. My guess is that you'll find a heavily guarded focus on the beach and a captain who is in charge of it.$B$BNo doubt the captain will have some sort of controlling device on their person. Get the controller and use it on the focus.$B$BWith any luck, we'll be able to get some more information about what they're really up to out there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Ley Line Focus Control Ring and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus on the Glittering Strand.$B$BThen, return to the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What news do you bring from the beach, $c?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>How very odd that it imprinted this information upon you magically.$B$BSo, not only do we know that they've redirected the flow of the power coming out of the Moonrest Gardens, but we now know that the power is being purposefully changed in some way. Just what are they up to with all of that magic?$B$BI don't like where this is leading, $n, not one bit!</RewardText>
