  <Title>The Perfect Dissemblance</Title>
  <Description>You may wonder how I can maintain this guise; I use a magic mirror that was loaned to me by the spy mistress.$B$BIt only has so much power in it, but I think there's enough for the both of us. Here, take it. I want you to use it to impersonate one of the Onslaught raven priests.$B$BBe quick about it... I have no idea how long my glamour will last while you have the mirror.$B$BRealize that you won't immediately be perfectly disguised, so don't count on it being foolproof until I've had a chance to help you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Agent Skully at New Hearthglen has asked you to steal the image of an Onslaught Raven Priest. Return the Banshee's Magic Mirror to her when you have done so.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Please tell me that you didn't break the mirror?!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Not bad, $c. Now that the priest's image is trapped within the mirror, I have something else that needs doing.</RewardText>
