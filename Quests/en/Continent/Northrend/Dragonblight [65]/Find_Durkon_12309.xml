  <Title>Find Durkon!</Title>
  <Description>After the Scourge breached the south wall, I ordered Cavalier Durkon to investigate the town crypt. Moments ago I was handed his report.$B$BThe undead that plague us are coming from two sources: the ruins of Wintergarde, now a breeding ground for Scourge, and our very own town crypt! Amidst the chaos and confusion the Scourge managed to get a necrolord inside the crypt.$B$BIn his message, Durkon requested assistance. You will find him and help him, $n. The crypt is on the western border of the town square.</Description>

I barely made it out last time - which is what prompted my request to the High Commander.$B$B&lt;Durkon looks you up and down.&gt;$B$BYou got that crazy look in your eyes, $r. Thankfully, you're gonna need to be crazy to do what I'm about to ask of you.</RewardText>
