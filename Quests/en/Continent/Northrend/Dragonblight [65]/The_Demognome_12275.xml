  <Title>The Demo-gnome</Title>
  <Description>Quarterflash recently requisitioned my group for a specialist that he could send on a reconnaissance mission to the Wintergarde Mine. To that end, I sent him Slinkin, my demolitionist. I foolishly thought that he could close off that pit of damnation after his mission for Quarterflash was complete, securing another victory for us against the Scourge.$B$BAn entire day has now passed and Slinkin has not returned. I want answers! Speak with Siege Engineer Quarterflash and track down my missing agent!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Siege Engineer Quarterflash at Wintergarde Keep in Dragonblight.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I feel terrible about this, friend. I fear that in my haste to recover the strange ore from Wintergarde Mine I may have doomed agent Slinkin.
