  <Title>Emerald Dragon Tears</Title>
  <Description>With an inert specimen of the blight compound complete and the activating agent in hand there only remains a need for a suitable shell to house the components.$B$BSouthwest of here, on the shores of central Dragonblight, is where you will find the Emerald Dragonshrine. Within the shrine you will find the hardened remnants of a green dragon's tear drop. I don't know the whole story, but apparently they cry a lot right before they die. Go figure.$B$BGo to the Emerald Dragonshrine and gather tears.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Chief Plaguebringer Middleton at Venomspite in Dragonblight wants you to collect 8 Emerald Dragon Tears.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Fortunate it is that we have a location nearby holding a surplus of emerald dragon tears. I would have had to send you to Feralas otherwise.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I do believe that the blight is now ready for a field test. Fortuitously, the dread citadel, Naxxramas, is laying siege to Wintergarde Keep. From beneath the very earth that Wintergarde was built upon rise the living dead, eager to do the bidding of Kel'Thuzad.$B$BThe Alliance are, of course, outmanned and outgunned. The people laid to rest in the Wintergarde Mausoleum awaken, hungering for flesh!$B$BPerhaps we shall give them a taste of the blight, yes?</RewardText>
