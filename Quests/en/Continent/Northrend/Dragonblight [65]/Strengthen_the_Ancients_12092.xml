  <Title>Strengthen the Ancients</Title>
  <Description>It's not only the $r race that has been impacted by what the blue dragonflight forces have done. The ancients of the Lothalor Woods to the southeast have been affected as well.$B$BSome have been corrupted-- avoid them at all costs--but most can still be saved. However, the treants of the woods seem to be immune to the magic seeping through the land and the arcane wyrms that have come with it.$B$BAsk the treants for their bark and feed it to the ancients. Hopefully that will be enough to save them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Bark of the Walkers to strengthen 3 Lothalor Ancients and then return to Sarendryana at Stars' Rest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>An added benefit of saving the ancients may turn out to be that they will consider assisting the Alliance with its hardships. Regardless, it is the right thing to do.$B$BNow, how many were you able to strengthen, $c?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $r! We've lost so much already. You've ensured that we won't lose the most majestic of Northrend's children.$B$BI'll soon leave to speak with the ancients you saved and see if they will help us in our time of need.</RewardText>
