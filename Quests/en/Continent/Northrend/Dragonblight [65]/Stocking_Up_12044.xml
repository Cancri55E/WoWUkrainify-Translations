  <Title>Stocking Up</Title>
  <Description>Hello hello!  The Scourge to the south are digging up some ancient dragon thing.  I could care less why they're doing it, but they're pulling cartloads of composite ore in the process.$b$bGo lift me a bunch of that ore.  That stuff should yield a pretty penny for all the weapons the Horde are crafting.
</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather 8 bundles of Composite Ore from the digs surrounding Galakrond's Rest and bring them to Xink at Nozzlerust Post.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get the ore?  My carrier will be back shortly - we need to get this shipment out while the fight's still going!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Hah!  That's quite a load!  Your back feeling alright?</RewardText>
