  <Title>Shaved Ice</Title>
  <Description>I've never seen you before... are you new to the Vice?  Glad to have you.  I could always use some more hands.$b$bYou get the materials, I'll finish my machine, then we can sell it to those commander types and all go home rich.$b$bI actually have most of the primary components, so I just need some of the materials for the weapon itself.  Narf said that jagged ice shards from those elementals to the north would make perfect shrapnel for my bombs - go nab some, will ya?
</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 4 Ice Shard Clusters from Ice Elementals in the north and bring them to Zivlix at Nozzlerust Post.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have the shards?  I'm almost finished with the main refrigeration unit.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent!  They're even sharper than I expected them to be.  I'll pack them in the snow until the bomb is ready.$b$bLet's see... what next...
