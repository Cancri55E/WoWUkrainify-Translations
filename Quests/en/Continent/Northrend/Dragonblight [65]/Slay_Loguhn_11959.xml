  <Title>Slay Loguhn</Title>
  <Description>Already it goes from bad to worse. There is only one course to take... regrettably, Loguhn must die!$B$BHe's the alpha male of the Snowfall Glade tribe and one mean wolvar. But it's the only way to get a short break from their attacks and stealing forays.$B$BYou will find the "Render of Flesh" in front of his hovel upon the northern rise of the glade. It's larger than the others and hard to miss. Kill him and smear his blood upon yourself, both to show your dominance and respect.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Smear the Blood of Loguhn upon yourself and then return to Elder Ko'nani at Moa'ki Harbor.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is that Loguhn's blood or your own, $r?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Loguhn's honorable sacrifice at your hands is exactly what my people need. Now we will make the most of the wolvar in-fighting for his place.$B$BIt will have to be enough.</RewardText>
