  <Description>Within his robes you find two things of interest.$B$BOne is a talisman, which is clearly a focus controlling device. The other is a set of orders from someone named Sidragos, which were ultimately intended for the leader back at the Moonrest Gardens.$B$BThe water-soaked parchment informs Goramosh that he is to move all mage hunter forces east to the Azure Dragonshrine.$B$BPerhaps you should get what information you can from the focus and head east to observe the dragonshrine from its western ledge.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Ley Line Focus Control Talisman to gain information from the Ley Line Focus under Lake Indu'le. Then, head east to the Azure Dragonshrine near south central Dragonblight and observe what is occurring there from the western ledge.$B$BAfterward, return to the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What is it, $N? You look flushed.$B$BTake a moment to catch your breath.</CompletionText>
