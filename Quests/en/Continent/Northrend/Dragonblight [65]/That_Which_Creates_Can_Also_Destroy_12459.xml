  <Title>That Which Creates Can Also Destroy</Title>
  <Description>Since we only have three seeds, we must put them to the best possible use.$B$BYour targets are one of the reanimated frost wyrms circling to the north near Galakrond's Rest, Turgid the Vile in the ruined barracks at the Carrion Fields to the east, and Overseer Deathgaze at Jintha'kalar far to the northeast.$B$BWhile the seeds would outright destroy one of the lesser Scourge, they will greatly weaken these three. Enough so, in fact, that you should be able to handle them on your own.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Lord Itharius at the top of Wyrmrest Temple has asked you to destroy a Weakened Reanimated Frost Wyrm, Weakened Turgid the Vile, and Weakened Overseer Deathgaze.</LogDescription>
