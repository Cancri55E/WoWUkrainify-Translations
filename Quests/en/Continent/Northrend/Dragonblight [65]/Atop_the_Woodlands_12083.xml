  <Title>Atop the Woodlands</Title>
  <Description>I'm convinced that there must be more of those foci, each of them in-turn redirecting the ley line energies. We still don't know precisely what they're doing with all of that power, though.$B$BMy guess is that you'll find another one atop the Lothalor Woodlands to the southeast. Once again you'll need to find the person in charge and take whatever controlling device they have in their possession as I'm sure that each focus has its own.$B$BBe careful, $n, those woods are very dangerous.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Ley Line Focus Control Amulet and use it to gain information from the Ley Line Focus in the Lothalor Woodlands.$B$BThen, return to the Image of Archmage Modera at Stars' Rest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What did you find up in the woods?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>They're empowering their forces with it? That doesn't make any sense; the mage hunters aren't that powerful.$B$BThis must mean that they're only using the magic at the terminus of wherever they've redirected the ley line to.$B$BWe're going to need more information if we're to have a chance at finding and stopping them!</RewardText>
