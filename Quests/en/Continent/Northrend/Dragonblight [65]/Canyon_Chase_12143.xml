  <Title>Canyon Chase</Title>
  <Description>I can't believe this! Another band of those vermin just tried to take off with more of our supplies. They're scurrying off towards that north canyon, get after them and deal with whoever they're going to!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Duane wants you to chase the snobolds down the canyon northeast of 7th Legion Front and deal with their leader.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is it done?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Chilltusk, eh?  I've heard his name before.  That's some good work, $c.  Hopefully we can turn our attention back to the dragon menace now.  </RewardText>
