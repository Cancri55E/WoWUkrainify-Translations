  <Description>So be it. If the giants will not come to our aid, perhaps we can make use of these worms. There are sure to be some spawn with their brood mother in the cavern below. Take this box and capture 3 of their spawn and bring them to me.$b$bWhere diplomacy fails, enslaving is a perfectly viable alternative.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Enter the caverns in Crystal Vice and trap 3 Jormungar Spawn inside sturdy crates.  Be sure to pick the crates up after the Jormungar Spawn are trapped inside!$B$BBring the captured Jormungar Spawn back to Zort in the Crystal Vice.</LogDescription>
