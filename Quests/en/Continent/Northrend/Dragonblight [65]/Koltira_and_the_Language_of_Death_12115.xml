  <CompletionText>What is it, $r?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There are only two things in life that interest me, peon, and neither of them involve translating a Scourge tome for you.$B$BHowever... perhaps we could work something out that would benefit the both of us.$B$B&lt;Koltira unsheathes his weapon.&gt;$B$BThis is my runeblade, Byfrost. Byfrost thirsts for the blood of the Lich King and his minions, but first I must etch upon it runes of power: symbols of frost, blood, and unholy. Bring me suitable sources of power and I will translate your tome.</RewardText>
