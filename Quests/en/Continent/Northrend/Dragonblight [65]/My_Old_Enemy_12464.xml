  <Title>My Old Enemy</Title>
  <Description>My old enemy, High General Abbendis, has come to Northrend.$B$BSomehow she survived the attacks upon Tyr's Hand and brought a small force north. They've established New Hearthglen to the south.$B$BWhile they could prove useful in fighting the Scourge, Abbendis herself is far too shrewd an opponent to let live. Trust me, if we let them stand, she will be at our throats before the dust settles.$B$BSo, we'll deprive them of their leadership and go about our business. Bring me her head as proof.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver The High General's Head to Commander Eligor Dawnbringer at Wintergarde Keep.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It is done then?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>An unfortunate, but necessary action that we had to take in dealing with Abbendis. In another lifetime, I think I could have imagined fighting side-by-side with her.$B$B&lt;The commander's voice trails off as he reflects a moment before proceeding.&gt;$B$BI'm a little concerned about this grand admiral you describe. Barean Westwind you say? I can't believe that he's still alive. He must be ancient. We'll have to deal with him later, however.$B$BIn the meantime, I think you've earned a reward and a little R &amp; R.</RewardText>
