  <Title>Really Big Worm</Title>
  <Description>The jormungar have a spawnmother in the caverns below. We call her Rattlebore - a name that was gifted to her by an adventurer from the Plaguelands. I saw her only briefly as I was fighting off their initial onslaught - she is large enough to devour one of my young whole. This cavern will not be ours until she is removed from it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Enter the Ice Heart Cavern and slay Rattlebore.  If it is still in your possession, be sure to use Zort's Protective Elixir to protect you from the Jormungar's corrosive spit.$B$BReturn to Ko'char the Unbreakable in the Crystal Vice when the task is complete.</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>So she is dead. As it should be. Your intentions do indeed prove nobler than those of the runt.$B$BThrough the north canyon you will find Crystalsong Forest.  It is a cursed and dangerous place, $r. Should that be your next destination, proceed with caution. $b$bTake this for your efforts, little one, and leave this conflicted land with my blessing.</RewardText>
