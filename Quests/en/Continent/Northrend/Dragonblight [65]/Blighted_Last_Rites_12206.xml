  <Title>Blighted Last Rites</Title>
  <Description>Have you read the wanted poster? What is the high executor thinking?!$B$B&lt;Vicky looks around and continues in hushed tones.&gt;$B$BWe can't very well have those Scarlet Onslaught idiots being raised by their priests, or worse, rising as the Scourge, now can we?$B$BNo, I'm in total agreement with you, we have to do something about the corpses.$B$BI have just the thing. Take this blight that we just created and test it on the prisoner in the cage right here.$B$BNo muss, no fuss, no returning enemies.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Apothecary Vicky Levine at Venomspite has asked you to test the Flask of Blight upon the Scarlet Onslaught Prisoner.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you do it?$B$BHey, I forgot to tell you that you probably shouldn't let any of that stuff get on you! It's nasty, and you'll never get the stains out, let alone have a hell of a time healing the bubbled-away fleshy bits.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>WHAT?! That's impossible! We've perfected the blight. It has a one-hundred percent lethality.$B$B&lt;The apothecary wrings her hands, concern crossing her unliving visage. Clearly frustrated, she continues in an angry tone.&gt;$B$BThis is just really odd. Hand me that flask, $c. I'm not going to be known as the apothecary that ruined everything!</RewardText>
