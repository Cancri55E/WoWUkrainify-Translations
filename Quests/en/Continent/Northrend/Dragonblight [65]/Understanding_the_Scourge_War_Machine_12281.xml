  <Title>Understanding the Scourge War Machine</Title>
  <Description>We must take solace in the fact that Slinkin's death, while tragic, was for the greater good. His discovery coupled with your heroics in the mine and the samples you returned brings us one step closer to understanding the Scourge war machine.$B$BTake this package to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. It holds a sample of the strange ore and my analysis.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver Quarterflash's Package to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I heard about your bravery in the mine, $n.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Halford opens the package and reads the analysis.&gt;$B$BI am by no means a scientist, $n, so you'll have to forgive my plebian understanding of what has been written. Now, according to this analysis - assuming I have the brain power of at least an adolescent school boy - we still don't know jack squat about the Scourge war machine. The only thing we do know is that the Scourge uses this foul metal to craft its siege engines, armor and weaponry.$B$B&lt;Halford lets loose a long sigh.&gt;</RewardText>
