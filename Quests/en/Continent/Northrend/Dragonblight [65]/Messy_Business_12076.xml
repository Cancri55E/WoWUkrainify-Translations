  <Title>Messy Business</Title>
  <Description>Even at first glance, the sample you brought me shows obvious signs of some kind of corrosive spit. It would be a natural assumption that the same substance these worms use to burrow through the ground has allowed them a formidable weapon against the Ice Giants.$b$bTake this scraper and pick a fight with some of the worms. When they spit on you, use the scraper to remove it and bring it back to me.$B$BGet me a couple samples - I'm going to have to use it as the base for an elixir.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 2 Vials of Corrosive Spit from the Jormungar by using the scraper on yourself.  Bring the vials back to Zort in the Crystal Vice when your task is complete.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You seem to still have some spit on your shoulder there, $r. Be careful or it will burn right through your armor.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Still fresh.  Just a moment and I will mix this with the rest of the elixir that I have prepared.</RewardText>
