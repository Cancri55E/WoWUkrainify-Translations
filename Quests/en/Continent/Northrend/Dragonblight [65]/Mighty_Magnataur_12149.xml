  <Title>Mighty Magnataur</Title>
  <Description>Magnataur are hideously violent creatures... this is the main reason we rarely see them come together in any real numbers without killing each other. A powerful leader has stepped up somewhere among them and we need to hunt him down if we are to stop this threat. $B$BI will start asking around. I need you to disrupt them as much as possible in the meantime.$B$BEast of here there are 3 torches erected. Near them, there are 3 dominant Magnataur - put them down to buy us some time to hunt down this leader.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Hunt down and kill Bloodfeast, Iceshatter, and Drakegore east of Wyrmrest Temple.$B$BBloodfeast resides in the southeastern corner of the Dragon Wastes, just north of the Emerald Dragonshrine. Iceshatter patrols the northern edge of the Mirror of Dawn. Drakegore wanders at the bottom of the cliffs west of the Bronze Dragonshrine.$B$BReturn to Aurastrasza at Wyrmrest Temple once the magnataur have been slain.</LogDescription>
