  <Description>Hello. I am Hansel. Pleased to meet you, $g sir : ma'am;.$B$BThe high executor came to me and said, 'Hansel, I want you to get us new mounts.'$B$BWhere does he think dreadsteeds come from? The ground?$B$B&lt;whispering&gt; Actually, they do if you can find a horse graveyard.$B$BBut we don't have one of those, so what we need you to do is go south to New Hearthglen, kill the knights, take their riding crops, and steal their warhorses.$B$BRide the horse back to me here and hand over the reins, if you would.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Hansel Bauer at Venomspite has asked you to steal 3 Onslaught Warhorses and deliver them to him, handing over the reins when you do so.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I'm sure glad that you came around. I was afraid that I was going to have to go down there and rustle them up myself.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ah, nothing makes me happier than a job well done.$B$BYou've done Venomspite a great service in acquiring these horses, $c.</RewardText>
