  <Title>Soft Packaging</Title>
  <Description>I need some new packaging for the shrapnel bombs.  All the stuff I have is too hard and the shrapnel doesn't spread when it bursts.  $b$bWhat we need is some really thin animal hide.  Those jormungar tunnelers to the west might work... or perhaps the condors sifting through the dragon bones.  Go get me whatever you can find.
</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 12 Thin Animal Hides from the Jormungar Tunnelers or the Dragonbone Condors near Nozzlerust Post.  Once you've located the hides, return them to Zivlix.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How goes the hunt?  Do you have my hides?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good... good... these should do fine.  The shrapnel bombs are almost finished. $b$bWait... what happened to my ice shards?  Narf told me shards from those elementals should be enchanted, but they're melting just like the ones hanging from Narf's grumpy chin!</RewardText>
