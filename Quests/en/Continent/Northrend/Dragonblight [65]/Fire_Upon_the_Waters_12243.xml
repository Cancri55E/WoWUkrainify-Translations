  <Title>Fire Upon the Waters</Title>
  <Description>I have another mission for you.$B$BI was able to repurpose some of the blight to concoct my world-famous burning water. I want you to take it and set the sails of the Sinner's Folly ablaze!$B$BUse it from the dock. Once the sails are on fire, the deckhands will be busy putting them out, and you'll slip belowdecks to 'retrieve' the captain's rutters.$B$BYou'll find the ship on Crusader's Landing, below and south of New Hearthglen. Look for the captain's quarters on the first lower deck, behind the stairs.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Apothecary Vicky Levine at Venomspite has asked you to use her Apothecary's Burning Water to set the sails of the Sinner's Folly afire.$B$BWhile the deckhands are busy attempting to put the fires out, head belowdecks and retrieve Captain Shely's Rutters from the captain.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Please do NOT tell me that their sails were somehow protected from my burning water!$B$BI'd hate to have to test it out here again.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Ahhahahahahahahahaha!$B$BWithout their rutters, they've got nowhere to run to now.$B$BLooks to me like the end of the Scarlet Onslaught, and just when they were getting started. How sad.$B$BHeh.</RewardText>
