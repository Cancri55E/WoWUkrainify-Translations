  <Title>Return to the Earth</Title>
  <Description>I have another task that needs attention. I have brothers who are falling in the battle overhead and if we do not act quickly, they will only bolster the emberwyrm ranks.$B$BGet into the shrine through one of the other passes to the south or north... the Scourge presence should be lighter there.$B$BSearch the shrine for ruby acorns that have fallen from the tree and plant them near the bodies of my fallen brood. Through this, they can give new life... a proud fate for any of my kind.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Enter the Ruby Dragonshrine through one of the northern or southern passes and search for Ruby Acorns.  Use the Ruby Acorns on the fallen red dragons to return their bodies to the earth.  Return to Ceristrasz once the task is complete.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I started to worry that the Scourge in the shrine had claimed you. It is good that you yet live.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>In the earth, my brothers can grant life anew. You have saved them from a fate far worse than death.$B$BI don't know a word in your tongue that could express how much this means to my kind. Thank you, $r.</RewardText>
