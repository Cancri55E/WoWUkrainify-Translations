  <Title>The Forsaken Blight and You: How Not to Die</Title>
  <Description>The details behind the functionality of the blight are hardly important. All you need to know is that it does the job it was designed to do. I have managed to synthesize a strain of the blight that is inert.$B$B&lt;Middleton uncorks a vial and inhales.&gt;$B$BSee, my body is still, mostly, intact. Now mix this with a reactive agent and we'd all be turned to shapeless piles of goo.$B$BOn the beach south of here you will find pathetic specters of Alliance soldiers past. Slay them and bring me ectoplasmic residue.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Chief Plaguebringer Middleton at Venomspite in Dragonblight wants you to bring him 10 Ectoplasmic Residue.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The residue will be used as the reactive agent to activate the blight!
</CompletionText>
