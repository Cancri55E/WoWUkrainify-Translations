  <Title>Smoke 'Em Out</Title>
  <Description>There are still pockets of cowardly Venture Company men holed up in some of the buildings at the center of Venture Bay. I need every man I can spare out there fighting against the Horde, but we can't allow those Venture Company stragglers to camp out in those buildings, either.$B$BMaybe we can "convince" them to make for their ship. Take this smoke bomb and use it to smoke out the stragglers from their places in the bunkhouse, sawmill, or stables. Don't get too close, though; they probably bite.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Smoke Bomb to drive 20 Venture Company Stragglers from their buildings and then report to Sergeant Downey.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you smoked out the last of the Venture Company guys yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, soldier! Now the rest of the men can focus their efforts on the Horde.</RewardText>
