  <Title>Cultivating an Image</Title>
  <Description>Now that we've got the uniform, we've got to get enough information to complete your camouflage.$B$BRaegar brought along this camera to document the team's finds, but I have a different use in mind. I want you to take it with you to Dun Argol and use it to capture the images of iron dwarves.$B$BOf course, your models aren't going to be a cooperative lot, so you may have to, err... subdue them first. Bring back the camera and the images when you're done.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Kilian's Camera to record the images of 8 Iron Dwarves in Dun Argol, then return to Mountaineer Kilian at Prospector's Point.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get those snapshots?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good, these should do. Now, to create a kit to pass you off as a convincing iron dwarf.</RewardText>
