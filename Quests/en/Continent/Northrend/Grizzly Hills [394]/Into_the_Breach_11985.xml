  <Title>Into the Breach</Title>
  <Description>If we can't overcome the defenders inside Thor Modan, the iron dwarves can hold out forever. The Earthen are bravely taking on the constructs built by the sons of iron, but they cannot break into the city.$B$BThe tunnels narrow too quickly for my fellow giants to be of use, so our options are few. Would you be willing to venture into the city and kill the dwarf commanding the resistance?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kurun on the hill overlooking Thor Modan wants you to kill Iron Thane Argrum.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to kill the commander?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n. The loss of the iron dwarf commander should be enough to break the remaining defenders. The Earthen should be able to deal with the survivors.</RewardText>
