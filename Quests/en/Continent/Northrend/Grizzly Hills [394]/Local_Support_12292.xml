  <Title>Local Support</Title>
  <Description>We've reached a deadlock with the Horde in Grizzly Hills.  Our forces are just about evenly matched and all signs so far have pointed to a stalemate.$B$BUntil this morning, that is.  The local trappers have requested our help.  Apparently the Horde took something that belongs to them... a relic of some sort.$B$BWe get this back for them and they'll give us the edge we need.  Head to the Evergreen Trading Post, west of Conquest Hold and look for a cedar chest.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Lieutenant Dumont at Amberpine Lodge wants you to go to Evergreen Trading Post and obtain the Cedar Chest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You bring me that box, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It's locked, isn't it?  It looks pretty ordinary.$B$B&lt;Lieutenant Dumont Shakes the chest, producing a rattling wooden sound.&gt;$B$BNo matter, I suppose.  If this gets us the edge we need against the Horde, then I could care less if the cure for the Plague was in there. </RewardText>
