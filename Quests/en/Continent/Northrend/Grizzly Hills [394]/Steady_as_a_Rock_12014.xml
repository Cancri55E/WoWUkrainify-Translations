  <Description>Orlond's notes indicate that he brought a piece of equipment called a portable seismograph with him, but the device is nowhere to be seen.$B$BThe survey log shows that Orlond completed all his readings in the Thor Modan tunnel, save one labeled the 'east end of the exposed tunnel.'$B$BThe last entry in the log indicates Orlond tried to take refuge in the water and was attacked by subterranean threshers. They might've taken his equipment.You'll need to recover it before you can take the last reading.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve the Portable Seismograph and use it to take stability readings in Thor Modan, then return to Brugar Stoneshear at the Westfall Brigade Encampment.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What did you find?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Brugar looks over the report.&gt;$B$BThis isn't good at all. Even if we could excavate the tunnels behind the blockage, there's no guarantee they wouldn't collapse again. It looks like some of these areas haven't been used in generations. We'll have to give Captain Gryan the bad news.</RewardText>
