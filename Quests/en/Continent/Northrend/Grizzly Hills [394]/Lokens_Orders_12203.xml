  <Title>Loken's Orders</Title>
  <Description>I've created everything else you'll need for your overseer disguise kit. Try not to retch when you put it on. I took pains to make it as true to reality as possible.$B$BTake the kit with you southeast to Dun Argol, use it to disguise yourself, then go to the easternmost building on the broad middle tier of the city.$B$BThere, you should see a pedestal where the thane and overseers receive their orders from this Loken. Activate it while disguised and learn all you can from the communication.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Disguise yourself as an Iron Rune Overseer, intercept the message from Loken, then report to Scout Vor'takh at Camp Oneqwah.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What did you learn of Loken?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>So he means to foment civil war between the factions of the titans' creation? Why does this titan city of Ulduar mean so much to him? I suppose this is what Kurun and his giants are hoping to prevent.$B$BWell, I doubt we're in a position to keep the giants from fighting each other, but we can find a way to use this to our advantage. I must inform our leaders at once.</RewardText>
