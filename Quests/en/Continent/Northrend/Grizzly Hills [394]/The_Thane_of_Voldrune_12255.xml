  <Title>The Thane of Voldrune</Title>
  <Description>Now that you've captured the flame-imbued talismans and weakened Voldrune's defenses, we can strike at its leader, Thane Torvald Eriksson.$B$BThe thane's favorite mount is an unruly proto-drake he calls Flamebringer. It is kept bound in chains in the western part of Voldrune, but with the talismans, you should be able to control it long enough to use it against the thane.$B$BOnce you have Flamebringer under your control, search the tops of the towers of Voldrune for the thane and show him no mercy.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Flamebringer to defeat Thane Torvald Eriksson and report to Woodsman Drake at Amberpine Lodge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you overcome the thane? We cannot risk leaving him in power.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good work, $n. I doubt any of the woodsmen would've wanted to take a crack at the proto-drake, but we couldn't afford to let the Dragonflayers build a base of power in Grizzly Hills. If only the Horde was so easily dealt with...</RewardText>
