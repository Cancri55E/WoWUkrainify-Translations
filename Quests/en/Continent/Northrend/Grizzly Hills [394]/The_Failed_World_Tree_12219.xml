  <Description>My ancestors once planted a tree in the middle of the Grizzly Hills.$B$BIt was called Vordrassil and it was to become a world tree.$B$BFor reasons long forgotten, after the tree was fully grown, they decided it needed to be destroyed.

Bring me slime samples so I can begin my work and the earth can be healed.</Description>
