  <Title>Gavrock</Title>

I can only hope we have silenced it for the last time.$B$BThe iron dwarves can still use their magic to capture and enslave my brothers. Gavrock is searching for a way to free the runed giants. Look for him on a small cluster of islands, called the Ruins of Tethys, off the central part of the Eastwind Shore to the south.</Description>
