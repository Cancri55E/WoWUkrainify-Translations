  <Title>We Have the Power</Title>
  <Description>Well, we've got the shell of a golem, but that's not good enough for Tormak. He doesn't realize that these things don't just come together and miraculously start working! We're going to need power cells to animate it.$B$BWhen I was in Dun Argol, I noticed that Rune-Smith Durar and Rune-Smith Kathorn were the ones who manufactured the cells. We'll need one from each to power our golem.$B$BYou should be able to find each rune-smith in his workshop on the central level of Dun Argol.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Durar's Power Cell and Kathorn's Power Cell to Prospector Rokar at Camp Oneqwah.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do you have those power cells?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Rokar takes the batteries from you.&gt;$B$BThese are low, but they'll be enough to start up the golem. He's nowhere near ready for battle, though.</RewardText>
