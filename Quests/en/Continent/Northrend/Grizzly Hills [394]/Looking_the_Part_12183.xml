  <Title>Looking the Part</Title>
  <Description>If, as Prospector Varana said, only certain irons are permitted to communicate with this Loken, it'll probably be the overseers who have the privilege.$B$BWe have to get you in there to see what all this is about, but it won't be easy. The first step will be to get a proper uniform for you.$B$BThen, we'll worry about doing your makeup.$B$BFind one of the overseers at Dun Argol, kill him, and bring back his uniform. If you get blood on it, you'll have only yourself to blame.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring an Overseer's Uniform to Mountaineer Kilian at Prospector's Point.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get the uniform?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Kilian takes the uniform from you.&gt;$B$BThis should do. I won't have time to sew on a little patch with '$n' embroidered on it or anything, but anyone looking closely at you should be convinced that you're an overseer by the time we're done with you.</RewardText>
