We must teach these savages not to cross us.$B$BOur scouts have located what's left of the Silverbrook trappers... you know, the ones you didn't get to douse in flames.  Apparently they're blockading the road to the southeast... perhaps they're trying to box us in.$B$BHead to the Forest's Edge post and take care of them.  Their leader's reported to be a man named Vladek... make sure he's dealt with.</Description>
