  <Title>Uncovering the Tunnels</Title>
  <Description>The first place we'll search for entrances to the Thor Modan tunnel system will be the outlying buildings.$B$BAs I left the site with my men, it looked like the iron dwarf defenders were taking refuge inside the buildings. Be careful as you explore them.$B$BAny tunnel entrances are likely to be toward the back of the buildings. I'm not sure what Stoutmantle thinks we're going to find down there, but I doubt the iron dwarves will make the search easy.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Brugar Stoneshear at the Westfall Brigade Encampment wants you to explore the North Building, the East Building, and the South Building of Thor Modan.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I don't suppose you managed to find the tunnels, did you?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Brugar utters a stream of foul dwarven words.&gt;$B$BNo entrances? None?$B$BNo, of course it couldn't be that easy. Well, I suppose there's no avoiding a foray into the city proper. My boys'll never get back to their real work.</RewardText>
