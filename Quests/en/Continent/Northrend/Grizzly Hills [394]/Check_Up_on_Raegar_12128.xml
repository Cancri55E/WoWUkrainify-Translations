  <Title>Check Up on Raegar</Title>
  <Description>With all the excitement about the army trying to move through Thor Modan, I'd almost forgotten about Raegar's crew down at Prospector's Point.$B$BI sent Raegar and his assistants, along with a mountaineer friend, down to establish a small post near Dun Argol, at the southern end of the Eastwind Shore.$B$BThey were to investigate the iron dwarf presence in the southern hills, but I haven't received any reports yet. Could you check up on them if you're going down that way?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Raegar Breakbrow at Prospector's Point.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Hmm... you don't look like a research assistant, which is just as well. The iron dwarves look to be preparing for war, and my research team hasn't returned. We could use some help around here.</RewardText>
