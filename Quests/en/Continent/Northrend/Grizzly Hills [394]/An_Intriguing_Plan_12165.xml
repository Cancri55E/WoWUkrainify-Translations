  <Title>An Intriguing Plan</Title>
  <Description>Prospector Rokar has decided to help us. He's concocted a plan to use the iron dwarves' strength against them.$B$BI must admit, our new 'friend' is more insightful than I'd given him credit for. He's correct in that our numbers are too few for a direct attack.$B$BTravel to Dun Argol, in the snowy regions to the southeast, and capture all the parts of their war golem blueprints from the iron rune-smiths there. Bring the assembled blueprint to Rokar and we'll see if his plan has any merit.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the completed War Golem Blueprints to Prospector Rokar at Camp Oneqwah.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Do... do you have those blueprints I asked for?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>So Tormak's going to go ahead with the plan? I suppose he wouldn't have sent you if he didn't.$B$BOh, bother... Now how am I going to figure out how to put this together under all this pressure?</RewardText>
