  <Title>Why Fabricate When You Can Appropriate?</Title>

We don't have access to a foundry, much less materials, but there's a whole load of parts up in Dun Argol.$B$BYour job?$B$BGive them a new home.$B$BThey're likely to be scattered around any of the buildings where the iron rune-smiths are working, and I wouldn't blame the irons for being cranky when you try to filch their handiwork. The more parts you can bring, the better we can make this golem.</Description>
