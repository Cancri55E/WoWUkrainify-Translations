  <Title>The Perfect Plan</Title>
  <Description>The iron dwarves are making no secret of the fact that they're preparing for war. With their giants, golems, and lightning elementals, they'd have a technological advantage against the Westfall Brigade. If they don't find passage north in time, the irons could take them by surprise.$B$BWe've got to tie them up here, and I've got just the way to do it. Dun Argol is full of rune-smiths churning out war golems. They carry plans for specific pieces, so you'll need to find and assemble all the parts.</Description>

  <CompletionText>Were you able to get those plans from the rune-smiths?</CompletionText>
