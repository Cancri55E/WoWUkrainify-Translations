  <Title>Blackriver Skirmish</Title>
  <Description>The Venture Company's on its way out of Grizzly Hills.  They used to run logging operations here, but things got a little too dangerous for them.$B$BTheir abandoned sites are up for grabs and we sure as hell can't let the Horde get their hands on them.$B$BThe Blackriver Logging Camp is the smallest of the three logging sites in this zone, but we still need it.  Do your part and fend off the Horde forces.  Any lumber they get here will be made into weapons to be used against us elsewhere.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Scout Captain Carter wants you to kill 10 Horde units or players in the Blackriver Logging Camp.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How's the hunt going?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Nice work, $n.  We could use a few more folks like you up here.  We could really show the Horde not to mess with us.</RewardText>
