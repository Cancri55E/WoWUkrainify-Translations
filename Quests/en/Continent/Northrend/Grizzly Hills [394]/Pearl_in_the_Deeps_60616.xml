  <Title>Pearl in the Deeps</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The oracle draws a circle in the sand, then points down into the deeps. There is something round down there that she is after, perhaps a pearl or stone?

The oracle motions for you to wait a moment before you leave. She waves her hands around frantically, then places them under her mouth, mimicking two large fangs.

You take this as a warning that there may be something waiting for you in the icy darkness.&gt;</Description>
