  <Title>Put on Your Best Face for Loken</Title>
  <Description>Using the images you've captured, I've created everything you need for your overseer disguise kit. You'll make a fine iron dwarf, if I do say so myself.$B$BTake the kit with you to Dun Argol, use it to disguise yourself, then go to the easternmost building on the broad middle tier of the city.$B$BThere, you should see a pedestal where the thane and overseers receive their orders from this Loken. Activate it while disguised and learn all you can from the communication.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Disguise yourself as an Iron Rune Overseer, intercept the message from Loken, then report to Mountaineer Kilian at Prospector's Point.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did the disguise work?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Could it be that Loken isn't really exaggerating? The titans' stone and iron sons fighting against each other for control of the ancient city of Ulduar. This is madness, $n and it could destroy our only chance to learn the true history of dwarvenkind!</RewardText>
