You'll find that here at Conquest Hold, we buy and sell what Krenna wants us to buy and sell... at the price that Krenna wants us to buy and sell.$B$BAll this is stifling business.  I'm hoping to make a little bit of coin on the side and feed our grunts at the same time.  Why don't you go hunt down some stag and bring me the venison?$B$BThey're numerous in the area, so bring me only the best meat.</Description>
