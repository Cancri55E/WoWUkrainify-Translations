  <Title>Secrets of the Flamebinders</Title>
  <Description>Even as we attempt to fight off the Horde, the Dragonflayer tribe musters in their village of Voldrune, near the coast to the south.$B$BThe most powerful warriors in the village are granted flame-imbued talismans that give them the ability to control powerful, savage proto-drakes. If we can gain control of one of these drakes, perhaps we can use it to neutralize the threat posed by Voldrune.$B$BThe Dragonflayer flamebinders create the talismans and imbue them with power. Kill them and take the talismans.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 3 Flame-Imbued Talismans to Woodsman Drake at Amberpine Lodge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you collect those talismans?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>With the talismans in hand, the drake will have no choice but to obey you. I can't wait to see the look on the thane's face when he realizes you've commandeered his proto-drake.</RewardText>
