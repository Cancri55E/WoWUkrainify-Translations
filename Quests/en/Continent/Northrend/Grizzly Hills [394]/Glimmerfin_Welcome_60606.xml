  <Title>Glimmerfin Welcome</Title>
  <Description>First thing's first, they're probably hungry. Life up here in the cold isn't quite as easy as it is elsewhere, and even the most acclimated murlocs sometimes have trouble finding food.

We're going to need to feed them, but also help them find food for themselves.

They're already watching you, so search the area around where you found the murlocs for food sources and show them what to hunt. Then bring the meat to their leader--just look for the biggest one.</Description>
