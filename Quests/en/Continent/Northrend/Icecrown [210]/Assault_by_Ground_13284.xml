  <Title>Assault by Ground</Title>
  <Description>Greetings $c.$B$BOur troops have been attempting to storm Ymirheim for some time, but these vrykul are far more vicious than any we've faced before. They've been ambushing us repeatedly as we try to make it up the pass, and we've lost a lot of men.$B$BIf you want to lend yourself to the battle and help get my squad to the gates of Ymirheim safely, we will gladly reward you for your efforts. Once at the gates, we'll dig in and wait for reinforcements to catch up to us.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Escort the Skybreaker troops to the gates of Ymirheim. Return to Ground Commander Koup at the edge of the glacier east of Ymirheim for compensation after the task is complete.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you get some of my men up safely?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You have my thanks.$B$BThis has been a brutal operation, but we haven't had any great options otherwise - they're being equally as unforgiving to our aerial assault. We need to rout these vrykul if we're going to stand any chance of pressing on in Icecrown.$B$BWe're likely to need more help later. Please lend yourself to the battle again should the chance present itself.</RewardText>
