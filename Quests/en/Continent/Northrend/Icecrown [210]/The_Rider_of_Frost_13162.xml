  <Title>The Rider of Frost</Title>
  <Description>Sapph... Sapph's a death knight like no other. She'll shower you with sweet words and you'll swear that she has no evil within her heart, and then she'll run you through without even breaking her smile.$B$BI have no fear that you'll be able to best Sapph, but do not grow overconfident. Her strength lies in lulling her victims into a false ease, shortly before shattering them with a fierce barrage of frost attacks.$B$BDo not let your guard down, and do not underestimate her.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering wants you to kill Sapph, the Rider of Frost.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Are we rid of her?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I can't deny, I'll miss her laugh... and that smile that would creep onto her face just before she killed someone. A little less need to watch my back though, so I suppose I can't complain.</RewardText>
