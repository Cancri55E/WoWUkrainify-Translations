That goes two-fold for the Ymirjar. They have shown no restraint in proving to us why the Lich King deemed them worthy.$B$BGround Commander Koup is overseeing the assault. The city itself is located in the center of Icecrown - Koup's troops are positioned near the edge of the glacier, east of the city.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Report to Ground Commander Koup at the edge of the glacier east of Ymirheim.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Welcome to hell, soldier.$B$BMy men are leading the assault on the gate from this position, and we're dropping some infiltrators in the city via air - we need more people on both fronts. I have a feeling that this attack will be going on for some time.</RewardText>
