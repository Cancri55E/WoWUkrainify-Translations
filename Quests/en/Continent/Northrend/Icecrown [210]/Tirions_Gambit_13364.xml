  <Title>Tirion's Gambit</Title>
  <Description>Just this morning, my scouts informed me of a Cult of the Damned procession leaving from Icecrown Citadel to the Cathedral of Darkness, bearing an artifact.$B$BAnd now I learn that it might be Arthas's own heart... a thing containing the last bit of his remaining humanity.$B$BThis is a sign of the Light.  As long as such an artifact exists, there is a chance that Arthas Menethil can become a man again!$B$BMeet me at the cathedral's entrance.  Be sure to bring a cultist's hood -- we're going incognito.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Tirion Fordring, at the Crusader's Pinnacle, wants you to obtain and wear a Cultist Acolyte's Hood and meet him at the entrance of the Cathedral of Darkness, northwest of Icecrown Citadel.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Light be with you, $n.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I do not view what we just went through as a failure, $n... quite the opposite.$B$BBy allowing me to peer into his heart, you allowed me to confirm what I needed to know.  There is no Arthas Menethil anymore -- there is only the Lich King.</RewardText>
