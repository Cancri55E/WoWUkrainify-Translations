  <Title>Blinding the Eyes in the Sky</Title>
  <Description>The Alliance has somehow managed to field a squadron of recon vehicles over the Valley of Fallen Heroes and Icecrown Glacier, the broad areas west of Aldur'thar.$B$BThey cannot be permitted to take the lead in this fight. Chief Engineer Copperclaw has supplied me with the perfect weapon to deal with this threat -- he calls his new missile the SGM-3. I have his assurances that it will take out the Alliance flying machines in a single hit. Go and use this weapon to give us the upper hand.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the SGM-3 to destroy 6 Skybreaker Recon Fighters, then report back to Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar aboard Orgrim's Hammer.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you eliminated the Alliance's reconnaissance operations in the western part of the glacier?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good. Fewer Alliance pests to stand in our way. We'll show them what true warriors look like.</RewardText>
