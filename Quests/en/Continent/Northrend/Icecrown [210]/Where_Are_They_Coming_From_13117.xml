  <Title>Where Are They Coming From?</Title>
  <Description>The Lich King's tireless minions labor away night and day to assemble scores of abominations and flesh giants down there in the Fleshwerks.$B$BYet, that is not enough. More and more skeletal constructors keep appearing to increase the pace of work.$B$BIf we do not discover where they're coming from and how they're able to work so quickly, we'll be overrun before we can act in force. Search to the southeast and see if you can find the source of these skeletons.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Investigate a Summoning Altar in the eastern part of the Fleshwerks, then report back to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you found the source of the skeletons?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;You tell the darkrider about your discoveries at the summoning altar.&gt;$B$BI suspected such. We can't let this continue. Our first priority is to destroy those summoning altars and then deal with the mess the Scourge has already created here.</RewardText>
