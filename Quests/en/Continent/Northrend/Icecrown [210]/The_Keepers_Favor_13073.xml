  <Title>The Keeper's Favor</Title>
  <Description>There are those of this world that tap into power unrestricted by the bounds of our mortal frames - powers of restoration, powers of life, and powers of light.  And Bridenbrad, this is no ordinary man... his valor and devotion shine through. We can only hope that one of these beings will intervene and bring this hero back from a fate worse than death.$B$BGo now and speak to Arch Druid Lilliandra in the Argent Vanguard... request passage to Moonglade and seek the aid of Keeper Remulos.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Highlord Tirion Fordring at Crusaders' Pinnacle has requested that you secure passage from Arch Druid Lilliandra and speak to Keeper Remulos in Moonglade.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Hello child.$B$BI understand Tirion's request and trust in his judgment, we will see what we can do for this Crusader Bridenbrad. What you ask is no simple task - the Scourge are not of this world, and many have failed in attempting to strip their corruption over the years.$B$BIn a being of nobility and light, all is not without hope.</RewardText>
