Go now with your friends and speak with Geirrvif the val'kyr. The challengers that she will offer you within Valhalas are sure to require their help.$B$BGood luck.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Geirrvif in Valhalas.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You have bested our finest warriors. Your name is renowned, $n.$B$BPerhaps you think that this concerns me: it does not. If they can fall to you then they are not worthy and should be nothing but lowly vargul!$B$BBut perhaps I can give you and your friends different sport. Valhalas is also a place for combat of all types with many different kinds of foes.$B$BSpeak to me again when you and your friends are ready to proceed.
