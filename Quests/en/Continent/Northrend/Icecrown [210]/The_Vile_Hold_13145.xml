  <Title>The Vile Hold</Title>
  <Description>We need to know what we're up against.$B$BUse the eye of dominion to assume control of a lithe stalker and scout out the area. There are a few spots in particular I saw when flying in that I want you to get a closer look at: the overlook in the northeast, the work area in the southeast, the large forge near the center, and the ritual area in the southwest.$B$BThe stalker can leap far and won't be hurt by large falls - use that to your advantage to get up and down from those ramparts.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Vereth the Cunning at the Rise of Suffering has requested that you use a Lithe Stalker to scout out Malykriss.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Flying may be a bit more graceful, but there's no way that we could get in as close as the stalker can without being detected.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent work. It seems more death knights remained loyal to Arthas than I initially thought.$B$BHe certainly is sparing nothing in his attempt to replace Acherus. A pure saronite citadel would be hard to destroy indeed. There's no need to destroy it though... we can halt production and put down these death knight leaders here and now, before they become a real threat.$B$BMost importantly, we need to disrupt them enough to get those death knights away from from the leaders so that we can make our strike.</RewardText>
