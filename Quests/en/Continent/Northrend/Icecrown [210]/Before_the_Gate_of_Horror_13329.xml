  <Title>Before the Gate of Horror</Title>
  <Description>The Conflagration, the ground before Corp'rethar, south of the Ironwall Rampart, is where the Lich King's elite soldiers have formed up to defend the citadel.$B$BLed by a contingent of death knights, a legion of skeletal reavers bars the way. I fear that even when these reavers fall, the Scourge will simply reconstitute them and send them back at us.$B$BI've come up with a plan to stop this, but I have no way of knowing if it will work. Take this solution and use it to dissolve the remains of the reavers.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Koltira Deathweaver, aboard Orgrim's Hammer, wants you to use the Volatile Acid to dissolve the remains of 6 Skeletal Reavers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you done as I asked?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Koltira listens to your report.&gt;$B$BGood. I'll have the engineers mix up as much of that acid as they can before we prepare to assault Corp'rethar with the main force.</RewardText>
