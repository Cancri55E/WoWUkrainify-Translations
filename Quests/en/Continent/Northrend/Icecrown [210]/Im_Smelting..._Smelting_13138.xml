  <Title>I'm Smelting... Smelting!</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Olakin turns one of the shards over in an armored fist.&gt;$B$BThese could pierce armor with enough force. We have to find out what they're made of and what the Lich King intends to do with them.$B$BTo the east, nestled next to Icecrown Citadel itself, lies Malykriss. From the few reports we have, it's full of smelting and smithing equipment. Bring these shards there, and smelt them in one of the open furnaces on the bottom level of Malykriss. Once the metal has been reformed, we can identify it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Bag of Jagged Shards near one of the bottom level Malykriss furnaces. Return to Crusader Olakin Sainrith at Blackwatch with the Smelted Metal Bar.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you smelted those fragments yet?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There is no doubt, this is raw saronite. We've seen weapons made from it in the hands of the Lich King's chosen before, but this is the first time it's been used to arm anything else. The scale of that mining operation must be huge.</RewardText>
