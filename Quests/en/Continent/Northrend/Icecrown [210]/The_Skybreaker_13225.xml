  <Description>We were neck deep in Scourge and Horde. The screams of the dying covered that field. It was torturous... unrelenting!$B$BAt some point my body gave out. I fell, only to be awoken by the Argent Crusade. They pulled me out of the Broken Front and brought me here. I'm not going to make it. Grant a dying soldier one last wish, $r? Our base, the Skybreaker, flies high above Icecrown. It is there that you'll find my commanding officer, High Captain Bartlett. Tell him that I died a soldier of the Alliance.</Description>
