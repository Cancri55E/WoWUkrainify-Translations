  <Title>Preparations for War</Title>
  <Description>You there!$B$BYou look like you have some wits about you. We could use some more able bodies in Icecrown.$B$BThe Alliance scum rushed into Icecrown ahead of us, unprepared, and got just what they deserved for their impatience. We took our time, we made ready, and soon we will mount a true assault from one of the most advanced pieces of engineering known to Azeroth - Orgrim's Hammer. The Alliance don't stand a chance, and neither does Arthas.$B$BSpeak to me when you're ready to depart and lend a hand.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Sky-Reaver Klum to secure passage to Orgrim's Hammer in Icecrown, and then report to Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Welcome to Orgrim's Hammer.$B$BFrom here we are laying our groundwork for the assault on Arthas. There's a lot of preparation to be done, but before we can get into the real meat of it, we want to make sure that the Argent Crusade is adequately reinforced - we're going to need their help later.$B$BIf you have not already, speak to Brother Keltan on the main deck.</RewardText>
