  <Description>There were rumors about the events you speak of among the death knights.  I always expected the story to be more... symbolic.$B$BWe must warn others, but we must be discreet.  As soon as the Lich King knows we're making our move, he'll move the location of the heart -- we'll never get a chance like this again.$B$BThe Horde and the Alliance have been infiltrated by the Cult of the Damned before.  The Ebon Blade operates too close to the Scourge.$B$BWe have to speak to Tirion Fordring and his Argent Crusade.</Description>
