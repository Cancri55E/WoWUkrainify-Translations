  <Title>Vereth the Cunning</Title>
  <Description>I've already heard some rumors regarding Malykriss and Arthas's new death knight order, but I assumed it nothing more than filling the void. These numbers suggest he's trying to take it up a notch though.$B$BWe dispatched one of our best to Malykriss not long ago - Vereth the Cunning. You should be able to find him on the Rise of Suffering, just west of Malykriss, and inside the Court of Bones.$B$BTry not to draw too much attention on your way in.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Report to Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering in Icecrown.</LogDescription>
