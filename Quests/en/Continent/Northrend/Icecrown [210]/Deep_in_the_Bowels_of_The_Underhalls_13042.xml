He does, however, have an assistant.$B$BBeat the information out of his apprentice, and then dispose of the body.</Description>
  <LogDescription>The Bone Witch in Njorndar Village has asked you to beat information out of Apprentice Osterkilgr concerning what Dr. Terrible is truly up to.$B$BYou are then to slay the apprentice.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You have not finished what I asked of you.$B$BPlease leave and do not return until you have done so or I will be very cross.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Very interesting. It sounds to me that you handled that perfectly. I'm surprised that the doctor was using a vargul as an assistant given what he was working on.</RewardText>
