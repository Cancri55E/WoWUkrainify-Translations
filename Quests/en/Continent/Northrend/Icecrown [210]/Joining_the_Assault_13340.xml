  <Title>Joining the Assault</Title>
  <Description>We need more men to join the main assault on Ymirheim.$B$BAny warrior with half a brain can tell you that vrykul are fierce fighters and should not be taken lightly. That goes two-fold for the Ymirjar. They have shown us no restraint in proving why the Lich King deemed them worthy.$B$BGround Commander Xutjja is overseeing the assault. The city itself is located in the center of Icecrown - Xutjja's troops are positioned near the edge of the glacier, north of the city.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Report to Ground Commander Xutjja at the edge of the glacier north of Ymirheim.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>More meat for the grinder. Welcome to hell, soldier.$B$BMy men are leading the assault on the gate from this position, and we're dropping some infiltrators in the city via air - we need more people on both fronts. I have a feeling that this attack will be going on for some time.</RewardText>
