  <Title>Death's Gaze</Title>
  <Description>The Fleshwerks is a vast operation, and it will be difficult to keep an eye on all that transpires there. Fortunately, I have a plan.$B$B&lt;Arly produces an orb from the folds of her cloak and shows it to you.&gt;$B$BThis is a death's gaze orb. With it, we can observe the Scourge's actions and decide how best to strike.$B$BPlace these orbs on the stands at three crucial areas -- the abomination lab and the flesh giant lab to the southwest, along with the area surrounding the green cauldron far to the west.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Death's Gaze Orb to place orbs on the Abomination Lab Orb Stand, the Flesh Giant Lab Orb Stand, and the Cauldron Area Orb Stand, then return to Darkrider Arly at Blackwatch.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you placed those orbs?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Darkrider Arly closes her eyes and seems to focus on something far away.&gt;$B$BWith the eyes of death itself, I watch our enemy. With this knowledge, we will utterly destroy them.</RewardText>
