  <Title>The Grand (Admiral's) Plan</Title>
  <Description>At first this note looks like any of the other intel that you've been looking for. However, a quick perusal of its contents disabuses you of this notion.$B$BThe letter conveys that Grand Admiral Westwind is present somewhere on the island, but that he is keeping himself secluded for now. He speaks of a glorious day that is coming soon in which the Scarlet Onslaught will wash over first the Lich King and then the rest of world to finally bring order to Azeroth.$B$BThe lord-commander will want to see this!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver the Note from the Grand Admiral to Lord-Commander Arete at Death's Rise.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Scarlet Onslaught intel is to be delivered to Aurochs Grimbane.$B$B&lt;The lord-commander gives you an expectant look by way of a dismissal.&gt;</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>A note written by Westwind? Why didn't you say so?$b$b&lt;Arete tears the letter from your hand to read it.&gt;$b$bThe fool! He's actually here?!$b$b&lt;The lord-commander laughs.&gt;$b$bThis is new information. I wonder how he imagines that he's going to conquer the world once he's taken down the Lich King?
