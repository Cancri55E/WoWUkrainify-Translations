  <Description>The Knights of the Ebon Blade want to take the Scourge base known as The Shadow Vault to the northwest. I have a contact in their group who has asked for help.$B$BThe first step is to blind the Lich King. He's using a device known as The Ocular to watch the area, which floats above the vault's spires.$B$BOur goblins have created something for you to use against it. After the 'eye' has been destroyed, find Baron Sliver on the vault grounds. He's pretending to still be under the Lich King's will.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy The Ocular and then report to Baron Sliver at The Shadow Vault.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The Ocular still stands! Koltira was a fool to trust you.$B$BWhoever you are, don't return again until it is destroyed. My position here must not be compromised!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Perhaps now we can really get something done. Don't be fooled though, the Lich King can still 'see' through his Scourge minions.$B$BThat's why you're here.</RewardText>
