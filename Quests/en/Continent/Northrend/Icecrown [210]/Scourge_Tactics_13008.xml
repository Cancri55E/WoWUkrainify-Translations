  <Title>Scourge Tactics</Title>
  <Description>We had the element of surprise on our side! We blew a hole in the side of the mountain and charged into Scourgeholme. Scourge opposition was fierce and it wasn't long until we were overwhelmed. We fell back to the valley and began raining artillery down on the Scourge that followed. This held them back for awhile until... Those monsters began using crusaders as living shields. We had to stop shelling for fear of killing our own soldiers.$B$BFree our crusaders trapped on the field outside the base, $c!</Description>
