  <Title>Assault by Air</Title>
  <Description>Alright scrub, I've got something to keep you from being a complete waste.$B$BA unit of highly trained infiltrators is ready to be dropped inside of Ymirheim. The vrykul inside have automated spear guns that have been ripping our transports to shreds, so we had the engineers on Orgrim's Hammer whip us up a suppression turret.$B$BYou're the gunner. Launch rounds at their spear guns to obscure their vision and clog their gears. See to it that my men all make their drops and the transport stays in one piece.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ground Commander Xutjja at the edge of the glacier north of Ymirheim has ordered you to use the Kor'kron Suppression Turret to keep the Kor'kron Troop Transport alive long enough to make all of its drops.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Get the job done?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Only partly useless then. Good work.</RewardText>
