  <Title>Before the Gate of Horror</Title>
  <Description>The Conflagration, the ground before Corp'rethar, south of the Ironwall Rampart, is where the Lich King's elite soldiers have formed up to defend the citadel.$B$BLed by a contingent of death knights, a legion of skeletal reavers bars the way. I fear that even when these reavers fall, the Scourge will simply reconstitute them and send them back at us.$B$BI've come up with a plan to stop this, but I have no way of knowing if it will work. Take this solution and use it to dissolve the remains of the reavers.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Thassarian, aboard the Skybreaker, wants you to use the Volatile Acid to dissolve the corpses of 6 Skeletal Reavers.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you tested the solution out on the reavers?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Thassarian listens as you describe your successful tests.&gt;$B$BSo the acid worked? Good. We'll need it when the army goes up against the reavers in force.</RewardText>
