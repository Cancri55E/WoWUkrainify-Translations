  <Title>Assault by Air</Title>
  <Description>I've got some boys suited and ready for their drops inside of Ymirheim. I could use you to see them there safely.$B$BInside the walls, the vrykul have set up some kind of automated spear guns that have been tearing up our transports. We had our engineers install a Suppression Turret to shut down those spear guns - just fire a round near any gun and the smoke should block its sight and clog its gears.$B$BHop on the turret and see to it that all my boys make it to their drops in one piece.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ground Commander Koup at the edge of the glacier east of Ymirheim has ordered you to use the Skybreaker Suppression Turret to keep the Skybreaker Troop Transport alive long enough to make all of its drops.

  <CompletionText>Did you get my boys inside?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent work, soldier. We could use more able bodies like you around here - stop by another day if the operation hasn't wrapped up.</RewardText>
