  <Title>Stunning View</Title>
  <Description>Gargoyles make effective scouts and can be deadly if left to rain attacks from the air, but they have a very obvious weakness. Most of them have to go through long periods resting as stone to maintain the energy they need to carry their heavy bodies through the air.$B$BAs I peered through the eye you were using, I noticed dozens of iceskin sentries resting on the eastern and southern walls inside. Use the stalker to leap up to their ledges and devastate them while they sleep.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Vereth the Cunning at the Rise of Suffering wants you to use a Lithe Stalker's heave ability to destroy 12 sleeping Iceskin Sentries.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Almost too easy.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Not so much of a threat when they're sleeping.</RewardText>
