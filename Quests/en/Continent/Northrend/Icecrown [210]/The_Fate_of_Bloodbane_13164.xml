Under Icecrown Citadel itself, there is an immense pit - you will find Orbaz just outside its lip.$B$BSome of the Ebon Blade's strongest agents have already been dispatched - gather aid and join the fight. It is time for Bloodbane to die.</Description>

  <CompletionText>Are we finally free of that wretched Arthas want-to-be?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Mograine himself arrived to see the deed done then? I imagine there was some ill blood between those two - no surprise that he wanted a piece of the wretch.$B$BYou've done exceedingly well, $r, and you shall be awarded appropriately. The Ebon Blade thanks you.</RewardText>
