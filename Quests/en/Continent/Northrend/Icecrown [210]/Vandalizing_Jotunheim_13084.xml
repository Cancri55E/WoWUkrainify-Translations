  <Title>Vandalizing Jotunheim</Title>
  <Description>Let us see if we can further weaken the resolve of the vrykul, $n.$B$BEach day I wish you to travel to Jotunheim and put their banners to the torch. It may seem a trivial thing, but to see their ancestral home vandalized on a daily basis will demoralize them more than any physical punishment you can inflict.$B$BAt least... it can't hurt.</Description>

It is a place of significant importance to them, second only to Ymirheim.$B$BYou must keep up the pressure there while I hold the vault from the assault of the Lich King.</RewardText>
