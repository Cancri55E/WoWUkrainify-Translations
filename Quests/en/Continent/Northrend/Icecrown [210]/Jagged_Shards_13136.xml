  <Title>Jagged Shards</Title>
  <Description>You pulled this jagged, dark brittle shard from the body of a ghoul. The metal blade lacks a smooth edge, suggesting it was forged by an unskilled hand, or was broken from a larger piece.$B$BYou recall seeing similar shards embedded in the bodies of all the ghouls you've encountered at the Fleshwerks, leading you to wonder why their creators bothered to include the metal at all. Perhaps Crusader Olakin Sainrith would have some insight if you brought him the shards from several ghouls.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 10 Jagged Shards to Crusader Olakin Sainrith at Blackwatch.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What is that vile thing?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Olakin handles the shards of metal gingerly.&gt;$B$BYou saw these on all of the ghouls down there? I've never seen anything like this in all my battles against the Scourge.</RewardText>
