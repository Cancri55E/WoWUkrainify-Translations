  <Title>To the Rise with all Due Haste!</Title>

I would say that is foolish, but who am I to judge?$B$BDeath's Rise is far to the southwest, overlooking the sea along the cliff wall. There you will find Lord-Commander Arete personally overseeing the Onslaught's destruction himself.$B$B&lt;The baron clears his throat.&gt;$B$BDo see to it that you report to him with all due haste. He asked for you personally.</Description>
