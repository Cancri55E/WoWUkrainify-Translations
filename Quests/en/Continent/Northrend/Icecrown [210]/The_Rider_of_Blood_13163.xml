  <Title>The Rider of Blood</Title>
  <Description>Baelok is one of the few vrykul that I've ever seen rise through the ranks, and that was mostly accomplished through sheer brutality. If your competition ends up dead, there's far less to compete against.$B$BWhen you join battle with him, spread out from your companions and keep your distance as much as you reasonably can. He will not hesitate to steal your life force for himself, so you will need to hinder his ability to do so as much as possible.$B$BYou have my confidence. See to it that he dies.</Description>
