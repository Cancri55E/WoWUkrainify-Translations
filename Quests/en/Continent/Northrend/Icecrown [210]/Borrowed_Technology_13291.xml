  <Title>Borrowed Technology</Title>
  <Description>I get it, I get it. Cappy's too busy to see this for himself. His loss!$b$bSee, I've managed to 'acquire' a certain shipment of solution from the enemy. And as much as I hate tinkerin' with inferior goblin technology, I'm inclined to make an exception here.$b$bTake this sample. I'll need you to run a few field tests, just to prove its usefulness, while I try to do a little reverse engineering to duplicate the creation process.$b$bGo to the front and gather the materials to make a decoy, then use the oil.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Chief Engineer Boltwrench aboard the Skybreaker wants you to use the Smuggled Solution at the Broken Front.$b$bUsing the solution will require an Abandoned Helm, Abandoned Armor, and Pile of Bones, all found at the Broken Front.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Well, how'd it go, $r?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good news!$b$bI've managed to reproduce the solution - hardly an accomplishment, of course.$b$bDoubt I'll live to see the day those neanderthal goblins cook up somethin' a gnome can't recreate in his sleep!</RewardText>
