  <Title>Return To Myralion Sunblaze</Title>
  <Description>We must get this book to Myralion Sunblade. Would you bring it to him? I cannot rely on anyone else to transport the book and you have proven adept at evading the Silver Covenant's men.$B$BTake it with you to Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds in Icecrown. Myralion will be waiting for you. If he can identify that blade, we may be able to claim it in the name of Aethas Sunreaver and show Dalaran and the Alliance that we will lead the charge against the Lich King.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring Ancient Dragonforged Blades to Myralion Sunblaze at Quel'Delar's Rest.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We've been expecting your return. What has kept you?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Myralion accepts the heavy book and begins leafing through it.&gt;$B$BThose symbols on the blade seemed familiar and now there's little wonder why. This is certainly a dragon blade, gifted to one of the mortal races, but which blade is this, and how did it come to rest in Icecrown?</RewardText>
