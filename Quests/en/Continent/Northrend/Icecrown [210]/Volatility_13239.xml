  <Title>Volatility</Title>
  <Description>Where to begin... well, you must know that as chief engineer of this vessel I have access to all of the intelligence reports - yes, yes, it's true, and I've recently taken a particular interest in the frostwyrms you reported seeing to the south, and I do believe I've developed a plan that just might work against them... now it'll take a little legwork on your part, but essentially, you build a dummy out of armor and coat it with a splash of this solution, then run for cover!$b$b...You still here, $r?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Chief Engineer Copperclaw wants you to use Copperclaw's Volatile Oil at the Broken Front to attract 3 Frostbrood Skytalons.$b$bTo use the oil, you must collect a Pile of Bones, an Abandoned Helm, and Abandoned Armor from the battlefield there.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How'd it work? Did you try it? Did you do it like I told ya?$b$bWell? Did ya?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Wahooo! I saw them light up all the way from here! I'll just chalk that up as another success and begin bottling this stuff up for the invasion - of course it might need a little more testing as we go if you're at all interested....</RewardText>
