  <Title>Tirion's Help</Title>
  <Description>It's not the first time I've heard that story about Arthas and his heart... always thought it was some made-up tale to impress the rank and file.$B$BWe must act on this information immediately.  Unfortunately, we must do so in secret.$B$BArthas's agents are everywhere and if he finds out, our plan is dead in the water.$B$BWe need to take this to the Argent Crusade.  Every single paladin in that order was hand-picked by Tirion himself.  If there's anyone free of cultist infiltration, it's those guys.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Highlord Tirion Fordring at the Crusader's Pinnacle.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Heavy words, $n.  If it were somebody else saying them, I'd be likely to judge them insane.</RewardText>
