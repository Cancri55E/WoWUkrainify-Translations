  <Title>An Audience With The Arcanist</Title>
  <Description>I've placed an enchantment on the tabard that should allow you to slip past the Silver Enclave's defenses for a short period of time. You should have enough time to find your way up to the top level of the Silver Enclave and meet up with the Silver Covenant's man there, known as Arcanist Tybalin.$B$BWhile disguised, obtain the copy of Ancient Dragonforged Blades that his men borrowed from Wyrmrest, and return the book to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve the Ancient Dragonforged Blades tome from Arcanist Tybalin.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you recover the book from Wyrmrest?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent work. Now that this is in our hands, we must get it to Myralion Sunblaze as soon as possible. We can't risk the Silver Covenant taking the book from us again.$B$BI'll get that tabard back to Shandy and see that he's well compensated for his assistance. Once the book is in Myralion's hands, the Silver Covenant won't be a threat anymore.</RewardText>
