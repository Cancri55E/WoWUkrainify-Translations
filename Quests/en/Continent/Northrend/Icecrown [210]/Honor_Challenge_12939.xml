Let's demoralize them with the 'mere' skills of a $r, shall we?$B$B&lt;The duke grins, his rotting teeth flashing in the dim light of the vault.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Duke Lankral at The Shadow Vault has asked you to use the Challenge Flag to challenge and defeat 6 Mjordin Combatants.</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>Already I'm hearing reports of the prowess you displayed on the Savage Ledge. Excellent, $n... excellent!$B$B&lt;The duke flashes his rictus smile again and you can almost hear the wheels in his head turning.&gt;$B$BAnd now I think it's time to issue a decree to the thane of those vrykul that you so easily defeated.</RewardText>
