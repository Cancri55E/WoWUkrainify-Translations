  <Title>New Recruit</Title>
  <Description>First things first. I saw some Lithe Stalkers on the ramparts just east of us. They used to serve us before we broke with Arthas, and they're about as perfect a scout as you can get... with a little prodding from an eye of dominion.$B$BFly up, find one of the stalkers, beat it down a bit, and then use this Sigil of the Ebon Blade to command its obedience. It will recognize the sigil, guaranteed. Lead it back to the top of the rocks northeast of here and it will find its way to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Vereth the Cunning on the Rise of Suffering has requested that you bring a subdued Lithe Stalker to the top of the rocks northeast of the Rise of Suffering.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I'm sure their new masters don't go easy on them, but there's no way these things would forget the lessons we lashed into their skins. They'll fear those sigils for as long as they crawl this land.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I've chained the wretch to the post over there and I'll look into getting my hands on more of them.$B$BNow let's make some use of that eye.</RewardText>
