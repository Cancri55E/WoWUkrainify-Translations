  <Title>Monitoring the Rift: Cleftcliff Anomaly</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, $r. I am Garren of Dalaran.$b$bNot long ago, the rift was a peaceful place - geothermally speaking at least.$b$bRecently though, earthquakes have occurred with alarming frequency and scars in the earth have appeared, exposing unique energy fields of chaotic power.$b$bMy mission here is to chart and monitor these anomalies. My instruments indicate that another has appeared on the cliff face to the southwest.$b$bTake this device with you and use it when you locate the new disruption.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Garren on Amber Ledge wants you to use the Arcanometer at the Cleftcliff Anomaly.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you taken the readings I requested, $c?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Fascinating! This is the largest disruption yet.$b$bThough the worst is yet to come, I fear.</RewardText>
