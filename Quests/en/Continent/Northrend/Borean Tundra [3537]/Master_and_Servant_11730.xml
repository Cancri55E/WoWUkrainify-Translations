  <Description>The Ultrasonic Screwdriver is the ultimate tool. It can do anything to mechanical stuff!$B$BHead back into the pools and dismantle a number of Mechazod's robots. Then all you have to do is use the screwdriver on their remains, and I'm betting that they'll turn to our side, for a short time anyway.$B$BI'm pretty sure it won't work on the mechagnomes, so don't even bother with them.$B$BOh, and if you want to take anything from the robot's insides, you'll want to do so before using the screwdriver!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Ultrasonic Screwdriver to reprogram 15 robots and then return to Crafty Wobblesprocket at Fizzcrank Airstrip.$B$BMake sure to loot the dead robot before you reprogram it.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>How many robots have you managed to reprogram?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Woo hoo! And you brought back the screwdriver intact, too!$B$BReprogramming those robots is going to turn out to be a huge advantage in our favor in the fight against Gearmaster Mechazod. I think you've earned a little something for that.</RewardText>
