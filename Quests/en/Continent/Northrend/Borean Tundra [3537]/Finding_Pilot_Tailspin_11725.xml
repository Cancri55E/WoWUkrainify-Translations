  <LogDescription>Locate Iggy "Tailspin" Cogtoggle in the Geyser Fields.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank goodness. It was terrible.$B$BThere was a bright flash on the ground, and then, the next thing I know, the squadron's going down! I'm hurt pretty badly, so I haven't had a chance to comb the site for other survivors, but something tells me I don't think there will be many.$B$B&lt;Iggy grimaces in pain.&gt;$B$BWill you help me complete my mission?</RewardText>
