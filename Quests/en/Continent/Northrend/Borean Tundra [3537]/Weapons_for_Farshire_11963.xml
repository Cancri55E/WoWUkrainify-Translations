  <Title>Weapons for Farshire</Title>
  <Description>Farshire is overrun and all that Gerald can think of is to get me my ore shipment?  I swear that man has as much heart as any of our soldiers on the frontlines.$B$BWe cannot let the civilians lose their lands if they're willing to fight for them.  We might not have the troops to spare, but we can send them weapons.$B$BThese were earmarked for new recruits, but I'll be able to cover those with the ore you've brought me.  Send word to Gerald that weapons are on the way.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Gerald Green in Farshire.</LogDescription>
