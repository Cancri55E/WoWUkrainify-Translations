  <Title>The Collapse</Title>
  <Description>I have created and bound Alluvius using the Horn of Elemental Fury. He will respond to the horn's call when you stand near the southernmost sinkhole in the Geyser Fields.$B$BThe quake Alluvius will unleash should collapse the Nerubian tunnels and put an end to their flanking attack. I wouldn't be surprised if the Nerubian commander showed himself after the quake. If the collapse of the tunnels doesn't break the back of their assault, the defeat of their leader surely will.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wind Tamer Barah at Taunka'le Village wants you to collapse the Nerubian sinkholes using the Horn of Elemental Fury and defeat Lord Kryxix.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you unleashed Alluvius and destroyed the Nerubian assault?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Your efforts against the Nerubians have given us a reprieve from the overwhelming Scourge assault. Thanks to your accomplishments, we can strike at the Scourge fortress to the northeast without fear of attack from the west.$B$BAs for the horn, I will safeguard it until next we need its power. Stormhoof gave his life to secure the horn and we cannot suffer its loss again.</RewardText>
