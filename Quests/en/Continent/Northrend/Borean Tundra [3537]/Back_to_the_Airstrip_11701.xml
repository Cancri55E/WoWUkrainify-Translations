  <Title>Back to the Airstrip</Title>
  <Description>Okay, I think I'm going to start making my way back to the airstrip, too. Of course, I'm moving a little slower with this leg injury.$B$BSay, do you think you could get there ahead of me and pass on the good news to Ol' Fizzcrank? I bet anything that there'll be a reward in it for you.$B$BThanks, $n!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Fizzcrank Fullthrottle at Fizzcrank Airstrip in Borean Tundra.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That's quite a tale, $n. With all of the problems out here, it's a wonder that the airstrip hasn't been wiped out already.$B$BBut, thanks to you, there's one less adversary to worry about.$B$BI put aside some special things for just such an occasion as this. Why don't you take your pick?</RewardText>
