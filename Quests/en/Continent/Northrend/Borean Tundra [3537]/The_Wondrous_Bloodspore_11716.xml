  <Title>The Wondrous Bloodspore</Title>
  <Description>We are witnessing something amazing here, $r. A whole undiscovered ecology lives and breathes not more than a few paces from us! I surmise it is the bloodspore plant that sets this environment abuzz.$B$BI have collected some pollen from the nearby male species of bloodspore plant but still lack female receptors for pollination. Fetch me a bushel of the bloodspore carpels. You'll find them near the larger plants surrounding us.$B$BBe wary of their guardians! The kobolds won't give them up easily!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bloodmage Laurith at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra wants you to recover 10 Bloodspore Carpels.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>The tests must continue!</CompletionText>
