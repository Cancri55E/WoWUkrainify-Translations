Inside that mine there's a cart with the last of the ore the Alliance is going to see on this side of the continent for a long time.$B$BThe problem is the cart release is locked.  When the military went in there, Captain Jacobs commandeered all the important equipment, including the cart release key.$B$BThe plague that affected the soldiers in the mine must also have affected Jacobs.  Get the key from him and salvage the ore.</Description>
