  <Title>There's Something Going On In Those Caves</Title>
  <Description>So, while you were out taking care of those plagued beasts, I took a peek inside the caves up there.$B$BThere are cultists in there plaguing them!$B$BThey have some sort of noxious concoction brewing in a cauldron. I have a powder that I normally use as an anti-poison, and I mixed it up with some other stuff. I think it'll neutralize their brew!$B$BTake it up to one of those caves and see if it works.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bixie Wrenchshanker, skulking just to the south of The Dens of Dying, has asked you to use Bixie's Inhibiting Powder at a Den of Dying Plague Cauldron to neutralize it.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Time's wasting, $c. The last thing we need is to have to face plagued magnataur.$B$BThe normal ones are bad enough as it is!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I knew you had it in you. Now there's something else that I need to ask you to take care of.</RewardText>
