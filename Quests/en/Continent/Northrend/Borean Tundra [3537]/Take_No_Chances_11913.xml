  <Title>Take No Chances</Title>
  <Description>I heard what you told Gerald and I don't like it one bit.  If cultists managed to poison the grain in the mines with their foul plague, they could've easily done the same with the grain outside.$B$BWe don't have time to sort the good grain from the bad.  We must act quickly and burn it all.$B$BTake this torch and set fire to any sacks of grain you find out here.  It would be a tragedy if we survived this attack only to succumb to the plague afterwards.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wendy Darren wants you to use Wendy's Torch to burn 8 sacks of Farshire Grain.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you done what I asked of you, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I thank you, $n.  I would hate to see survivors of the attack on Farshire stumble upon plagued grain.</RewardText>
