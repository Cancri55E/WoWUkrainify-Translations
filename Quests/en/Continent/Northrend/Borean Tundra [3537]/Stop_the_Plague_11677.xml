  <Description>I'm convinced that the plague is being caused by something in the caves up there.$B$B$C, I want you to take these seeds. I normally use them as a ward against the Scourge, though perhaps they can be used to disrupt whatever foulness is happening in the dens.$B$BFind the source of the plague and throw them into it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Sage Highmesa, standing just south of The Dens of Dying, has asked you to use Highmesa's Cleansing Seeds at a Den of Dying Plague Cauldron to neutralize it.</LogDescription>
