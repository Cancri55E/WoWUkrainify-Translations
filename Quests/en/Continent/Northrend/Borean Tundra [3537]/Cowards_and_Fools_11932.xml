  <Title>Cowards and Fools</Title>
  <Description>Listen, $n.  No offense, but the operation they put Thassarian in charge of was pure suicide.$B$BA handful of our men were to launch an attack on the biggest Scourge presence in the area.  Call me crazy, but storming a Scourge ziggurat outside a plagued Nerubian city with a dozen men ain't my idea of fun.$B$BIf you're still interested in finding Thassarian, we were supposed to arrange for passage east with a tuskarr by the name of Ataika in Kaskala to the northeast.  Good luck with your fool's errand.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Ataika in Kaskala, northeast of Valiance Keep.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I remember the man you speak of.  He bore the marks of Karkut.$B$BMay Karkut protect our fallen.</RewardText>
