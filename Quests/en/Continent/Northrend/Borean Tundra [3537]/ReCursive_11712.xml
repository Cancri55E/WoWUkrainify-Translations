  <Title>Re-Cursive</Title>
  <Description>If you listened to the old man, then you know that we have gnomes out there that were changed. Gearmaster Mechazod infected them with something that reversed the "Curse of the Flesh", and now they're robots!$B$BWe think we have a way to re-curse them back to normal. We want you to take this re-cursive transmatter injection and use it on the corpses of any mechagnomes you come across.$B$BWe're hoping that this stuff will cure them and allow us to lock onto them to port 'em out of there.$B$BWhaddya say, $n?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Jinky Wingnut at Fizzcrank Airstrip has asked you to use the Re-Cursive Transmatter Injection on 6 Fizzcrank Mechagnomes.</LogDescription>
