  <Title>Pollen from the Source</Title>
  <Description>It's obvious! The bloodspore moths are the entities responsible for pollination on these plains. It must be something that happens within the moth's internal system that acts as a catalyst for this pollen to work. It's all starting to make sense now, $n. That's why the kobolds don't kill the moths and instead go to great lengths to protect them! Those stupid little rats have it all figured out!$B$BWell we'll just have to get our own moth pollen! What do you say? Fetch me some in the name of science?</Description>
