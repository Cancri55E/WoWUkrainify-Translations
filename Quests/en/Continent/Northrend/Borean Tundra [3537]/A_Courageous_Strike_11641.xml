  <Title>A Courageous Strike</Title>
  <Description>From the beginning, I've counseled that Chieftain Wintergale should assemble our mighty warriors and attack our enemy at their base. My advice has fallen on deaf ears and he has proven that he'd rather tip-toe around according to Sage Aeire's plans.$B$BI'll wait no longer. If Chieftain Wintergale is too cowardly to send our warriors into battle, perhaps you'd be willing to show him that a direct attack can succeed. Storm the Temple City of En'kilah and slay all in your path, $n.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Slay 15 En'kilah Ghouls and 5 En'kilah Necromancers and report back to Durm Icehide at Taunka'le Village.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Don't bother me unless you've come to report a successful mission.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You have proven your fearlessness and demonstrated your prowess in combat. I believe you would make a fine taunka warrior. I only wish the chieftain had the same understanding.$B$BWe are fortunate to count you as an ally in our struggle to evacuate the village before it is overrun by the Scourge.</RewardText>
