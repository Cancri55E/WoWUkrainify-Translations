  <Title>The Invasion of Gammoth</Title>
  <Description>Hellscream assigned Mighthorn and I with the daunting task of magnataur extermination on the southern front of Warsong Hold. With us came an entire platoon of seasoned Horde soldiers. Our initial foray into the nearby magnataur dens proved quite unsuccessful as our entire squad was wiped out by the lair defenders. We're the only ones left...$B$BWe aren't scientists or researchers. We're soldiers of the Horde, just like you. Soldiers on a mission that cannot fail...$B$BSpeak to Primal Mighthorn now.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Primal Mighthorn at the Bloodspore Plains in the Borean Tundra.
