  <Title>Magic Carpet Ride</Title>
  <Description>Tanks, mon. I be talkin' bout siege machines! We got heavy tanks stationed at Garrosh's Landing on da west coast. We gonna get you to da tank and you gonna use da tank to lay down some Horde justice on da Scourge!$B$BDa only tricky part be getting' you der. No way we be sendin' you on our wind riders. Too risky.$B$BYou see dat pixie o'er der? Dat blondie elf? Yanni be his name, mon. He can get you to da coast, safely. Once der, talk to Annihilator Grek'lor!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Talk to Yanni at Warsong Hold to arrange safe travel to the coast. Speak to Annihilator Grek'lor once you arrive at Garrosh's Landing.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>NO MERCY FOR THE DEAD!$B$BNone of 'em had the guts to stay behind to defend our glorious tanks after Hellscream deemed the coast 'condemned.' It's mostly quiet here, seein' as how the Scourge are formin' up ranks to assault Warsong Hold. Sometimes I get a stray zombie or ghoul, but they don't last very long.$B$B&lt;Gorge strokes his axe.&gt;$B$B'Course, there's the mist...$B$B&lt;Gorge shudders.&gt;
