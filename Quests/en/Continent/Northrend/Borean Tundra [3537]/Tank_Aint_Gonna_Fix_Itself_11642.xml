  <Title>Tank Ain't Gonna Fix Itself</Title>
  <Description>We need to get these tanks back up and runnin'! They ain't gonna fix themselves. Mobu's gonna be the one to handle that stuff. Talk to him and see what he needs. Maybe you can shut him up before he finally drives me into a berserker frenzy and I cleave him in two!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Mobu at Garrosh's Landing.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You're the new tank driver, buddy? Fine by me! We just need to get these things up and running again. Yea, you try to go out into the Plains of Nasam without a tank and you're as good as dead.</RewardText>
