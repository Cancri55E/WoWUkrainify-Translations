  <Title>Taken by the Scourge</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Mortuus sighs.&gt;$B$BPeons... We may as well post up a sign offering the Nerub'ar a free meal.$B$BSee, the problem with a peon is that: (1) they're dumber than dirt; and (2) they're weaker than a leper gnome. Of course they're the first to be taken by the Scourge!$B$BThis puts me in a bit of a predicament, you see. Without peons, manual labor comes to a halt. No peons, no construction.$B$BFind and release my peons, $r. If they're alive, you'll find 'em spun up in webbing throughout Mightstone Quarry.

  <CompletionText>No peons, no buildings. And no, we're not going to replace them with goblins. Too damned expensive...
</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Most of them made it back. The ones smart enough to know that we're inside the gigantic metal and stone building, anyway...$B$BRegardless, a job well done. I hear you sprung more than a couple peons loose.$B$BOh yes, you're the talk of the... um... fortress.</RewardText>
