  <Description>I was in charge of the harvest golems - an important job until the Scourge destroyed most of our farmlands.  I've an idea that would make the golems useful again, however.$B$BI think I can rewire the harvest collectors so they'll give us a hand fighting the Scourge.$B$BI'm not an expert at this just yet, so I'm going to need my manual.  The problem is, I left it at the workshop... which happens to be that burning building next to the mine.  Think you could go salvage it?</Description>
