  <Title>Weakness to Lightning</Title>
  <Description>You now have the power of the storm within you. I will give you the means to focus that power and weaken the robots in the pools.$B$BTake this lightning rod. Use it against the robotic creations of the mechagnomes you find within the greater pools area to the west. Do not worry about using it against the mechagnomes themselves; Greatmother Taiga has other plans for them.$B$BOnce the robots are weakened by the power of the storm, dismantle them utterly!</Description>
  <LogDescription>While weakened by the Power of the Storm, destroy any 15 of the robotic units, except the mechagnomes, in the greater pools area surrounding the Fizzcrank Pumping Station.$B$BAfterward, return to Sage Earth and Sky at Taunka'le Village.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you unleashed the power of the storm upon those unnatural creations?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>With their robotic minions dealt with, it is time for us to move on to bigger prey. Unfortunately, even now I feel the power of the storm waning from within you.$B$BNevertheless, it served its purpose, and I think that you're more than capable of taking the next step without it.</RewardText>
