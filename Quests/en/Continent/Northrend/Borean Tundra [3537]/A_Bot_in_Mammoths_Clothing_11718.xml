  <Title>A Bot in Mammoth's Clothing</Title>
  <Description>I've reconfigured the skeleton of an old bot to create an earthquake large enough to collapse the tunnels, but the machinery is delicate and sensitive to Northrend's biting cold.$B$BI've devised a means of insulating it using the thickest hides of the native mammoths. They roam the plains south of the airstrip and adjacent to the Geyser Fields. Bring back enough of the hides for me to finish the machine and then we'll be able to unleash it on the Nerubians!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Abner Fizzletorque at Fizzcrank Airstrip wants you to bring him 6 Thick Mammoth Hides.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Bring those hides as quickly as possible! I won't be able to finish the machine without them!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Abner inspects the hides, coughing at all the dust rising from them.&gt;$B$BDon't these animals even try to keep clean? Some of these are absolutely filthy. Well, I guess I'd better get started cleaning them. It's not like anyone's got spare time around here.</RewardText>
