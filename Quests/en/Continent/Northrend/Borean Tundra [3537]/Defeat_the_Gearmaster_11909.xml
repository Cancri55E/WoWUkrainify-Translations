  <Description>Clearly this Gearmaster Mechazod creature is not in his right mind. If his offer of a cure and immortality means all of us becoming robotic slaves then he must be stopped!$B$BThe winds that guide me whisper that he's atop the pumping station out in the middle of the pools to the west.$B$BMost likely, he'll be found in the command hut on top of the structure. Go inside and research his works.$B$B$n, you must confront Mechazod if we are to survive!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Research the Gearmaster's Manual and return Mechazod's Head to Greatmother Taiga at Taunka'le Village.</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>&lt;The greatmother breathes a heavy sigh of relief.&gt;$B$BIt is done then... you have saved us! If you hadn't stopped him here, then who knows how far this mistake of the gnomes would have spread?$B$BWith the threats from the blue dragons and the Nexus War, not to mention the Lich King, the last thing we need is a mad creation of the Titans running loose!$B$BThank you, $n.</RewardText>
