  <Title>What's the Matter with the Transmatter?</Title>
  <Description>There're spare parts strewn all over to the east in the Scalding Pools, the Geyser Fields... heck, probably even up on the pumping station still, too. Bring back a whole bunch. Maybe then I'll be able to get outgoing teleport on this thing working, not to mention getting the incoming transmatter ports aligned.$B$BI'd hate to see another accident....</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect 15 Fizzcrank Spare Parts and deliver them to Mordle Cogspinner at Fizzcrank Airstrip.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It's going to take a lot of spare parts to keep this thing running.$B$BPlease tell me that you've returned with everything we need.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>That's great, $c! These parts look like they're in serviceable condition.$B$BNow if I could only figure out how to fix this blasted thing....</RewardText>
