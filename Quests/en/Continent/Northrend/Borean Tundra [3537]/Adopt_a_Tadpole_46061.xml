  <Title>Adopt a Tadpole</Title>
  <Description>One day every year, usually in mid-spring, the Winterfin tadpoles are given free reign of the village. I'm not sure why this tradition persists, as it usually results in heavy damage to the their buildings and food stores.$b$bI usually try not to interfere too much with the goings-on of the tribe, but today, I take exception. Go out and see if you can keep an eye on one of the tadpoles.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Select your favorite Winterfin tadpole and beckon it to follow you.</LogDescription>
