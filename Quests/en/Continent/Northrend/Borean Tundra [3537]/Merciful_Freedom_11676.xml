Through some thievery we've managed to find a few keys, but we're unable to get close enough to any prisoners without being attacked.$B$BWe need your "talents" in securing those keys and freeing the prisoners. Bash in the brains of the necrolords and aberrations and take their keys. Use those keys to free Scourge prisoners.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Shadowstalker Canarius at Warsong Farms Outpost wants you to free 5 Scourge Prisoners.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Save those prisoners!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Each prisoner saved is one less undead aberration that we have to deal with, $n. You've done a great service for the Horde.</RewardText>
