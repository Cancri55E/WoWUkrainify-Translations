  <Title>Give Fizzcrank the News</Title>
  <Description>Would you be willing to head back to the airstrip and let Fizzcrank know that I'll be along shortly to give my formal report? I've got to deal with the wreckage of my flying machine, and then I'll be on my way.$B$BI'll be certain that Fizzcrank knows that he has you to thank for my survival and the recovery effort.$B$BI only wonder what the old man would've done himself if he'd been flying with us. I miss those days.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Make your way back to Fizzcrank Airstrip and speak with Fizzcrank Fullthrottle.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Fizzcrank listens to your report, looking somewhat relieved.&gt;$B$BI should've gone with them. We might've been able to complete the mission without losing any pilots.$B$BTailspin is right, though, we have you to thank for what you've been able to salvage. Your efforts may just make the difference in the fight against the Nerubians.</RewardText>
