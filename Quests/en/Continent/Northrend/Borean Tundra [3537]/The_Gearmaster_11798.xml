  <Description>Gearmaster Mechazod is insane! He says that he offers us immortality by removing this so-called 'Curse of the Flesh', but what he's really making are robotic slaves!$B$B$n, we're pretty certain that he's still at the pumping station out in the middle of the pools to the east.$B$BThe last we saw of him, he was in the command hut up top. Go up there and research his stuff.$B$BYou must confront Mechazod if gnomes everywhere,... no, everyone everywhere, are to stay alive!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Research the Gearmaster's Manual and return Mechazod's Head to Fizzcrank Fullthrottle.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Jinky told me to expect you.  Is it done?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;The old gnome breathes a heavy sigh of relief.&gt;$B$BIt is done then... you have saved us! If you hadn't stopped him here, then who knows how far his madness would have spread?$B$BWith the threats from the blue dragons and the Nexus War, not to mention the Lich King, the last thing we need is a mad creation of the Titans running loose!$B$BThank you, $n!</RewardText>
