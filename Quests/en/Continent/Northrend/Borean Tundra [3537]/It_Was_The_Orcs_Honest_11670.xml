  <Title>It Was The Orcs, Honest!</Title>
  <Description>With all of those outfits you, er, recovered, I fashioned a Warsong orc disguise. I had the genius idea of combining it with some old stuff that I had left hanging around from last Hallows' End, so it should be foolproof!$B$BHere, in this sack is the disguise and the banner you recovered. Head down into the bowels of Magmoth and slay the magnataur chieftain, Magmothregar.$B$BIf you're going to convince them to turn their attention on the Warsong orcs, you'll need to plant the banner while disguised.</Description>
  <LogDescription>While disguised as a Warsong orc, plant the Warsong Banner in the corpse of Magmothregar. Then, return with the disguise to Crafty Wobblesprocket at Fizzcrank Airstrip.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It's all over then? You've done the dirty deed and framed the orcs at Bor'gorok Outpost?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Holey moley, you did it!$B$BAlright, now those pesky magnataur and their snobold flunkies should turn their attentions on the Horde.$B$BHow can I ever repay you, $n?</RewardText>
