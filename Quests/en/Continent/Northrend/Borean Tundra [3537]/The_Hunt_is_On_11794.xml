  <Title>The Hunt is On</Title>
  <Description>I've made it my business to learn as much as possible about the vile death cult, including their secret language.$B$BVurenn was right.  The cultists mention disguised operatives in various locations in Valiance Keep: the lower docks, the jail inside the inner hold and in the inn's kitchen.$B$BTake this oculus.  Use it at those three locations - anyone that has recently used the cult's necromancy will be enshrouded by a dark aura.  Take care of the cultists before something nefarious happens.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Vindicator Yaala wants you to use the Oculus of the Exorcist in three different locations in Valiance Keep to uncover and defeat Cult of the Damned members.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you accomplished the task I asked of you, $n?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You've done well, $n.  However, I can't shake the feeling that this is not the last we've seen of these death cultists.$B$BDarkness has a way of hiding even in plain sight.</RewardText>
