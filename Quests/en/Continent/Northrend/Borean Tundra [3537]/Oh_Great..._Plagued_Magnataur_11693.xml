  <Title>Oh Great... Plagued Magnataur!</Title>
  <Description>Tinky and I came out here stalking some old magnataur. Apparently those caves up there are where they go to die.$B$BOf course, we had no idea that they were going to get plagued when they went in there. We can't have plagued things just roaming about; it's not healthy.$B$BSay, why don't you put down a number of those things while I figure out what our next step should be?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Plagued Magnataur and then return to Bixie Wrenchshanker to the south of The Dens of Dying.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Doesn't look like enough of the plagued magnataur have been put down yet, $c.$B$BThink you could take care of a few more before coming back?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Nice work, but I'd grab a shower the next chance you get.$B$BNow, let's really deal with the problem out here.</RewardText>
