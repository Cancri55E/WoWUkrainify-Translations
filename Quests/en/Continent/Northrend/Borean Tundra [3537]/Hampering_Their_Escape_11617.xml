They're the transportation the mage hunters used to land their forces here, and now they're loading them up with our artifacts and fragments of our statues.$B$BWe must stop them before they leave the quarry.$B$BThe small creatures digging in the quarry carry explosives. Take them and use them to destroy the three floating platforms. The leader keeps watch from a fourth, grounded platform, but we'll deal with him afterward.</Description>
