  <Title>Plug the Sinkholes</Title>
  <Description>The Scourge are showing no sign of letting up, $n.  It's those blasted sinkholes; they connect to tunnels all the way to Icecrown for all we know.  Giant undead worms burrow under the ground to create them.$B$BIf there's something years of mining has taught me it's that without support beams, tunnels will cave in easily after an explosion.$B$BTake these explosives and place them at the entrance to the sinkholes up on the ridge beyond the beach to the west.  Come back after you've collapsed them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Sergeant Hammerhill wants you to use the Incendiary Explosives to collapse the sinkholes southwest and northwest of Valiance Keep.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you succeed, $n?  We need to slow down the Scourge or Valiance Keep will be overrun.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent work, $n.  Without you, Valiance Keep might've not held against the attackers.  Thanks to your help we'll live to fight another day.</RewardText>
