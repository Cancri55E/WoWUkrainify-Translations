  <Title>Tanks a lot...</Title>
  <Description>Thanks for all your help, buddy. You can let Grek'lor know the tanks are ready for action. Hopefully you can clean up this place once and for all!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Annihilator Grek'lor at the Coast of Echoes.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>With the current state of our transports and shipping lanes, we haven't been able to get a damned siege engine to Warsong. These tanks are all that we have left from the original expedition. Now that they're operational, you're gonna use 'em to stomp the Scourge offensive at the Plains of Nasam.</RewardText>
