  <Title>When All Else Fails</Title>
  <Description>So...  so I don't think we're going to be getting a good foothold in those mountains.$B$BTrust me, I'm not one to give up easily... but between freezing engines, nasty vrykul women, territorial dragon want-to-bes and the half a dozen other nasties settled in the area, this just ain't happening.$B$BDon't let that dissuade you though! Just because we can't get a foothold doesn't mean we won't get you there... one-way trips are pretty simple when you get down to it.$B$B&lt;Ricket nods at some nearby rockets.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Ricket to make use of Ricket's D16 Propelled Delivery Device to enter further into Storm Peaks.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Olut winces.&gt;$B$BThat looked painful. It was a pretty grand entrance though.$B$BAre you here to help us find a path into Icecrown? As you can see, our first foray in that direction didn't end too admirably. I'm thinking we might be better off breaching the place from another side.</RewardText>
