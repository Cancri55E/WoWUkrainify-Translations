  <Title>Baby Stealers</Title>
  <Description>A few weeks ago, if you looked up, you'd see dozens of those beautiful eagles soaring the skies. Now, only a few if any. They've taken to staying with their nests nearly all the time now because the harpies have been stealing their eggs.$B$BThe harpies have grown a taste for eagle flesh, it seems... the sick wretches are caring for the eggs long enough to feast on the hatchlings. Go into the valleys to the north or the east and find the eggs... bring them back here, and I'll take them back to the nests.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Fjorlin Frostbrow at Frosthold would like you to bring back 15 Stormcrest Eagle Eggs.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>We'll get this harpy problem taken care of... the eagles will be free to soar the skies again soon.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Good stuff, $G lad:lass;. You're making fast friends.$B$BIf you stop back by soon, I'm sure we can find one that will let you ride... they should know that you're trustworthy now.</RewardText>
