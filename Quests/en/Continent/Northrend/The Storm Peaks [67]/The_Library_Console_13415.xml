  <Title>The Library Console</Title>
  <Description>Norgannon's shell is within our reach, $n. Take the inventor's disk into the library's interior. There should be a console there that you can activate with the disk. I imagine Mimir stored more there than just Norgannon's shell. There are probably enough schematics stored there to keep Ironforge's engineers occupied for years!$B$BAnyway, use the disk to recover the shell. Hopefully, Mimir hasn't decided to put any more obstacles in our way. </Description>
