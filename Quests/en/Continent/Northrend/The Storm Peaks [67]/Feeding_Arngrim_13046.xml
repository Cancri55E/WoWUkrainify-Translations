  <Title>Feeding Arngrim</Title>
  <Description>Arngrim's hunger was legendary.$b$bEven in death, his expression is one of famished yearning. You find that just looking at him is making your stomach growl.$b$bIt is said that throughout his life he was never truly sated, and that there was absolutely nothing he wouldn't eat. You wonder to yourself if there might be a way to feed the old king.$b$bNo sooner does the thought enter your mind than one of the massive frozen teeth falls from Arngrim's head, bounces off of his beard and lands in your hand.</Description>
  <LogDescription>You are to feed Arngrim 5 Disembodied Jormungar, then return to Arngrim's frozen image in Dun Niffelem.$b$bYou must go to the Valley of Ancient Winters and use Arngrim's Tooth on the Roaming Jormungar there. Once they have become disembodied, you must fight them until they are weakened.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>As you anchor the tooth in Arngrim's jaw, you get the impression that your efforts may have taken the edge off of the old king's hunger pangs... for now.</RewardText>
