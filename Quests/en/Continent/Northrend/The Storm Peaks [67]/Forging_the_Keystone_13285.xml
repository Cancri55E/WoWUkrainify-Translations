  <Title>Forging the Keystone</Title>
  <Description>Aha! Here it is: the Temple of Invention, the seat of Keeper Mimir himself! Of course, that's where one would go to join the two parts of the key.$B$BAccording to the prospector's notes, the Temple of Invention is one of the highest points on the western side of the Terrace of the Makers. That means it should be roughly east of your Grom'arsh Crash Site.$B$BI'll meet you at the temple and we'll combine the parts together.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Brann Bronzebeard wants you to meet him at the Temple of Invention and help him combine Norgannon's Shell and Norgannon's Core. Once you have helped Brann, report back to Boktar Bloodfury at the Grom'arsh Crash-Site.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Boktar nods in approval as you tell him how you helped Brann recover the pieces of the keystone and combine them.&gt;$B$BBrann may prove to be just the ally we need to discover what is truly happening in Ulduar. You've done well in aiding him. We need all the help we can get against this Loken and his iron dwarf minions.</RewardText>
