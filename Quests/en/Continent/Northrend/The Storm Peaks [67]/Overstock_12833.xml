  <Description>Hey there again! You didn't run off like all the other adventurers did? Well, you're just a peach, aren't ya? I was beginning to think I smelled funny or something!$B$BWe could still use a bit of a hand around here, and you have just the right experience.  Remember those magnataur? Well apparently the cave didn't completely collapse... there are still quite a few left. So much for Gino taking care of them, eh?$B$BFortunately, Jeer made way more than enough mines. You've got this!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ricket at K3 wants you to use Improved Land Mines at Garm's Bane to fend off the attackers from Garm. Both Garm Invaders and Snowblind Followers will count towards this goal.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Boom! Ha ha!</CompletionText>
