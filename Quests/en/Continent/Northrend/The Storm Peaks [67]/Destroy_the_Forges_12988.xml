  <Title>Destroy the Forges!</Title>
  <Description>In my folly, I'd thought Valduran's project at Narvir's Cradle, a large construction area to the south, no more than a grotesque monument to "Keeper" Loken's cruelty.$B$BNow we know the truth, that it was meant to be used as a weapon against us and our allies. We must not allow this iron colossus to reach completion, $n, for it will mean the end of the refuge.$B$BGo to Narvir's Cradle, find the lightning forges the stormforged artisans use, and sabotage them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy the North Lightning Forge, the Central Lightning Forge, and the South Lightning Forge with Bouldercrag's Bombs, then return to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Were you able to hamper them by sabotaging the forges?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent work! Oh, it won't stop the iron dwarves, but it'll take them valuable time to rebuild those forges. I daresay we've gained the advantage.</RewardText>
