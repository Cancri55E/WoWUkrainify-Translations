  <Description>To the point... Ricket's asked me to put together some stronger land mines, but I'm running low on parts.$B$BJust west of town, you'll find the remains of our last rocket sled... Ricket got a little excited when she was fueling it, but I probably should have thought to not put the nozzle right over the exhaust. Live and learn, eh?$B$BThere should be a good stock of spare parts scattered around the destroyed sled... why don't you go ahead and chase off those scavengers and nab me some of that wreckage?</Description>
