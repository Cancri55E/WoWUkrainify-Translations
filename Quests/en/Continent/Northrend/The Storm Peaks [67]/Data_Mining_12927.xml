  <Title>Data Mining</Title>
  <Description>That disk you assembled... it's blank! Keeper Mimir, the tinker who built this library, must've hidden the information elsewhere. Look around the Inventor's Library; do you see any databanks there?$B$BThat might be the disk's purpose. Try using it near some of those databanks. Perhaps it's set to retrieve and store information from them. After you've tried your hand at that, contact me again and let me know what you've found. Meanwhile, I'll be trying to track down the other half of the archive key.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Inventor's Disk to retrieve 7 pieces of Hidden Data from the Databanks. </LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you try using the disk? What did you find?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Brann looks at the disk as you hold it up.&gt;$B$BI can't tell if there's anything stored there or not, $g lad:lass;. You'll have to tell me what happened.$B$B&lt;You describe the data retrieval process.&gt;$B$BSo it worked? At least we can count on Keeper Mimir to be systematic.</RewardText>
