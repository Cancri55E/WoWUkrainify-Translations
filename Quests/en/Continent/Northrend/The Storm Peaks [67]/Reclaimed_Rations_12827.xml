  <Title>Reclaimed Rations</Title>
  <Description>Hey hey! You're a new face! Care to lend Ricket a hand?$B$BWe have a somewhat unexpected problem - food shortage. I know, I know... we should have seen that coming, but you don't get it. We tend to have somewhat of a quick turn-around here with our sapper squad and all, so usually we don't have to worry about long term eats. Good old K3's gotten popular though.$B$BConvenient solution? There are gnoll camps to the west and some gnolls scattered, scavenging as gnolls do. Care to go nab some of their rations?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ricket at K3 wants you to repossess 16 Dried Gnoll Rations from the nearby Savage Hill Gnolls.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hey there again! My belly's rumbling... how'd it go?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I hope they weren't too hesitant to share the wealth. We've been pretty forgiving with them picking through our leftovers thus far.</RewardText>
