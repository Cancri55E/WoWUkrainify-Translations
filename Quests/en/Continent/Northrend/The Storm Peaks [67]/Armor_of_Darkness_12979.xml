  <Title>Armor of Darkness</Title>
  <Description>This armor plate is thick and oversized compared to the rest of the golem's defenses. A quick examination of the golem's corpse reveals that this heavier plate seems to have been bolted on as an afterthought or a crude upgrade.$B$BWhy would the iron dwarves have added this redundant and mismatched armor to their war golems?$B$BPerhaps Bruor Ironbane would know if he had the chance to examine several of these plates from stormforged war golems.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 4 Dark Armor Samples to Bruor Ironbane at Bouldercrag's Refuge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>What is it you have there?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Careful, now. Keep that plate as far away from me as you can. Even being in its presence is enough to inflict pain.$B$BBut you're right, $n, these are gigantic armor plates for a war golem of normal size. What would the stormforged be doing with them? There's only one way to find out.</RewardText>
