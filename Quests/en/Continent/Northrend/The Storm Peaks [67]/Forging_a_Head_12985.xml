  <Title>Forging a Head</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, $r.$b$bI have a task that King Jokkum felt you would be suited for, assuming you still strive to gain favor with our people.$b$bI have developed plans for another artifact, one that will grant Hodir's blessing of protection to our stronghold. I have nearly all that I require for its construction. All that remains to collect are the very eyes of our fallen enemies.$b$bTake this tool, and gather the eyes from the iron giant corpses that litter our fields.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Njormeld in Dun Niffelem needs you to use the Diamond Tipped Pick on the Dead Iron Giants at Frostfield Lake and return to him when you have collected 8 Stormforged Eyes.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you collected the final components I seek, $r?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It is nearly done.$b$bWith this artifact in place, Dun Niffelem shall be warned of impending dangers before they are upon us.</RewardText>
