  <Title>Expression of Gratitude</Title>
  <Description>I know just the job for an eager newcomer! We've got a gnoll problem. You might even call it a gnoll infestation! Pesky things. They keep creeping up more and more, and now they're on our doorstep, stealing our parts! Inconceivable.$B$BIt all begins and ends with their uppity leader, Gnarlhide. I want you to see to that "ends" part. Go pay him a visit at his camp all the way to the west, in Snowblind Hills.$B$BAnd when I say "pay him a visit," that's a euphemism for "kill him painfully." Kay? Kay!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ricket at K3 wants you to kill Gnarlhide.</LogDescription>
