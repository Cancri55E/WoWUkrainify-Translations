  <Title>The Heart of the Storm</Title>
  <Description>According to the documents you captured at Narvir's Cradle, the iron colossus is complete except for one key component -- the Heart of the Storm.$B$BWithout it, the iron colossus' weapons would be much weaker than the design predicts. If we can deny Overseer Narvir the heart, we could defeat the colossus!$B$BNotes on the documents you found say that the heart is in Uldis, a titan facility far to the south. Its entrance is on the south side of a tall mountain overlooking the Bor's Breath River.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge wants you to travel to Uldis and try to prevent Overseer Narvir from obtaining the Heart of the Storm.</LogDescription>
