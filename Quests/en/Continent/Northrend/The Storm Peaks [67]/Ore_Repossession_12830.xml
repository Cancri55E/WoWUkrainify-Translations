  <Description>We're moving in!$B$BThere were some snobolds here when we arrived... their mining operation seems to have met some unfortunate happenings though. Doesn't much matter - we were taking over soon anyway.$B$BI sent some of our miners in there to get me some ore samples that I can use to calibrate our machines for processing, but they haven't come back.$B$BMind going in there and nabbing some samples for me in their stead?
