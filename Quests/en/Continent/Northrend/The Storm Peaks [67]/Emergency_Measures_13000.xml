  <Title>Emergency Measures</Title>
  <Description>The cold in these mountains is brutal.  We have a day or two before we burn up all the wood from the wreckage.$B$BWe spotted worgs inside a cave directly east of here.  I need you to find the cave and obtain some furs.  It might not sound like much, but it might be the difference between freezing to death and living another day.$B$BWorgs don't hunt alone, so I'm giving you a flare.  It should buy you some time if you find yourself outnumbered.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bloodguard Lorga wants you to go to the Gimorak's Den to the east and obtain 6 Worg Furs.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you bring the furs?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>These furs are rather... large.  I'd hate to see the worgs you had to face off with.$B$BWe're all very thankful.  The temperature is starting to drop already.</RewardText>
