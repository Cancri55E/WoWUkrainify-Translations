  <Title>Sirana Iceshriek</Title>
  <Description>This Sirana Iceshriek sounds like the one that's spurring the harpies to be more aggressive. If we kill her, I suspect their attacks won't last long afterwards.$B$BOne of our stormriders claims to have spotted her circling the peak directly northwest of here.  Go find the wench and put her down. Let's see this done.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Glorthal Stiffbeard at Frosthold wants you to kill Sirana Iceshriek.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>It's too cold here for the usual pests... we get harpies. Lucky us.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>It's done then. Thank you.$B$BI've spoken with Fjorlin - he said that his men will take charge of keeping the harpies down a bit. As long as we don't let up again, they won't find the courage to think they can attack our people.$B$BI know this wasn't the most tasteful work - take this as a token of my appreciation.</RewardText>
