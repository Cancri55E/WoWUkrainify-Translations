  <Title>Facing the Storm</Title>
  <Description>Like Bouldercrag, I once served the keepers as a craftsman in Ulduar, but with Loken's betrayal, I turned my hammer toward our new foes.$B$BWhen we could spare the men, I led raids on Nidavelir to relieve the pressure on our defenders, but our lines are near collapse.$B$BYou've proven yourself a capable combatant and a staunch ally. Perhaps you'd be willing to take up our banner and take the fight to Nidavelir, the iron dwarf stronghold to the southwest, across the Snowdrift Plains.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bruor Ironbane at Bouldercrag's Refuge wants you to kill 10 Nidavelir Stormforged. You may kill Stormforged Champions, Stormforged Magi, or Stormforged War Golems.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you taken the hammer to the irons at Nidavelir?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There may be hope for victory, $n. We have never been able to sustain an attack on the stormforged, but with your efforts, Valduran may yet fall!</RewardText>
