  <Title>The Missing Bronzebeard</Title>
  <Description>Before we left, I received the file Scout Vor'takh compiled on this Brann Bronzebeard. There can be no doubt that Brann was headed for the Storm Peaks from his journal entries and findings in Grizzly Hills. Before we crashed, I caught sight of a campsite south of here, across the Foot Steppes, and overlooking the frozen Bor's Breath River.$B$BIf Brann isn't there, search the camp and its environs for any clues as to where that blasted dwarf might've gone. Bring back anything you find.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve the Burlap-Wrapped Note from Brann's camp and return it to Boktar Bloodfury at the Grom'arsh Crash-Site.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you have any luck finding Bronzebeard's camp?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Of course, with our luck, I probably could've predicted this. Well, we're not going to let him get away that easily. Let's see what that note says.</RewardText>
