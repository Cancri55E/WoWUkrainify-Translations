  <Title>Hit Them Where it Hurts</Title>
  <Description>Bouldercrag's got a good plan to stymie the efforts of the iron dwarves at Narvir's Cradle, and I've got an idea of my own. Work on the iron colossus will come to a halt without any artisans.$B$BNarvir's Cradle is on the south side of the hill sheltering Bouldercrag's Refuge. Go there and slay any stormforged artificers in your path. They may be no different from what we once were, but they build a weapon that threatens us all.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill 10 Stormforged Artificers and return to Bruor Ironbane at Bouldercrag's Refuge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Have you decimated the iron colossus' workforce?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>There were days when I could never ask someone to do what you did, but my experience with the iron dwarves has extinguished those feelings. We have bought time against the enemy's advance.</RewardText>
