  <Title>Sniffing Out the Perpetrator</Title>
  <Description>The tone of Brann's note suggests he meant to bury something with the note, maybe a pack of some kind. You're sure this was all you found?$B$BOkay, I'm going to have you take one of these frosthounds with you. The frostborn use them for tracking. Bring it to the destroyed camp and let it get Brann's scent.$B$BIt should at least lead you to the location of those missing possessions, and if we're lucky, Brann himself. </Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Frosthound Collar at the Abandoned Camp to track down whoever took Brann's possessions. When you recover them, use the communication device and speak to whoever you can contact.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Who are you?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You... you're not a member of the Explorers' League, at least not one I remember. But, if you recovered the communicator, they must've sent you. Good, that's almost what I was hoping for.$B$B</RewardText>
