  <Description>Oi... it's like there's a propeller in my stomach.$B$BI think I can walk, but I got something nasty in my system when I got bit by something in the back of the cave. It was bigger than the other spiders... and brightly colored.$B$BRicket can probably make me an antidote, but she'd need the venom sac from whatever bit me. Would you mind finding it for me? I don't think Tore's coming.$B$BI'll just pretend I'm dead here and hopefully they'll leave me alone.</Description>
