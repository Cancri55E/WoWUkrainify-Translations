  <Title>Cell Block Tango</Title>
  <Description>The sapper squad is ready. That means it's time for fun!$B$BThere's only one thing holding us up from our full-scale assault on Garm! I sent a runner to set a teleporter up behind him--successfully I might add--and he returned to get the power cell it needs to function. It isn't working yet... which means the power cell didn't get there.$B$BI need you to look just on the other side of Garm's Bane for the power cell. When you find it, bring it farther east to Garm's Rise and activate the teleporter.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ricket at K3 would like you to locate the Transporter Power Cell and use it to activate the Transportation Pad at Garm's Rise.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Even magnataur should know not to mess with goblins.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Excellent!$B$B&lt;A fierce grin creeps onto Ricket's face.&gt;$B$BLet the destruction begin!</RewardText>
