  <Title>Forging an Alliance</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Thorim, for the first time since your meeting him, smiles.&gt;$b$bThis is all beginning to have the smell of fate's hand, $r.$b$bYour discovery is what remains of my armor, long ago cast off in a fit of grief and left to the elements. Only the sons of Hodir are capable of its reforging, for they are its original creators.$b$bPerhaps you've done enough to soften their hatred of me. Seek out their king, Jokkum, if he still breathes.$b$bFind your way into his good graces and plead for his assistance.</Description>
  <LogDescription>You are to go to Dun Niffelem and ask King Jokkum to allow Thorim's armor to be reforged. After completing Jokkum's task, you are to speak with Njormeld in Dun Niffelem.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It would seem that I have refined my technique considerably. That, or the legends surrounding this anvil are true.$b$bThis suit of armor is superior to the last, and took less material to create.$b$bWith the excess, I was able to fashion you a little something as payment for your assistance.</RewardText>
