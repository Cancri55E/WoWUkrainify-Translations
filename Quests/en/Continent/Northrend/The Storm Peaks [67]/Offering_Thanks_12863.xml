  <Title>Offering Thanks</Title>
  <Description>Ah! Thanks for coming up here, $G lad:lass;.$B$BJudging by your wide eyes and shivering hands, I'd venture a guess that you're somewhat new. Sounds like it would be good for you to meet our gracious hosts then!$B$BWe've got some extra medical supplies... to be honest, we weren't expecting to have such a comfortable setup. Go ahead and give this crate to Glorthal over there, and lend them a hand if you would too. We don't want them to think we're ungrateful for how welcoming they've been.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the crate of medical supplies to Glorthal Stiffbeard in Frosthold.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Hello.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Medical supplies? Thank you! Not exactly sure what to do with them to be honest, but I'm sure they'll be useful.$B$BIt's good to meet you... there's such a colorful variety among your peoples. We're not used to having visitors up this way very often - it's good to have some fresh company.</RewardText>
