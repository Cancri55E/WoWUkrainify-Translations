  <Title>The Gifts of Loken</Title>
  <Description>The one who commands the stormforged iron dwarves is called Runeseer Valduran. Although I have never seen them, it is said that his master, Keeper Loken, who took over Ulduar, has given Valduran powerful titan artifacts.$B$BIt could explain the strength and ferocity my men see in the stormforged warriors.$B$BValduran's base, Nidavelir, lies to the southwest, across the Snowdrift Plains. Go there, $n, and neutralize his power. Destroy these gifts of Loken's and help us to sap the strength of his followers.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy Loken's Fury, Loken's Power, and Loken's Favor, and return to Bouldercrag the Rockshaper at Bouldercrag's Refuge.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Is it true? Does Valduran possess powerful relics of the titans? Did you destroy them?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Bouldercrag nods grimly.&gt;$B$BYou've weakened the stormforged considerably, but they'll keep fighting. Their casualties matter nothing to them, while our defenders continue to fall. Even if it costs them a hundred or a thousand iron corpses, they'll keep fighting until we've been pounded to gravel.</RewardText>
