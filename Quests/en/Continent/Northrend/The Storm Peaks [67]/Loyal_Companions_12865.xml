  <Title>Loyal Companions</Title>
  <Description>Fresh blood! Good to meet ya! I've got some work if you've got some time.$B$BOff to the east are the Foot Steppes... pretty hard land, but there's quite a group of rhino that graze there. Our birds have a taste for that rhino meat, but it's always a bit dangerous for them to go hunting with all of the proto-drakes that nest around there.$B$BIf you're keen, head over that way and get some rhino meat, bring it back to the peaks above here, and then use it to feed some of the eagles that nest there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Fjorlin Frostbrow at Frosthold wants you to obtain 8 slabs of Fresh Ice Rhino Meat and use them to feed the Stormcrest Eagles above town.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>These birds have been loyal to us for a long time... we get on pretty well.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Thank you, kindly... and I'm sure they're quite appreciative too. They make powerful allies; you'll be well off being on this side of their graces.</RewardText>
