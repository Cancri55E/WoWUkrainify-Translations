  <Title>The Silver Covenant's Scheme</Title>
  <Description>One of my contacts in the Underbelly caught sight of a Silver Covenant agent gathering information at the Cantrips and Crows Tavern. Silver Covenant members aren't normally found in the sewers, so they must be plotting something.$B$BGo into the Underbelly, find this Silver Covenant agent, and eliminate him. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let those simpering Silver Covenant weaklings get it back to Icecrown before we do.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Capture the Silver Covenant Orders.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you find anything of use on that agent?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>&lt;Magister Hathorel reads the captured orders.&gt;$B$BThe agent you intercepted was supposed to deliver the Wyrmrest tome to Icecrown, after meeting with one Arcanist Tybalin inside the Silver Enclave. We have to reclaim that book, $N, and we only have one chance before it leaves the city. We have to work quickly.</RewardText>
