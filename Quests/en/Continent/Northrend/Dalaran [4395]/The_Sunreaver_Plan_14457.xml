  <Title>The Sunreaver Plan</Title>
  <Description>One of my contacts in the Underbelly caught sight of a Sunreaver agent buying reagents from a dealer in the Black Market area. The Sunreavers normally aren't known for their interest in what goes on in the sewers, so that's a big indication they're planning something.$B$BHead into the Underbelly, find this Sunreaver agent, and take care of them. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let them get it back to Icecrown first.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain the Sunreaver Orders.</LogDescription>
