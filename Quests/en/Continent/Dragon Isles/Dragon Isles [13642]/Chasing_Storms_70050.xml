  <Title>Chasing Storms</Title>
  <Description>So the handsome fellas are sendin' ye on a wee adventure, eh?

That's fine. The expedition won't be able to set sail until someone gets those elemental storms under control anyway.

Check-in with Storm Hunter William. He's leading the expedition efforts to investigate the storms and can outfit ye with whatever gear you need.

I'll coordinate the rest of the preparations here while ye have all the fun out there.

Ye'll owe me one, though!</Description>

  <RewardText>If you're heading into those storms, you're going to need all the help you can get.

Lucky for you, I've been stocking up on storm-chasing gear for years.

Take a look, and see what fits.</RewardText>
