  <Title>The Dragon Isles Await</Title>
  <Description>Heroes of the Horde, I bring news. The Dragon Isles are awakening!

The Isles went dormant in the wake of the Sundering. But now, at long last, they have called my kin and I home.

While the Isles hold many wonders, it is also a perilous land. We will require the aid of our mortal allies to reclaim our legacy.

I am about to present the Aspects' invitation to the Horde Council in Orgrimmar. Meet me there and we shall see what they have to say.</Description>
