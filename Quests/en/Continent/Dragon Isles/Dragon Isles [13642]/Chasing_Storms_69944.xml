  <Title>Chasing Storms</Title>
  <Description>Well, that wizard certainly knows how to make an entrance, doesn't he?

We won't be able to set sail until someone gets those elemental storms under control.

Check-in with Storm Huntress Suhrakka. She's leading the expedition efforts to investigate the storms and can help outfit you with whatever gear you need.

While you handle that, I'll coordinate the rest of the preparations. At least it'll give me some time to read a few more volumes on dragon history before we set sail.</Description>

  <RewardText>These storms are wild, dangerous things. If you wish to confront them, you'll want extra protection.

In my years of hunting, I've gathered many things that helped ward against the wrath of the elements. Perhaps some of them may be of use to you as well.</RewardText>
