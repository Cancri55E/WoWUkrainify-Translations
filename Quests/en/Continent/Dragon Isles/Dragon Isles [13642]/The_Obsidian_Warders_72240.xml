  <Title>The Obsidian Warders</Title>
  <Description>This Toddy's enthusiasm is admirable. But I hope it does not blind her to the dangers awaiting us in the Dragon Isles.

Regardless, the Obsidian Warders are duty-bound to protect the expedition.

I must speak with Wrathion and the Lord Commander about the mission ahead.

My fellow dracthyr are exploring the city. Seek out Dervishian, my trusted lieutenant, and inform her that we are to rally at the docks. She will relay my orders to the rest.</Description>

  <QuestCompletionLog>Deliver the news of your success to Toddy Whiskers at Stormwind Harbor.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <CompletionText>Ye think a dracthyr can fly faster than a gryphon?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I'm pleased the dracthyr are comin' with us.

Can't wait to challenge that scalecommander to a race on ol' Wildfeather.

My gryphon will best his leathery ol' wings any day!</RewardText>
