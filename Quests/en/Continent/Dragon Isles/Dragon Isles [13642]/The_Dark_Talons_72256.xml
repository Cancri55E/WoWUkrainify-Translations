  <Title>The Dark Talons</Title>
  <Description>Naleidea is enthusiastic, but she's a historian, not a soldier. She knows nothing of the dangers we'll face in the Dragon Isles.

Not that anyone needs to worry. After all, the Dark Talons will be protecting the expedition.

I'm going to discuss mission logistics with Ebyssian and your Horde leaders.

My lieutenant, Kodethi, is exploring the city along with the other dracthyr. Be a good soldier and let him know we are going to rally at the zeppelin tower. He'll relay my orders to the others.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver the Scalecommander's orders to Kodethi and the Dark Talons.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Meet Naleidea at the zeppelin tower outside Orgrimmar.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>I am pleased to have the dracthyr accompanying us on the expedition.

Their unique perspective should prove valuable, and learning more of their own history will help them come to terms with their current circumstances.

As I've said before, history heals every wound.</RewardText>
