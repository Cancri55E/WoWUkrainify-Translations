  <Title>Case Closed</Title>
  <Description>You are lucky we arrived when we did. We intercepted the Nokhud reinforcements about to flank you during your fight with Jamoku.

We lost two of our number in that battle. Their bodies have already been recovered. Bovan's is the last.

The Nokhud will not take long to rally and hunt us down. We must leave now.

Head to Toghusuq Village, where the tauren are encamped. We will meet you there.</Description>
