  <Title>Others Call Me Duck Herder</Title>
  <Description>My days grow shorter... Still my duties are not done. 

The brood should all be by the creek. I leave them there hoping they will grow more independent. Soon they will have to fend for themselves.

Today they will rely on you. Please bring them the food you caught, and then the ducklings to me. Be wary of Pilot, she is always jumping off something.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Feed $1oa ducklings and return to Gracus.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>My beautiful ducklings! You look so strong!

Pilot, come. Play time is over. 

&lt;Pilot refuses to leave your side and tries to hide behind your legs. Until Gracus scoops her up.&gt; 

Seems she likes you.</RewardText>
