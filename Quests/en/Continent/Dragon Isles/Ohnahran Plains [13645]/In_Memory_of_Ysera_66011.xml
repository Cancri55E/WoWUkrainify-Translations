  <Title>In Memory of Ysera</Title>
  <Description>Oh, no! Now I think I understand. Theramus...he misses Ysera, and she can't come back.

Come! I suspect I know where he went. We won't bother him further, but it'll be good to tell him that we're sorry, and that we'll give him the space he wants.

We are here for each other, within the nature all around us.</Description>
