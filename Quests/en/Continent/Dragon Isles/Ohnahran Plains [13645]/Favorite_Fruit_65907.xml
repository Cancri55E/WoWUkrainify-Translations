  <Title>Favorite Fruit</Title>
  <Description>Mystic training is so boring. I'm watching water be wet half of my days. My brothers are already out in the wild hunting drakes and primalists, and making a difference in the world.

Anyway, I promised I'd show you something cool! Did you know mudstompers love bushfruit? It grows nearby, among the geysers. Go pick some and we can feed them together.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Forage Wild Bushfruit from the Ohn'ir Geysers and feed them to $1oa Lounging Mudstompers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Seems like they like you! Or just the fruit. That's okay too. &lt;Radiya winks.&gt;</RewardText>
