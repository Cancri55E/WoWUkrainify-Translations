  <Title>Fowl Sorcery</Title>
  <Description>It is said that Ohn'ahra infused the spear of our ancestor, Maruuk, with her power. Balakar Khan must have told the Primalists about that legend.

They have stolen the magic from Ohn'ahra's children, polluted it with storm sorcery, and infused it into ballista bolts. Why would the Nokhud need such weapons?

We shouldn't wait to find out. These storm bolts are being loaded into wagons for transport. Take my totems and place one atop each wagon you come across. My wind magic will smash them to pieces.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Boku's Wind Totem to destroy the Nokhud wagons.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'm sure there's more out there, but we destroyed what we could. Hopefully, this will at least slow them down.</RewardText>
