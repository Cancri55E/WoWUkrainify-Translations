  <Title>Taken By Storm</Title>
  <Description>According to reports, the Nokhud were accompanied by an outsider wielding never-before-seen magic. This outsider tore through our ranks like a tempest. 

If the Nokhud have allies who can wreak this much havoc, we must find out as much as we can about them.

I have sent my ohuna, Altan, to find this outsider. She has not flown back, and I am concerned. $n, can you search for clues about this outsider and see what has become of Altan?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rescue Altan and search for clues about the outsider.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So, we are at war with both the Nokhud and the Primalists. Now it is even more critical that we get Ohn'ahra and the dragons on our side.

Thank you for your assistance, $n, and thank you for saving Altan.</RewardText>
