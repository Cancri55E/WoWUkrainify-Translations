  <Title>Sole Supplier</Title>
  <Description>Poor Roscha! She has toiled endlessly to prepare for the caravan, only for her supplies to be stolen by nasty gorlocs. 

She has lost so much already. I am doing my best to assist her. 

Khasar likely went after her supplies alone, telling no one. It is his way. But he has been gone too long. Many dogs are missing as well. 

Would you please check on Khasar and the dogs, $p?</Description>
