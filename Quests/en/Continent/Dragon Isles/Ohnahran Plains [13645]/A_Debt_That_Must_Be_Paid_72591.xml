  <Title>A Debt That Must Be Paid</Title>
  <Description>$n, I have heard you cultivated good relations with the centaur of the Ohn'ahran Plains. I would like to ask a favor.

Baine left for the plains a few days ago in search of a group of missing tauren. I offered to accompany him, but he insisted on going alone.

The tauren of Thunder Bluff have a long and bloody history with the centaur of Kalimdor, as does Baine. While the Maruuk centaur are unrelated, I still have my concerns.

Your presence could help smooth tensions. I hope.</Description>
