  <Description>We've discovered why the Nokhud want mystic totems. They can be used to capture the Children of Ohn'ahra. Though the Nokhud have stolen the totems, the Primalists are the ones behind this blasphemy.

The Children of Ohn'ahra are sacred ohuna, blessed by the Windmother herself. Please, $n, free any ohuna you see! And if you come across any Primalists...

&lt;Boku trails off, but his expression is one of grim determination.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Free $1oa Children of Ohn'ahra and eliminate $2oa Primalists at Windsong Rise.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>After all Ohn'ahra has done for us, we must do all we can to help her children. Thank you, $n.</RewardText>
