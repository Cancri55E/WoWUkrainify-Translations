  <Title>Renewal of Vows</Title>
  <Description>Centuries ago, I made a vow of friendship and cooperation with the first centaur. Although much has changed, I feel it is time for us to renew that vow again.

A recitation was composed to help future generations of centaur remember their bond with the green dragonflight. Each verse must be answered with an offering from the khans. I hope the centaur can still remember the original meanings.

The choice of gift is critical. Choose the right offering, and our allegiance is bound.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Sansok Khan, Tigari Khan, Khanam Matra Sarest, and Merithra exchange gifts.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Now that our bonds are renewed, nothing can stand in our way. By wind and wing, so be it.</RewardText>
