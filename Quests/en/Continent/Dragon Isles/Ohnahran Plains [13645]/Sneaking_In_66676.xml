  <Title>Sneaking In</Title>
  <Description>This is Lizi... she's my secret friend. I've been taking care of her since she was rejected by her mother.

This isn't looking good. Whatever they did to her is beyond my knowledge. I have to bring her home. My Ohn may ground me for the rest of time, but Lizi must get help. I am ever grateful to you, $p. I'm sorry this was more trouble than you signed up for.

If you wouldn't mind one more adventure... please face my Ohn's wrath with me? Meet me back at the springs.</Description>
