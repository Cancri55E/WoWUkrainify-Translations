  <Description>Oh, $p.

Do you feel comfort under the sun? Do you feel safe under its bright caress? Does each new day represent hope for the future and a chance to live your life as you've always dreamt it?

Then you know love as I do.

Narman of Clan Shikaar is my sun. He is my warmth. He is my light. He is my hope.

A man like him deserves a proposal worthy of stature.

We must seek guidance from an Ohn.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Windsage Dawa prepare for the perfect proposal.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Arbhog's horns? They'll do just fine.

Arbhog was once the mightiest musken on the plains. These are a fitting gift for the mightiest hunter. I am sure Narman will appreciate them.

Perhaps one day he will teach me to hunt. An Ohn'ir huntsman. Ha! Imagine that.</RewardText>
