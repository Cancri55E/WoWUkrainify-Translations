  <Title>The Gentle Giant</Title>
  <Description>If Taivan is really as "un-ferocious" as Jadar says he is, perhaps he'll be better suited as a herding bakar! 

The Aylaag are expert argali shepherds, and aren't so proud that they require lavish gifts to help another clan. 

Please send Taivan to Shepherd Tevatei at the Mallakh, a spot between two hills in the south-west where they train their bakar.

Ohn'ahra, please let this work. If it doesn't, I'm all out of ideas.</Description>
