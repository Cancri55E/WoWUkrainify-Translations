  <Title>A Disgruntled Initiate</Title>
  <Description>I received an interesting letter from Ohn'iri Springs.

As for the letter's contents, it details, quote, horrid imprisonment, controlling mentors, and extreme boredom. It is formally signed by Initiate Radiya. There's also a sketch of an eagle... kicking a centaur named Meluun off a cliff.

Well. I suppose this is a call for help, if you are so inclined to see for yourself. To be frank, I think Radiya is probably okay. She sends me such letters often.</Description>
