  <Description>As you've no doubt seen, this land contains creatures which grow beyond their normal size.

We consider these beasts as blessed by the gods of the wild, and they are often considered honorable targets for hunters to prove their strength. One of these beasts, which we call Karkidan, is nearby. I would be most impressed if you managed to take it down.</Description>
