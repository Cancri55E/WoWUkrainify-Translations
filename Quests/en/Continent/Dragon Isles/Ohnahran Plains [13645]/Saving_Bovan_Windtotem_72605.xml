  <Title>Saving Bovan Windtotem</Title>
  <Description>Time is against us, $n. We must find Bovan as quickly as possible.

This hold is teeming with centaur. Our search will go faster if we split up--and it will be easier to slip by the patrols.

Take one of these potions I brought. It should help you go undetected, but beware of the Nokhud wardogs. If Tomul spoke correctly, they will sniff you out.

Search the area for Bovan. If you find him, get him out. Do not wait for me.</Description>
