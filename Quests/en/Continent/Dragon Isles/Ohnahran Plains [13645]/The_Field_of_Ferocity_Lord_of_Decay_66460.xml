  <Title>The Field of Ferocity: Lord of Decay!</Title>
  <Description>I tried to get one of those nasty gnolls for this gauntlet. Unfortunately, none of my associates know how to speak with them.
 
We did manage to catch one of their freaky creations though. That should serve as a good opponent! Let me know when you want to start the second round!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat Nightrot.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'm glad you dealt with that as quickly as you did. The stench was starting to reach the podium here.</RewardText>
