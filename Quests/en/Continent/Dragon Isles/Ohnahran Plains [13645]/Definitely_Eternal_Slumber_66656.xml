  <Title>Definitely Eternal Slumber</Title>
  <Description>The ancestors are gripped by this dark magic. They will fight before they follow. The Ukhel raised our fiercest warriors and hunters. Stopping them will be no easy task.

I'm going to come along and help. It's time I put my mother's spear back to use.

Once they are defeated, use this totem I've crafted to help the subdued spirits find their way back to the kurgans.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat each renowned centaur spirit, then use Zorig's Totem of Respite to release them.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'm so relieved that my mother is at peace again. Thank you, $n!</RewardText>
