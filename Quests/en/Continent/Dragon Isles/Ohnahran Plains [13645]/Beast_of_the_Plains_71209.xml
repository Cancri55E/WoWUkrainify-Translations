  <Title>Beast of the Plains</Title>
  <Description>I think Lizi is ready to be a beast of the plains again. She's so friendly to you and I now, but I can tell she wants to return to the wild.

One day, when I am a Windsage, I will explore all of the world beyond these springs. But first--my midseason initiate trials! How time flies.

I made a saddle and reins from the wool you gathered. Lizi will be happy to come at your call.

Please take her on all the adventures, $p.</Description>
