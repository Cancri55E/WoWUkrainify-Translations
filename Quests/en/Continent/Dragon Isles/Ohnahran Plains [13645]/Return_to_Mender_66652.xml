  <Description>I can't see what they're doing from here, but I fear they're desecrating the kurgans.

Please go to the nearest tomb, and see if you can stop the ritual they're performing. 

And if you find anything that may tell us their purpose here, please bring it back to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Investigate the Ukhel ritual at the nearby mound.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return the spear to Zorig.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>This spear... it belonged to my mother, Cathan. She was a great hunter. When she got sick, I... I couldn't save her.

Like all great Maruuk centaur, she was buried with her weapon. But this means the Ukhel are using these weapons to raise spirits and bind them to their service - including my mother!</RewardText>
