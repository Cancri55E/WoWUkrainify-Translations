  <Title>License to Hunt</Title>
  <Description>Ah, finally ready to prove yourself as a hunter? Keep in mind this is not as simple as running around and hunting everything that moves. The Shikaar hunt with purpose. We hunt to feed and clothe the clan, to prove our strength against mighty foes, and to balance nature.

We do not hunt the land barren, we sow the seeds for future Grand Hunts as we go. Prove yourself capable of following these instructions and you may join us.

However I do not have confidence in your friend there succeeding.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Complete the Grand Hunt training tasks.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Excellent! You are ready to join the Grand Hunts! 

Please inform this Nesingwary Jr. that there is more to hunting than mindless killing and that he is unwelcome to join us.</RewardText>
