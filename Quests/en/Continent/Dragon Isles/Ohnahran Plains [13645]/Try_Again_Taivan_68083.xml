  <Title>Try Again, Taivan!</Title>
  <Description>Return to the Teerai and tell them that not even I can train Taivan to be a hunter. He simply does not have it in him.

He is the most un-ferocious bakar I have ever seen, and I bet he would even try to make friends with the wild game if we let him! Hah!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Healer Selbekh in Maruukai and deliver the bad news.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Healer Selbekh in Maruukai</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Taivan just returned. They could not have trained him so quickly could they? No... I suppose not.

&lt;She sighs deeply and looks at Taivan.&gt;

He doesn't seem to be taking it well, either. I have one more idea, and if this doesn't work, we will have to make some difficult decisions.</RewardText>
