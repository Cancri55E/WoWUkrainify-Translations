  <Title>With the Wind at Our Backs</Title>
  <Description>So the Primalists have recruited Clan Nokhud as allies. 

We have held off the Primalists until now, but the Nokhud have brought a new weapon: a dragonkiller ballista. I fear Solethus will not be the last dragon to fall to its foul storm magic.

Come. I will take you to the dragons' haven at Shady Sanctuary. You can tell me what you know of the Nokhud while the Khanam Matra gathers her forces. We must prepare for our next move.</Description>
