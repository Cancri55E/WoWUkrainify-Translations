  <Title>A Place of Refuge</Title>
  <Description>Our next priority is to catch up with the others who fled during Bovan's stand. Hopefully, Bovan and the other braves have regrouped with them.

This Tomul says the most likely place the tauren would seek refuge is an abandoned village to the southeast. 

While her reasoning is sound, this is also the perfect location for a trap.

$n, I know you vouch for her, so I will give her the benefit of the doubt.

Let us hope your trust in her is not misplaced.</Description>
