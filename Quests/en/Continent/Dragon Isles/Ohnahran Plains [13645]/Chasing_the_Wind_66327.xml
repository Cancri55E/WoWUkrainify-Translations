  <Title>Chasing the Wind</Title>
  <Description>We must take a moment to pause and consider our strategy. 

We need Ohn'ahra's blessing to sound the Horn of Drusahl and summon the green dragons. Without their aid, we cannot win this war. The Nokhud already outnumber the other clans, and their forces are bolstered by the Primalists. And now Koroleth has captured our Windmother! We must therefore find Ohn'ahra before the Nokhud can launch their final attack and encircle Maruukai.

I will send all of our scouts. I only hope we can find her in time.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Listen to Scout Tomul's report.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We are too late. The Nokhud have overrun the Horn of Drusahl and slaughtered my people. 

This act of aggression will not go unanswered.</RewardText>
