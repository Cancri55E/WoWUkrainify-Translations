  <Description>Balakar will marshal his forces for war. I will do the same, but we are outnumbered.

The dragons have asked for our aid, and we can use their help to even the odds. To answer their call for an alliance, I must blow the Horn of Drusahl, but I need Ohn'ahra's blessing. Will you help me?

Go to Teerakai and deliver my declaration of war to my lieutenant, Jebotai. He will marshal my forces and direct you to the mystics who can find Ohn'ahra.</Description>
