  <Title>The Isle of Emerald</Title>
  <Description>Your part in this has not escaped me, mortal. It is in large part due to your bravery that we were able to defeat the Primalists.

Follow this path through the archway across the water and into the trees beyond. I will wait for you there.</Description>
