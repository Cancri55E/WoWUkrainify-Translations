  <Description>&lt;Watu mumbles to himself, eyes closed and arms crossed.&gt;

Of course I get gored by a stag, of all creatures. Now I'm just another one who needs help. My brother will get all the credit, and no one back home will be surprised.

&lt;Watu looks up.&gt; What? What's that you've got there? Glowing rocks? I'll look at one, but take the rest to somebody else. I'm a hunter, not an archaeologist. &lt;Watu snorts, glaring at his leg.&gt; Maybe this is a sign for me to switch jobs. Go on, you've proven more useful than I.</Description>
