  <Title>Proto Problems</Title>
  <Description>I hold no love for the Sundered Flame, but even I cannot stand idle while they rip themselves apart like this. It is all too familiar.

Whatever this Locus is, it is safer in our hands than in their clutches. Follow the trail of bodies and I suspect we will find it.

Do be careful, $p. I worry we will find that the nest is not quite as abandoned as it appears.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Acquire the Locus and defeat the protodrake that protects it.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $p.

You have been most helpful.</RewardText>
