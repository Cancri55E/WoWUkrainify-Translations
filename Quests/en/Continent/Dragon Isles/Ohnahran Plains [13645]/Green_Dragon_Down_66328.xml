  <Title>Green Dragon Down</Title>
  <Description>Those dragons went down over the plains to the west. We must get to them quickly before the Nokhud do.

We would not want them to think of all Maruuk as their enemies because of Balakar's actions.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet the Khanam Matra at the watering hole.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Our ancestors said the green dragons were tempered and wise. We are fortunate they restrained their anger long enough to hear our side of the story.

Now that we know the Primalists and Nokhud are our common enemy, it is time to take them down.</RewardText>
