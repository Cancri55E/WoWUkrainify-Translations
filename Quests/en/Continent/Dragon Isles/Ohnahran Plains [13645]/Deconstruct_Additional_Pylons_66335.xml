  <Title>Deconstruct Additional Pylons</Title>
  <Description>With those vile weapons destroyed, the green dragonflight can join the fray in force.

We are much more familiar with the situation on the ground. We need to light up some targets, so Merithra and her dragons can strike from above.

Merithra gave me these enchanted seeds. Place them near the Primalist pylons. We will use their light to call in attacks from airborne dragons.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Mark the Primalist Pylons with Enchanted Seeds.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I will remain forever grateful that the dragons were on our side during this battle.</RewardText>
