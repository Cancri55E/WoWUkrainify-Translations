  <Title>Find Theramus</Title>
  <Description>$R! Are you here to visit the beautiful Lilac Ramble? I'm so sorry about its current state. I promise it's not usually this untended!

Theramus, the garden's keeper, was supposed to meet us today and tackle the issues together. He's been struggling with the upkeep lately, so Felina and I are helping out. But we can't do it all.

Would you help us look around for him? Maybe he did forget.</Description>
