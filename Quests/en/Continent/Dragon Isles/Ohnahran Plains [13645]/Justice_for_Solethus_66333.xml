  <Title>Justice for Solethus</Title>
  <Description>So long as a single green dragon draws breath, these Primalists will not defile the Ancient Bough without a fight.

We are eager to do our part in this battle, but as long as those dragonkiller ballistae are on the field, we cannot approach. The Nokhud's strongest warriors guard them, so you will need to take down the warriors as well.

Destroy the ballistae and Nokhud Warmongers. Eliminate this threat, and the green dragons will turn the tide of battle.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa Nokhud Warmongers and destroy $2oa Dragon-Killer Ballistae.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Good riddance to those awful weapons. May no other dragon suffer as Solethus did.</RewardText>
