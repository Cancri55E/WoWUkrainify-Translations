  <Title>Up to No-khud</Title>
  <Description>The Nokhud and Ukhel clans have overtaken the Eternal Kurgans. Their purpose can only be malign. Our most esteemed ancestors are buried there.

I sent Initiate Zorig to investigate. He still has not returned.

He is capable, but lacking in confidence. Please help him put a stop to their foul activities!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet Initiate Zorig at the Eternal Kurgans.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Clan Ukhel dishonors itself with dark magic. Now they have moved into the kurgans with their Nokhud allies. Neither clan should be here! I've been watching from here, where I'm safely out of sight.</RewardText>
