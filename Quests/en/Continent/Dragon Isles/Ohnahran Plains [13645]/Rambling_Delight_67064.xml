  <Title>Rambling Delight</Title>
  <Description>Oh, Rumiastrasza! Myself and the dryad sisters, Celina and Felina, had a lovely evening cooking for her.

The kelp we ate is a unique strain called Glimmering Ramblekelp. Swarms of frillfish devour them all along the coast. I wouldn't be surprised if they attack you while you're plucking their food from the sea floor.

Please give the chefs my best when you see them. They're always welcome here in our sanctuary.</Description>
