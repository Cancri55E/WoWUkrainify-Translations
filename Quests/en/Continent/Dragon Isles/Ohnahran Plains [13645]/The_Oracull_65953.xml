  <Title>The Ora-cull</Title>
  <Description>Of all the madness in this gorloc village, I have discovered none so troubling as the gorloc shamans.

They are particularly vicious and play recklessly with storm magic with no regard for the consequences. 

This must be put to an end. Slay them, and bring me their totems. Our mystics will be interested in them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa totems from gorloc shamans.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Khasar frowns at the totems.&gt;

These totems are for storm magic. Storm magic is sacrilege to the gift of winds given by Ohn'ahra herself.

I will deliver these to the mystics.</RewardText>
