  <Title>Taivan's Purpose</Title>
  <Description>Do you see that young one, sitting by themselves over on the bank of the stream?

&lt;She points to the northeast, where you see a young-looking Centaur staring at the water.&gt;

Chimei lost both of their parents in the Nokhud attack. I have healed all of their physical wounds, but they have not eaten or said a word to anyone since we found them. They just sit and stare. 

This is beyond my skills, and I am at a loss. Will you try to talk to them, $n?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Try to comfort the centaur orphan Chimei.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Selbekh's eyes still glisten with tears.&gt;

Taivan... So this is his true gift. 

How could I have been so blind? He is different from other bakar, yes, but he has proven himself a valuable member of Clan Teerai. He will stay by my side for the rest of his days, rescuing who he can, and healing who I cannot.

Please, come and visit us anytime you'd like! We are both truly grateful for all you have done for us!</RewardText>
