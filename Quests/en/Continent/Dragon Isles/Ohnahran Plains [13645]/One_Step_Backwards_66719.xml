  <Title>One Step Backwards</Title>
  <Description>My friend, it is with great sorrow that I must say that I am familiar with the plight facing your kind in these ruins. If you proceed any further, you too will surely succumb to their madness.

Be it through your nurture or your nature, the call you hear is a physiological one. You have a craving that must be sated.

It brings me great shame to say that I possess the means to feed this malediction. It will not quite be the same, but you will be able to function... For now.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Protect yourself from The Call.</LogDescription>
