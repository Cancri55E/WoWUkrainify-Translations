  <Title>The Emissary's Arrival</Title>
  <Description>I will admit that I have not left the Emerald Gardens in all my life, and as such, I have never met a centaur, let alone a mortal from the mainland.

However, I am not here for a kindly visit, but rather to plead for the centaur's aid in securing our oathstone and protecting our charge.

I am glad to see you are here to help as well. There is much to discuss.</Description>
