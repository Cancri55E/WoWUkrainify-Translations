  <Description>If you're venturing out into the pines, please slay any stormtouched animals. This is not easy for me to ask, but they're clearly in pain, unable to be helped, and spreading the aggression.

I suspect it's the primalists' doing. It must be coming from their outpost nearby, where I saw a strange magical altar at work.

I'm going to go investigate again. If I'm not back by the time you return, Scout Watu can brief you on additional tasks. We're grateful for any help.</Description>
