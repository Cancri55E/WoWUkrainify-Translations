  <Title>A Chief of Legends</Title>
  <Description>The gorlocs of this swamp were once simple creatures. Pests, perhaps, but never raiders, thieves, or dog-eaters.

It is their chief, Grrlgllmesh, who has led them away from their nature.

Put an end to him, and the gorlocs will threaten us no more.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>The mightiest of gorlocs, Grrlgllmesh has nothing more to conquer but his own despair.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Kill Chief Grrlgllmesh.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>With their chieftain slain, the gorlocs will no longer bother us. 

I am astounded by how strong they became under Chief Grrlgllmesh.
