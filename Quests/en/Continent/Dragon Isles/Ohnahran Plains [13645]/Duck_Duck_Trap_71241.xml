  <Title>Duck, Duck, Trap</Title>
  <Description>The grove called the Primordial Vale is rich with the magic of the old dragons. A type of slyvern there are prized by my kin for their fur, but they are elusive and hard to find.

Instead of having you try to track them down, you can find some of our hunting traps in the area. Use meat from the nearby waterfowl to reset them - I will send some of our clan to retrieve whatever gets caught.</Description>
