  <Title>Pinewood Trail</Title>
  <Description>If Bovan is not dead, and he is not here, then either he is still out there... or he has been captured. Given Tomul's message, I fear it's the latter.

The Windtotem are safe for now, but with an attack possible at any moment, they can't spare any braves to go after Bovan.

It looks like it is up to us. Let us head to Pinewood Post.</Description>
