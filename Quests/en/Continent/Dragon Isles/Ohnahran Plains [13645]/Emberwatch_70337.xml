  <Title>Emberwatch</Title>
  <Description>Hail, outsider.

The winds tell me of a group taking shelter in the ruins of Emberwatch. They seem only interested in the past while we centaur choose to live for the present under the grace of Ohn'ahra.

Nonetheless, they are guests in our home. I have fashioned for them these wind chimes so they may hear Ohn'ahra's presence. May it bring their hearth some joy and comfort.</Description>
