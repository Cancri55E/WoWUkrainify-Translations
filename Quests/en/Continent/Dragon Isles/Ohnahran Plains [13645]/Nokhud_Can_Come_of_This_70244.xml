  <Description>For thousands of years, the Teerai have guarded the Horn of Drusahl, our most sacred relic. By sacking this village, Balakar has betrayed everything it means to be Maruuk. There can be no redemption for him now.

We must retake the Horn before Balakar can destroy it and rescue any Teerai who yet live. I am going with you to personally bring that false Khan to justice. The Nokhud will know the wrath of the Khanam Matra!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Enter the village with Khanam Matra Sarest and reclaim it from the Nokhud.</LogDescription>
