  <Title>Signs of the Wind</Title>
  <Description>When the elements, true primals of the world, challenged the centaur, Himia met them with our given gift. The wind.

A singing stone stands strong in the plains. There, you can offer tokens of the wind to evoke her memory. Such tokens may be found all around us--a bird's feather, a plant spore, a river's reeds.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather wind tokens and give them to the Offering Vessel near the singing stone.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;There are ashen remains of previously offered wind tokens in the iron container.&gt;

&lt;You place what you've gathered on top.&gt;</RewardText>
