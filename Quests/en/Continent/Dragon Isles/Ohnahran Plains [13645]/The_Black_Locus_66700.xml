  <Title>The Black Locus</Title>
  <Description>It really is quite enticing, isn't it? The Locus was too much for the Sundered Flame. However, it fits just right in my hands. Funny, that.

&lt;Adenedal shakes his head.&gt;

Perhaps not. Not this day. Not again. Take it from me. It is not my burden to bear.

Good bye, dear friend.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring the Black Locus to the Telemancer Aerilyn.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This was found at the Nelthazan Ruins? Fascinating. 

Its markings are ancient, but they bear a resemblance to other artifacts we have discovered in and around the ancient machinations of Deathwing.

Further study is necessary.</RewardText>
