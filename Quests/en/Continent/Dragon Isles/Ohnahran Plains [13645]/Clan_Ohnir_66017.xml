  <Title>Clan Ohn'ir</Title>
  <Description>&lt;As Sansok Khan signs, Okir vocalizes for her.&gt;

The mystics of our lands, like Ohn Seshteng, belong to Clan Ohn'ir. The clan is not made up of families, but rather of centaur from across the plains with an innate connection to Ohn'ahra. They spend their lives building that connection and honing their skills. Eventually, they receive assignments to advise different clans and protect our lands.

Ohn Seshteng went to speak with her khan about the omen she received. Join her to learn about the Ohn'ir.</Description>
