  <Title>The Field of Ferocity: Lost in the Dream!</Title>
  <Description>You know, for it being the Dragon Isles, I haven't seen too many dragons. We did get a duo of dragonkin that requested to be signed up for this competition together though.
 
They seem plenty eager to prove themselves though, so good luck!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defeat Sherath and Taresh.</LogDescription>

I'm guessing you won if you're standing in front of me?</RewardText>
