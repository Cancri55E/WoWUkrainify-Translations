  <Title>Tools of the Tirade</Title>
  <Description>Good. I was just thinking that I am in need of an adventurer like you. Strong. Sturdy. Willing to work for a trivial sum.

It is as if I willed you into existence. Well done, me. These ruins seem to have brought the attention of others. We cannot rely on them to excavate it properly. They will taint the samples!

Take this. Deploy it around artifacts of interest around the ruins. It is enchanted to perform any necessary duty.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deploy the enchanted tools to $1oa piles of rubble.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We will gather everything in time.</RewardText>
