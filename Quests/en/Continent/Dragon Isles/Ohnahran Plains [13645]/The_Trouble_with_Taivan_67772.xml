  <Title>The Trouble with Taivan</Title>
  <Description>Hello, friend. Welcome back to Maruukai. I am Selbekh, healer of Clan Teerai.

Are you good with animals, $n? Perhaps the influence of a newcomer is just what I need.

Taivan here, while a very good companion, has become something of a burden on my clan. I'm afraid if we can't find a good use for him, I may have to send him away. Will you help me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Healer Selbekh prepare Taivan for training.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>What brings you to the Shikaar hunting grounds, stranger?

The Teerai would like us to train your bakar as a hunter? We do not usually accept such requests from other clans, but I will consider it. Her gift is quite generous, and a fully-trained beast of his size would be a sight to behold. I bet he could take down a bull mammoth all on his own!

Hmm... I will have to see him in action before I make my decision.</RewardText>
