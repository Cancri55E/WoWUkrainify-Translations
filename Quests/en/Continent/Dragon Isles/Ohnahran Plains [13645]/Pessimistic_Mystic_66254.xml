  <Title>Pessimistic Mystic</Title>
  <Description>War? Dragons? You need me to contact Ohn'ahra?

I can't. I can't hear Ohn'ahra at all. I'm just an initiate, and it seems like Ohn'ahra has withdrawn her blessings from me. Maybe I'm not good enough...

&lt;Boku starts digging through a satchel.&gt;

When my mentor assigned me to this clan, she gifted me with these totems. She said they would empower me if ever I doubted myself.

Will you help me place them? I will try to call upon Ohn'ahra one more time.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place the Empowerment Totems around Boku.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Still nothing. Not even a sigh from Ohn'ahra.</RewardText>
