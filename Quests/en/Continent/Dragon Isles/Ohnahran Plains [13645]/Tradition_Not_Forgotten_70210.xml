  <Title>Tradition Not Forgotten</Title>
  <Description>One tradition for the Aylaag as we stay at this camp is for our members to make the pilgrimage to the Eternal Kurgans to ask for journeys safe from that which plagued our ancestors. The presence of the Nokhud has made this pilgrimage perilous.

If you do not mind, I would ask you would uphold our tradition for us.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place incense and clear out ghostly beasts from the Eternal Kurgans.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I owe you much. It is hard to ask an outsider for help with something so important to our clan, but I do not see another option.</RewardText>
