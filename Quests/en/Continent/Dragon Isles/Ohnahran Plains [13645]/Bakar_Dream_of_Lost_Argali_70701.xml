  <Title>Bakar Dream of Lost Argali</Title>
  <Description>Some of the clan's argali have wandered away from our flock again.

The ridge around us is too dangerous for our shepherds to search for them. It would be a great boon if you could take one of our bakar and bring back the argali. Our shepherds can point you in the right direction.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Herd the lost argali back to Clan Aylaag.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We must be vigilant about our livestock. We are limited in resources to begin with. To lose an argali is a setback we would much like to avoid.</RewardText>
