  <Title>Counting Sheep</Title>
  <Description>How frustrating. A rabid stag did this while my brother Olekk and I were scouting.

&lt;Watu gestures at his bloody leg and winces.&gt;

Are you here to help? After the primalists attacked, our herd of argali scattered into the pines. Their wool and milk are essential to the camp's functions.

Take this whistle, which commands Wish to herd the argali back home. Sondo the butcher has her favorite treats if she needs extra encouragement.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Befriend Wish with food, and use Wish's Whistle to save $3oa Lost Argali in the Sagecrest Pines.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So our argali live. Give Wish an extra pat for me, will you? I would do it myself, but I can't move. &lt;Watu sighs.&gt;</RewardText>
