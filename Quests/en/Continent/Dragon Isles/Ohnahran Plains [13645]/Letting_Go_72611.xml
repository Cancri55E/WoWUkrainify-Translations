  <Title>Letting Go</Title>
  <Description>The Shikaar lost two of their own during the battle. All of Tomul's reinforcements... they volunteered to help, of their own will.

I... have much to consider.

After speaking with the Shikaar, we decided to honor our dead together. We have blended our funerary rights into one ceremony for this occasion.

We would be honored if you would stay and participate.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Baine Bloodhoof about the funeral.</LogDescription>
