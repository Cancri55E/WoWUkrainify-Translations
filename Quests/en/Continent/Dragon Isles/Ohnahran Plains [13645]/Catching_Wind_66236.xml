  <Title>Catching Wind</Title>
  <Description>The Nokhud are collecting totems. The Primalists are capturing ohuna. And Ohn'ahra is silent.

Whatever the Nokhud plans are, we must foil them. You and Boku must travel to Windsong Rise. Our enemies are likely there already.

Search for Ohn'ahra there. If her children are in danger, she will undoubtedly go to them, and we must help. The Windmother is powerful, but I fear what these Primalists are capable of.</Description>
