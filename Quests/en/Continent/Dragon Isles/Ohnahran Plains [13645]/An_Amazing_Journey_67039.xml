  <Title>An Amazing Journey</Title>
  <Description>A few of the clan's pets ended up getting lost along the last journey between camps. They're not hunting animals so I doubt they can take care of themselves properly out there!

Do you think you could go search for them? They may not be hunting partners, but they're important members of the clan regardless!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find the missing animals.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>They all returned before you. Thank the winds!</RewardText>
