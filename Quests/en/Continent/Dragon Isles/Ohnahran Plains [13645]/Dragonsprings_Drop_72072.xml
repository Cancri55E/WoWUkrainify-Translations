  <Title>Dragonsprings Drop</Title>
  <Description>The fish could be biting better, don't you think?

You know, that gives me an idea. Legend says these lakes and rivers did not always have fish. They say, these watering holes were stocked with fish when the dragons soaring overhead dropped them! Can you believe it?

Maybe you and your drake could give it a try?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect fish to restock the fishing hole and mount your drake to drop them from above.</LogDescription>
