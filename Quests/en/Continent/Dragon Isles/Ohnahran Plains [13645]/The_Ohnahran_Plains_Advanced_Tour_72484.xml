  <Title>The Ohn'ahran Plains Advanced Tour</Title>
  <Description>The advanced courses should be more challenging, but I am sure it is nothing you cannot handle!

My bronze colleagues have set up advanced courses in the Ohn'ahran Plains that have a few obstacles and surprises thrown in them. You can also compete against your own best times!

Good luck!</Description>
