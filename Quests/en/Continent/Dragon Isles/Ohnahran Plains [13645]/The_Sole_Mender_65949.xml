  <Title>The Sole Mender</Title>
  <Description>When we join Ohn'ahra in the wind, we leave these medallions behind.

Although I helped craft this medallion, I am not its rightful owner.

It should be returned to Roscha. It is the last memory of her betrothed.

Take it to her so she may mourn and be at peace.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return the Medallion to Farrier Roscha.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Is this... ah. It is. My beloved is in the sky, then, running with Ohn'ahra. I will join her... in time.

Thank you, $p. 

I will remember what you have done for Clan Shikaar. And for me.</RewardText>
