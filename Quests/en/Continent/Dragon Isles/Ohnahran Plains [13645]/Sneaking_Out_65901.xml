  <Title>Sneaking Out</Title>
  <Description>I'm grounded indefinitely! Doesn't my Ohn know I'm turning sixteen next spring? I should be able to leave when I want to.

You look like you could help me out. I do have an escape plan: by channeling these totems, I'll concentrate the air and create quite a stir. But I can't go around placing them, because I'm under maximum wind watch. Even Togo won't help me.

But with your help... Please! I promise I'll show you something cool.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place the air totems in Ohn'iri Springs and then inform Radiya.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Meet up with Radiya by the Mirror of the Sky.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Whew, thank you! Freedom!</RewardText>
