  <Title>An Opportunistic Approach</Title>
  <Description>The Shikaar have formed an offensive line against the Nokhud to the north. While I do not like stooping to scavenging, it is unfortunately a necessary evil for our supplies. Brave the battlefield and return with weapons, and I will reward your efforts.

If you could focus said efforts on the Nokhud side of the line, perhaps the ancestors will judge me less harshly.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve weapons and slay Nokhud forces at the Nokhud Approach.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ancestors forgive me. If I were stronger, we would not need to resort to such a questionable method for resources.</RewardText>
