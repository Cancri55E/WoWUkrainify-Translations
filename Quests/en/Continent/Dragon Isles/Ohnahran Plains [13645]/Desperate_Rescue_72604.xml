  <Title>Desperate Rescue</Title>
  <Description>I should have known I could not trust the centaur. They may provide token amounts of aid, but they would never risk themselves for us.

Let us focus on the matter at hand. We cannot allow Bovan to remain in centaur captivity! I will set out immediately for Nokhudon Hold. 

Meet me there as quickly as you can.</Description>
