  <Title>Suspiciously Spiced Steak</Title>
  <Description>My sister's idea is charming, but Theramus needs a real pick-me-up.

That would be a generous serving of sourbloom. We can make it into a paste to slather onto his favorite food: turtle meat!

Will you help me collect the ingredients?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Perfectly Tender Turtle Meat, $2oa Reptilian Eggshells, and $3oa Sourbloom.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The meat to sourbloom ratio is just right.</RewardText>
