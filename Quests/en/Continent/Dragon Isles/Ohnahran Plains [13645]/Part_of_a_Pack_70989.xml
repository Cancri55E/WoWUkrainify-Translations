  <Title>Part of a Pack</Title>
  <Description>Perhaps your bakar needs to be shown the proper way to hunt by his own kind.

You may borrow some of our trained bakar. Take them and bring down the drake that circles the area. 

Let us see how Taivan behaves in a pack!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Hunt the Ravenous Proto-Drake with Taivan and the pack of hunting bakar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Jadar shakes his head.&gt;

Very disappointing. I'm afraid Taivan just does not have it in him to hunt like a Shikaar. Even with other bakar fighting beside him, he could not shake his unwillingness to attack his enemy. 

What a waste!</RewardText>
