  <Title>The Nelthazan Ruins</Title>
  <Description>The Dragonscale Expedition requires your assistance.

A skyscribe was sent to the ruins to gather information. They should be uninhabited, but I can hear his shouting from over here.

He must be in dire circumstances for it to be audible at this distance.

On this expedition, we take care of our own. Even the insufferable ones. Seek him out and protect him from whatever danger he has found.</Description>
