  <Title>A Tomul-tuous Beginning</Title>
  <Description>Since the dragons returned, we've seen an overwhelming number of outsiders passing through the plains. Normally we keep a close eye on our borders, but their sheer numbers, combined with the Nokhud threat, have made it difficult to track them.

One scout reported a group of outsiders that matched your description traveling along the eastern road. We should start our search there.

As for your friend, my khan gave me a command. A huffy companion won't stop me from carrying it out.</Description>
