  <Title>Joint Rescue Operation</Title>
  <Description>Tomul says the attacks on the Windtotem were carried out by an enemy clan known as the Nokhud. 

Just down this road is their closest outpost, and the most likely location where tauren prisoners would be taken.

The task is simple--rescue the captives. We do not know how many there are, or how long they have been here, so we must hurry.

I speak from experience when I say centaur do not keep their captives for long.</Description>
