  <Title>Mysterious Beast</Title>
  <Description>&lt;You find a large pawprint sunk into the dirt. Looking around, none of the nearby creatures have paws, let alone of that size.

Perhaps the centaur will be impressed if you hunt this great beast.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find and slay the beast, then bring back proof to Scout Tomul.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Bring the Pelt of Konkhular to Scout Tomul.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>&lt;Tomul looks the pelt over before offering a small nod.&gt;

You defeated Konkhular, then. Not bad, two foot. He has evaded our hunters for many moons. His pelt always blended in well with his surroundings. Perhaps now our hunters can use his camouflage to their own advantage.</RewardText>
