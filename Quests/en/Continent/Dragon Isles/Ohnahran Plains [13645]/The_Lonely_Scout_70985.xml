  <Title>The Lonely Scout</Title>
  <Description>I know, I know, it's silly. A centaur and a dryad, right? We can't be more different.

But ever since I first laid eyes on the Emerald Gardens, I really have wanted to get to know one better. I just can't seem to say or do anything to keep them interested in me.

I've heard they're into... plants. And cute baby animals. And maybe killing poachers, but I don't even know where to start.

Please, you can talk to them, right? Could you ask around and find out what they like? Then maybe I can have a shot.</Description>
