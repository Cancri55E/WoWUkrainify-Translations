  <Title>Boku the Mystic</Title>
  <Description>The mystics were called away to Ridgewater Retreat a few days ago, but one mystic remains. His name is Boku. He can be found on top of the hill at the Ohn'ahran shrine.

He's just an initiate, but he should be able to commune with Ohn'ahra and acquire her blessing. With Ohn'ahra on our side, we might be able to win this war before it starts.</Description>
