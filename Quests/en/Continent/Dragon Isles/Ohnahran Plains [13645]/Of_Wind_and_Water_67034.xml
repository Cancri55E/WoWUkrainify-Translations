  <Description>To the east is a great dragonspring which serves as a nesting area for wild eagles. The feathers they shed still contain their magic for quite some time and are used in many rituals.

The area also hosts raging spirits of the elements, and their cores are of some use as well.

Bring a collection of both back to me - and remember that the eagles are sacred, I will not accept feathers that are gathered from their harm.</Description>
