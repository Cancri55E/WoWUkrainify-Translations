  <Title>Nergazurai</Title>
  <Description>My uncle told me many tales of his battle with a hornstrider named Nergazurai. He told me of its fuchsia scales weaving through the hills of the plains as it seeks its prey, its razor-sharp talons and venomous bite.

While I was out hunting I saw the flash, but it was too late; it left me with a nasty bite in my shoulder. He was as terrible as my uncle described, but I came out alive.

I need to clean the infection from his bite. Please, collect the reagents I need. Time is of the essence.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring an Ottuk Heart, a Rockfang Femur, a Hornstrider Scale, and a Vulture Gizzard to Muqur Rain-Touched in Timberstep Outpost.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you. With these reagents I should be able to stop the infection from spreading, then hopefully clear it completely. I owe you a life-debt.

Be wary of Negazurai, traveler. His thirst for blood is unyielding.</RewardText>
