  <Description>I'm sure I can find this Bovan Windtotem--but I will need a few items from you.

First, I need a selection of flowers that grow at the base of the springs. They have the specific properties we are looking for.

Next, I require the heart of a salamanther. A stronger heart will better our chances--look for the strongest you can find!

I can gather the rest of the materials on my own.</Description>
