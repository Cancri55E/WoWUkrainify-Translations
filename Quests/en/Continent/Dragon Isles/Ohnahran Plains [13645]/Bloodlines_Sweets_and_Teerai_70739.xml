  <Title>Bloodlines, Sweets, and Teerai</Title>
  <Description>I have hunted with khans, outrun our fastest bakar, and wrestled a full grown bruffalon bull bare-handed. As a hunter, I've nothing left to prove.

However, as a partner, I still have much to learn. 

Windsage Dawa of Clan Ohn'ir is my heart and my joy. I wish only to prove worthy of his love, but I know nothing of traditions and rituals. I require the wisdom of the elders in Maruukai.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Hunter Narman earn a traditional blessing for his marriage proposal.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak to Hunter Narman at the Shikaar rise in Maruukai.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>I would sooner ask all the stars of the night sky to admire me back than claim to be wholly worthy of Dawa's love.

Nonetheless, I will find the courage to proceed. When the time comes, will you assist me with a grand proposal?</RewardText>
