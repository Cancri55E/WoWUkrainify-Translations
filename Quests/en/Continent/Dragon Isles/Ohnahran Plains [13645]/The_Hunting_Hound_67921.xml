  <Title>The Hunting Hound</Title>
  <Description>Go and hunt the nearby beasts with your giant bakar. The bigger, the better. I will observe from here, and decide if he is worthy of Shikaar training. 

Be warned, I will only accept the best.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Hunt dangerous beasts with Taivan to prove he is worthy of training.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Your bakar, while massive and strong, does not seem to have the will to do what needs to be done in the hunt. He is too soft!

I will give him one more chance, but this is it!</RewardText>
