  <Title>The Keys You Need</Title>
  <Description>Can I trust you? These are the only keys we have. If we lose them, we can't open any locked doors.

Here. Take them. Use them on the doors within this chamber. You look like a hero. Be bold! Throw those doors wide! You'll find glory or... um... something that is not glory but is still amazing! Just don't die.

We might find more, but we'll have to search the island to find them.</Description>
