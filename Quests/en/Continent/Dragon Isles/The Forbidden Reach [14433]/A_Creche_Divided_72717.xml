  <Title>A Creche Divided</Title>
  <Description>This place... I have not been here for a long time. Not since before I was a Scalecommander. 

It is a dark place, full of pain... and failure. 

This was where Neltharion tested those he considered most worthy of his attention. He poked and prodded us with powers we could not understand or control.

Many of us were found... wanting.

Perhaps Sarkareth brought me here to test me the same way our father tested us.

Will you walk with me?</Description>
