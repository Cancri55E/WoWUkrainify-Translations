  <Title>Plunder Siege</Title>
  <Description>We're not the only ones to have noticed the storms abating over the Forbidden Reach. 

Other interested parties have arrived too, looting everything they can and storing their spoils in chests. If they use Neltharion's old hoard chests, they're in for a surprise when the chests' enchantments lock them out. We'll need to clear out surrounding looters to break the chests' enchantments.

See if you can recover a stolen item, specifically my old journal. It's nowhere to be found.</Description>
