  <Title>Zskera Vault: Az</Title>
  <Description>We have discovered a series of vaults below the island. Neltharion hoarded treasures, accumulated knickknacks, and stashed away the results of his failed experiments.

When I say he's a hoarder, I'm not kidding! He filled chamber after chamber, and in time, they were all forgotten... until now. Treasure awaits us behind these locked doors! Also, the occasional deathtrap. Also, treasure! Now we have the keys to unlock those doors.</Description>
