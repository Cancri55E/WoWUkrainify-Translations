  <Title>Spelunking the Den</Title>
  <Description>Did you have a chance to visit the Skyfox Den? A very exciting place, from what I've heard. Expedition's spelunkers started surveying the cave and even installed a few grappling hooks on the ceiling, but they were scared away by violent slyverns.

Can you do me a favor? Get inside the Skyfox Den, grab the abandoned gear, and check the ceiling for any hidden crevices. Who knows what could be hidden inside?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Explore the Skyfox Den's ceiling using Dragonscale Expedition climbing gear inside the cave.</LogDescription>
