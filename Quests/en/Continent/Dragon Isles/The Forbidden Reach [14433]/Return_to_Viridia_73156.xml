  <Title>Return to Viridia</Title>
  <Description>I should entrust you to Viridia. She's working with the Healing Wings in Morqut Village to build a safe place for the dracthyr, the tuskarr, and our other allies in the Reach.

We have a home here... and I... I have some thinking to do. I'm grateful that you walked beside me through this trial.

This isn't over. But at least I know that the next time we face Sarkareth, we can count on you. Thank you.</Description>
