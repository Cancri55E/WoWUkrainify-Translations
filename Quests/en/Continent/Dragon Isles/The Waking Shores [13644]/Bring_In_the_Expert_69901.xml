  <Description>Did Iyali say how long this creature has been suffering? If it's too injured to eat, we need to treat it quickly.

Normally a Dragonscale Expedition camp would have everything I need to help this whelp, but getting supplies to the "frontier" here on the Dragon Isles has proven tricky. There have been significant delays in our supply routes.

But, fear not. The land itself will provide! If you bring me Sunlight Flowers, I can craft a soothing balm that will calm the drake so I can heal it.</Description>
