  <Description>I've worked with many elementals as a shaman, but I've never seen any this aggressive!

The Expedition discovered a titan vault here, but a barrier protects the inner chamber. When we tried to dispel the barrier, I think we triggered some kind of security system... There were suddenly angry elementals everywhere!

Many explorers were working in the dig site when the elementals attacked. Many of them are trapped, and NONE of them are fighters. 

Please go down into the dig site and help them retreat!</Description>
