  <Title>From Such Great Heights</Title>
  <Description>Toddy and Naleidea have requested a survey report of the surrounding area immediately.

Luckily, I have acquired an enchanted telescope and surveyor's disc that will help us scout out nearby areas from the safety of the clouds.

Unluckily, I am deathly afraid of heights and cannot bring myself to set foot on the contraption.

You are not afraid of heights, are you?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Surveyor's Disc to bounce into the sky and scout the area.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Aster breathes a sigh of relief.&gt;

I thought for certain you would plummet to your death from up there. Thanks again for taking the risk so that I was not required to.</RewardText>
