  <Title>Dragonriding</Title>
  <Description>One thing you may have already discovered about this place: the Dragon Isles are vast. 

Some of the drakes have an intense interest in exploring every corner and secret hiding place in this renewed land, even those places that are not readily reached from the ground. They are eager for a second set of eyes to aid them in their journey, and in trade will gladly bear a rider across the lands.

Speak with Lord Andestrasz, here in the Ruby Lifeshrine. He will explain more of what they intend.</Description>
