  <Title>The Life of Spice</Title>
  <Description>To many, meat is essential for any true meal. But what is the essential for any true meat dish?

Spice!!

A spice that surpasses all others in terms of flavor, texture, and rarity lies within these Isles. Unfortunately, it can only be found on elementals that dwell in the depths of the Obsidian Stronghold. It's an area currently occupied by the Djaradin.

Perhaps you can consult with a peculiar troll I met while passing through there. I believe his name was... Griftah.</Description>
