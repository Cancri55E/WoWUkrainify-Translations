  <Description>I may not know anything about water elementals, but I do know hornstriders!

I've thrown together a salve that'll keep the 'striders healthy and ready to fight. I've never had a chance to apply it to a real hornstrider, but I've done all the studying I can do.

It's time to put on a brave face and lather them up!</Description>
