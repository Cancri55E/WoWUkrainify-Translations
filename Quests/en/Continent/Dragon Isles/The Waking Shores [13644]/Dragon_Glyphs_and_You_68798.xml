  <Title>Dragon Glyphs and You</Title>
  <Description>Obviously, it is not just Glensera and myself that are invested in these adventurers. Lithragosa is also excited to help you hone your dragonriding skills, and you have already met Celormu which is excellent.

There are glyphs around the Dragon Isles that will help you learn more tricks and abilities for dragonriding. In fact, there is one right here in the Skytop Observatory.

Once you find it, Lithragosa can help you use it!</Description>
