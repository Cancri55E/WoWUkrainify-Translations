  <Title>Artisan's Supply: Lava Beetles</Title>
  <Description>Are you looking for work, herbalist? The Artisan's Consortium asked me to gather some beetles for their customers.

The land is plentiful, but not so much that I can simply step away and be back with their request.

But if you venture out, perhaps you could collect a few beetles on your way?</Description>
