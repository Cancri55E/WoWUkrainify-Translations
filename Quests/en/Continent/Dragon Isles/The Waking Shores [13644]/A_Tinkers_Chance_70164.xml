  <Title>A Tinker's Chance</Title>
  <Description>If you have a moment, $p, I am close to a breakthrough!

After the creche collapsed, I lost more than my ability to fight. I lost my identity as a dracthyr. Perhaps you can understand.

I have always enjoyed putting things together and taking them apart, so Expedition seemed like a good fit for me. But this artifact is giving me some trouble.

Would you ask Phosildral and Sibrit to review my notes? I want to prove I am a capable tinker... to them and to myself.</Description>
