  <Title>Artisan's Supply: Dragon's Alchemical Solution</Title>
  <Description>Are you looking for work, alchemist?

The Artisan's Consortium has reached out to me with a "crafting order" for my alchemical solutions. I am as curious as the next dragonkin to find out more about these business practices, but I am simply too busy.

Perhaps this is an opportunity for you, my apprentice. Create some alchemical solution by reclaiming your earlier concoctions, and bring it to Haephesta, just down the path.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Reclaim Concoctions recipe to create $1oa bottles of Dragon's Alchemical Solution for Haephesta at the Ruby Lifeshrine.</LogDescription>
