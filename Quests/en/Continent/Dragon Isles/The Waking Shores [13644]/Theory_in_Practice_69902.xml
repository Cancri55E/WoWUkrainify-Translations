  <Description>$n, I require your assistance...

I hope no one was expecting me to craft, subdue the whelp, heal, and teach these children all at once! Multitasking like that is certainly overrated. 

Now, you can start by using those flowers. I'll need a couple minutes to prepare myself to heal the proto-whelp. 

Hopefully, the children will find this incident... instructional.</Description>
