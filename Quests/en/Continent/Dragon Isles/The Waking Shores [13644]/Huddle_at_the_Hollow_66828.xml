  <Title>Huddle at the Hollow</Title>
  <Description>I've never seen Akora this upset. Usually she's as sunny as her flowers, but that legend means a lot to her. She talks about it all the time. Hm...

&lt;Keshki fidgets with their glasses.&gt;

I don't know a lot about plants, and I don't think frogs would cheer up anyone but me...

But north of here there's a quiet spot where I do my thinking: Hornswog Hollow. Maybe we can find something to cheer her up there? Or, uh, try to formulate a plan to help?</Description>
