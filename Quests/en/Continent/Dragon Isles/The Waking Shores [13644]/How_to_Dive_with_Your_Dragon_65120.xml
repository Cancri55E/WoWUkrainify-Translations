  <Title>How to Dive with Your Dragon</Title>
  <Description>Gliding will get you to where you want to go. But what if you want to get there faster?

Diving after jumping from somewhere high will give you a speed boost.

Fly through the rings to the target location.

If you find yourself stuck, use the Bronze Timepiece and Celormu will reset you.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Dive then glide through the rings and land in the target area.</LogDescription>

If you start your flights with a dive you will get to where you want to go so much faster.</RewardText>
