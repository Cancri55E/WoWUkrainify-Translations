  <Description>Judging by what the children have said, we might have a primalist prowling the Wild Preserve.

This calls for immediate investigation.

According to what other researchers have observed, Primalists like to steal eggs and whelps to infuse them with power and corrupt them. Those that don't acclimate to the process suffer a slow death... not that the primalists seem to care...

We need them out of the Preserve. Attend to that, and I will try to distract the children. They must not know of this.</Description>
