  <Title>Artisan's Supply: Quality-Assured Optics</Title>
  <Description>Ah, an engineer! Excellent timing.

I've got some schematics to fix, but some tall lady came by asking for a set of optics.

You know how to make those, right?

Take 'em to the Ruby Lifeshrine when you have 'em crafted. I think she said she was with the Artisan's Consortium or something.</Description>
