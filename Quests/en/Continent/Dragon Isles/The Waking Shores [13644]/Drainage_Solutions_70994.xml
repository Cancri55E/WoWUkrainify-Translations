  <Description>Want the honor of assisting world-renowned Head Geologist of the Dragonscale Expedition? That's right. I'm exactly who you think I am. And I'm in a bind!

I was perusing this river for new sedimentary samples, but then the water started to walk away with the most interesting pieces of silt!

I have here my patented water entrapment device, but it's in desperate need of someone to march around and siphon those elementals into it.

Think you're up to the task?</Description>
