  <Description>Thank you for listening to me, young one. I have a favor to ask. 

Don't worry. No more stories.

When we left this place, I left a... time capsule of sorts. Would you... would you be able to retrieve it for me? We left it at the bottom of the Ruby Life Shrine, hidden behind one of the pillars.

I hid it with a sigil. If you activate it, you should see my time capsule.</Description>
