  <Title>A Two for One Deal</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, adventurer! Say, you look like a capable person. Could you give me a hand?

Azkra and I are charged with watching over this tower, which is in what I like to call "an exciting state of pre-renovation." My problem is as we started repairs, the local earth elementals attacked us! 

So I thought "Zefren, why not take care of the earth elementals and get some building materials at the same time?" Which is where you come in! Could you help?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain Building Materials from the local Earth Elementals.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Oh bother, these are quite a bit more crumbly than I was expecting. They look quite a lot more solid when they are launched at your head! 

Well. I'm sure I can use these for building regardless, thank you for your help! 

Maybe there are some mud elementals around here somewhere I can use to glue it together....</RewardText>
