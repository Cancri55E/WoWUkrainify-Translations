  <Description>So, you want to be a seasoned cataloger like me? You've come to the right place! 

The Wild Preserve is teeming with knowledge waiting to be found and filed! And how do I do that you ask? Why, with my handy Catalog-izer 3000 Dragon Isles edition--now with improved motion capture!

To gain experience, photograph a proto-dragon egg, a whelp learning to fly, and a hunting proto-drake. Meet me at the ancient, proto-dragon skeleton west of here, and I'll assess your photos.</Description>
