  <Description>Kad'irsza is reckless, but she knows her crabs. The gorlocs have gone too far!

I noticed the gorlocs going to Gurblbrblr for everything. Notably, he is instructing them to take crabs prisoner. We cannot allow this to continue, for the balance of life, and for the safety of those who tend it.

Defeat Gurblbrblr. Remove their means of expanding beyond this river!</Description>
