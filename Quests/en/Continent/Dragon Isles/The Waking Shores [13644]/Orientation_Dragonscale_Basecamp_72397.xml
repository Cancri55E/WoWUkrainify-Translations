  <Title>Orientation: Dragonscale Basecamp</Title>
  <Description>Welcome to basecamp, $p.

It took Toddy and me awhile to settle on the perfect site to establish camp, but I couldn't be happier with our selection.

Easy access to ruins, proto-dragon breeding grounds, and of course the dragonflights.

Why not take a few minutes to explore the camp and meet some of the suppliers helping to fuel the expedition?</Description>
