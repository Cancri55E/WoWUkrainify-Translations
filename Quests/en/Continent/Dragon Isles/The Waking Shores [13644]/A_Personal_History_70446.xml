  <Title>A Personal History</Title>
  <Description>In delving into the archives here, I've found threads that point towards the Obsidian Observatory as a place of personal importance to the Earth-Warder. I can only guess what knowledge it may contain about the history of our flight.

Given Emberthal's interest in the subject, I informed her of my discovery. I pray that wasn't a mistake.

She has gone ahead to scout. Please, keep an eye on her. She is a competent soldier, but this subject is... troubling. Who knows what truths you may uncover.</Description>
