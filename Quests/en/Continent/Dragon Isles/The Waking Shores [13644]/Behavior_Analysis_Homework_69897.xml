  <Title>Behavior Analysis "Homework"</Title>
  <Description>I need to talk to someone who knows proto-whelps. Like the ones that live in the Wild Preserve! 

Are they as angry as the big ones? Do they bite or breathe fire at you?

What if I... er... you petted a proto-whelp? Would they know that you're nice and trying to help them?

I'm asking for science, of course. Tyrgon always tells us to test our hippa... no... hypo... hmph! Hyppotatotoast... ugh! THEORIES!

I think they would like petting and it would make them feel good. Could you test that for me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Pet $4oa Sleeping Whelps and report back to Iyali.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So, some proto-whelps like to be petted, but some don't? 

That's not good. What if this one calls its friends? Or what if it's mean? 

I mean, this lesson, uh, makes no sense! This, uh, homework is very difficult. 

Thank you for helping me. I'm sorry if you got hurt...</RewardText>
