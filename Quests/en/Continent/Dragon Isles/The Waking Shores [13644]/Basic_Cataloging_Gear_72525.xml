  <Title>Basic Cataloging Gear</Title>
  <Description>Every expedition cataloger deserves their very own camera!

You don't need to give yours a special name, but I highly encourage it. It's far more fun.

Anyway, Pathfinder Jeb should be able to get you everything you need.

I've yet to need a single thing that he hasn't brought along with him. He's incredible!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Expedition Supply Kit to research Cataloging Gear.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Oh, your new camera is beautiful. It matches you perfectly!</RewardText>
