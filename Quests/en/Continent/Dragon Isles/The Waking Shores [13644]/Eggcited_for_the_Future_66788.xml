  <Title>Egg-cited for the Future</Title>
  <Description>I can scarcely believe it! Eggs of the Black Dragonflight! After all this time!

But look at the state of this place! It will not do at all! Nothing is too good for these eggs.

Though with those two blowhards squabbling like children for the Life-Binder's favor, you can bet they have not spared a thought for us! You, though, will not leave an old egg tender all alone, will you?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Mother Elion restore the area.</LogDescription>
