  <Title>Untold Regrets</Title>
  <Description>Duroz is old, sick, and stubborn as a kodo. There was no stopping him getting on the airship to come here. Best I could do was come be his walking stick.

I've seen him in pain enough times on the battlefield to know when he's hiding it. He's been getting worse every day out here. Can you help me get him to the potion makers? Ale's not doing the trick anymore. 

If you can carry our weapons, I can help him walk.</Description>
