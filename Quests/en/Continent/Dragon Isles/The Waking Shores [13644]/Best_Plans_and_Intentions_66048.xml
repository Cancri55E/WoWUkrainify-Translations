  <Title>Best Plans and Intentions</Title>
  <Description>Attacking the djaradin controlling the Obsidian Citadel will be no easy task. Even with Wrathion and his Blacktalon forces, this will be a fierce battle. Wrathion may be confident, but... I am not so certain.

Perhaps we can speak to those helping to plan the strategy, and see if we can find any room for improvement.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Review the plans with the various members of Wrathion's forces.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Report your findings to Wrathion at the Obsidian Bulwark.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>I see. I shall consider your evaluation carefully, of course.</RewardText>
