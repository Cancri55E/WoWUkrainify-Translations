  <Title>Where is Wrathion?</Title>
  <Description>How unusual.

Ebyssian told us that Wrathion would be awaiting our arrival along with an ambassador for Alexstrasza the Life-Binder, Queen of the Dragons.

It isn't like a dragon to break a promise.

At least this eager drakonid is here to greet us. Would you kindly inquire into when the others shall arrive?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ask Sendrax when the dragons are expected to arrive.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I do not know! As I said, this is my first assignment... Let me think on what to do.</RewardText>
