  <Title>Pain Management</Title>
  <Description>It is a good thing you brought him here when you did. I can tell he is in a great deal of pain, though he bears it well. So must we all when it comes time.

I am afraid that it is age that ails him and not illness, but I may be able to relieve some portion of his suffering.

Would you mind gathering some snapflowers, shallowlilies, and pure water from the garden nearby? I can create a pain medicine with these components, if you find enough.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather $1oa Milky Snapflowers, $2oa Blooming Shallowlilies, and a Filled Life Pools Vial.</LogDescription>
