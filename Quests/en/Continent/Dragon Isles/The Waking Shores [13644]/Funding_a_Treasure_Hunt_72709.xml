  <Title>Funding a Treasure Hunt</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Cataloger Jakes quickly flips through her own supply bag and pulls out a freshly drawn map.&gt;

One of our archeologists just reported some new findings in regards to a lost artifact, suspected to be in this area.

If you'll donate those supplies to fund the archeologist's next expedition, you can have this map that points to a nearby treasure.</Description>
