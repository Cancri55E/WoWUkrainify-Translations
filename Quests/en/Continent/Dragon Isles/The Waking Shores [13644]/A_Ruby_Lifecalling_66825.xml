  <Title>A Ruby Lifecalling</Title>
  <Description>$p! How fortunate you are here! We are about to begin a Lifecalling Ceremony and would be honored if you assisted us. 

A dragonspawn's Calling is very special. Some become masterful gardeners; others care for particular wildlife.

These young dragonspawn have finished their training and are ready to take on their first Callings. I know they would be thrilled to have you participate. When you're ready, please present each of the items on this table to them.</Description>
