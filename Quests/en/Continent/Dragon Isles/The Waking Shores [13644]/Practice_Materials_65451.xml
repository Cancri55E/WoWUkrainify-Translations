  <Description>These proto-drakes are unlike any I've seen before on Azeroth.

Their scales appear to be naturally flame-resistant, stronger than steel, and don't lose flexibility in the process. Incredible. 

My artisans--all of them--are clamoring to get their hands on some of those scales to work with.

Start with the whelps. The smaller scales should be more pliable until we've mastered our techniques with them.</Description>
