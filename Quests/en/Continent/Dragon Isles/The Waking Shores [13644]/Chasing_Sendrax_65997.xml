  <Title>Chasing Sendrax</Title>
  <Description>Cadet Sendrax came through here not long ago.

She relayed Commander Lethanak's orders for all drakonid to rally back at the Life Pools. Our whole defensive regiment set off in that direction not long after.

But our scouts were out on patrol in the old ruins, so she headed in there to rally them too.</Description>
