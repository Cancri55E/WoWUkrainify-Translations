  <Title>Hornswoggled!</Title>
  <Description>Oh, those hornswogs make me so mad!

&lt;Keshki stomps her foot angrily, knocking her glasses askew&gt;

They're big, greedy bullies! Just because the place is named after them doesn't mean they get to jump all around and eat everything smaller than them!

Here, use my jar of fireflies--it's a frog-minder's best friend. It'll calm the frogs enough that you can collect them, and we can get them out of harm's way.

And if any hornswogs get in your way, don't be afraid to bully them back!</Description>
