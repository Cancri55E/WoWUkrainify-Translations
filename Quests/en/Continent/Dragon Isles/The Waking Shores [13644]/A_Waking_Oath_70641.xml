  <Title>A Waking Oath</Title>
  <Description>Hold a moment, $p. I wish to personally thank you for your aid in restoring our oathstone.

I was not aware of the dracthyr until your reawakening on the Forbidden Reach. It was unclear what your arrival among us meant. Whether your kind would prove to be a boon to the defense of life... or a bane.

I would encourage you to learn more about our oathstone. Speak with a few of my flight here at the Ruby Lifeshrine. Perhaps you will find familiarity among our tales.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with members of the red dragonflight around the Ruby Lifeshrine.</LogDescription>
