  <Title>Deluge Dilemma</Title>
  <Description>Elementals are killing the hornstriders! I know how to wrangle large critters, but I never thought I'd have to go toe-to-toe with an elemental! These aren't anything like baby thunder lizards...

&lt;Dazakros sighs, distressed.&gt;

Please knock down a few of them elementals. Hornstriders have a lot more sense than we give them credit for. They'll fight back if they have the means to!</Description>
