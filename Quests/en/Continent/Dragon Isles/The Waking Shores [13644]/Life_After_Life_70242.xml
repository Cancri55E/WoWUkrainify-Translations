  <Description>I could sense that his friend bore a deep scar. Something in this place reopened it--perhaps so that it could heal cleanly this time.

Now it is Kolgar's time to heal.

In the terrace above us, you will find my friend Trellain working with the enchanters. Tell him that I require one of the vessels he uses in his work. He will give it to you freely.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect an Inert Vessel from Trellain in the Ruby Lifeshrine.</LogDescription>
