  <Title>Garden Party</Title>
  <Description>I've been tending to this garden for years, preparing for the day I'd finally accept my Lifecalling. Now that day is here!

I love flowers and all trees and plants--even the bugs that live amongst them. I can feel nature's spirit--the Great Dragon Spirit--when I tend the garden.

There's only one thing left to do. I'm going to invoke Great Dragon Spirit, just like the legends.

&lt;Akora smiles brightly.&gt;

Meet me down in the garden by the pool where her bones rest. I'll explain more there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Akora in the Ruby Life Pools.</LogDescription>
