  <Description>Our efforts have created everything we need to open an Earth-Warder's Vault. There are several beneath the Citadel. Locate one and I will reward you.

I have crafted chains to help move it. If you bring the Vault here, we can share in the riches.

Watch for the Vault being moved, as I have dispatched others to find them as well.</Description>
