  <Title>Fighting Fire with... Water</Title>
  <Description>In all my years of tending to the lava elementals, I have never seen them act like this! We can barely keep them contained to the cave.

Do you have a minute to spare? We'll hold the exit while you thin their numbers inside.

Here, take this bottled water elemental with you.

I always carry a few spare bottled water elementals when I'm looking after the lava elementals. Natural enemies make for good distractions!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill lava elementals in the Erupting Cavern.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you for a moment's respite. A caretaker's work is never done.</RewardText>
