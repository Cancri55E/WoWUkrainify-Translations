  <Description>The green dragonflight requires your aid now, hero. My sister's daughter and her flight have entered the Emerald Dream in an attempt to empower their own oathstone, but we have heard nothing since their slumber began.

Seek out the centaur that rule over the Ohn'ahran Plains. You may well need their connection to the land and its spirits if you are to rouse the greens.
