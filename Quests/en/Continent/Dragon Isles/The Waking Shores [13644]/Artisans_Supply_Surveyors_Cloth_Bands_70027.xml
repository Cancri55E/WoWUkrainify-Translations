  <Title>Artisan's Supply: Surveyor's Cloth Bands</Title>
  <Description>Are you looking for work, tailor? The Artisan's Consortium asked me to craft some wristbands for their customers.

While I appreciate that these explorers are trying to involve themselves with our weaving, I do not have time for such requests.

Perhaps you would be interested in taking on this project?</Description>
