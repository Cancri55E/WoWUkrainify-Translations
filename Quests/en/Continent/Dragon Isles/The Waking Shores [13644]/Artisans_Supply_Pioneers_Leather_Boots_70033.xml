  <Title>Artisan's Supply: Pioneer's Leather Boots</Title>
  <Description>Are you looking for work, leatherworker? The Artisan's Consortium asked me to craft some boots for their customers.

Clearly they don't understand my popularity. Do you know how many explorers have come through today complaining of holes in their shoes?

If you have the time, take these measurements. Perhaps this Artisan's Consortium could be a promising business opportunity for you.</Description>
