  <Title>Otter Devastation</Title>
  <Description>Hey there, friend. These here ottuks keep stealin' my catch!

Personally, I'd blow 'em up, but our Tuskarr friends don't seem too keen on that action. I made this here Ottuk Deterent Device MK-SH4RK, but... I aint a great swimmer.

You seem like you got the goods, why don't ya do us all a favor, activate the device, swimmy-swim around over there, and scare 'em off?</Description>
