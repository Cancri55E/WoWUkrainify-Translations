  <Title>Where is Wrathion?</Title>
  <Description>Hm, wonder where Wrathion is?

He said he'd be here waitin' for us with an ambassador for Alexstrasza the Life-Binder, Queen of the Dragons.

It does nae seem like a dragon to break a promise.

Well! At least this eager wee drakonid is here to welcome us. Can you talk to 'em and find out when the others are gonna arrive?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ask Sendrax when the dragons are expected to arrive.</LogDescription>
