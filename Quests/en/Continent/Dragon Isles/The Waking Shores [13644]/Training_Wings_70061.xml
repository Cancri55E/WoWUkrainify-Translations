  <Description>The dragons were gone from the Isles for quite some time, $p. To tell the truth... some of our skills have atrophied as they were passed down from generation to generation.

These whelps should be easy to teach, yet we are having some trouble wrangling them.

Say.

I have seen that even Majordomo Selistra trusts you with the most crucial tasks. Would you lend us your aid and help one of our young?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Guide a whelp to eliminate $2oa Agitated Weedlings, $3oa Intrusive Pupstingers, and $4oa Relentless Gust.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It is good to see our young flying with such joy and liberty in their hearts. Thank you for helping them achieve that.</RewardText>
