  <Title>Time for a Reckoning</Title>
  <Description>Cadet Sendrax has informed me of our majordomo's plans. Thank the Life-Binder that we have their help. Their interference gives us the reprieve we need to get our wounded back to the Life Pools to be treated.

I wish I could reinforce Selistra but I must keep my guards near the wounded. Go to the enemy stronghold to meet them. 

If there were another way of handling the djaradin, I would ask it. But, as it were...

You must do what you must.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet Wrathion and Majordomo Selistra at Scalecracker Keep.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It does my heart well to hear such good news from Dragonheart Outpost during such a terrible time. The refugees will be safe at the Life Pools.

Even the djaradin would not raise arms against the might of Queen Alexstrasza herself.</RewardText>
