  <Title>Scientific Meat-thod</Title>
  <Description>So, I have, uh, more homework... Professor Tyrgon's lessons are super tough! He wants us to find out what proto-whelps, uh, eat! Yeah...

I already know the answer! It's riverbeast meat! 

Can you bring me a piece of riverbeast meat? Some riverbeast meat would be a great "visual aid" for my project.

But it has to be a REALLY good piece, ok? Like... the ones from Pudgy Riverbeasts. One like a momma proto-drake would give their whelp to make them strong because, uh, it will make Mister Tyrgon happy.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa piece of Extra-Delicious Riverbeast Meat.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Oh, wow! That's the most delicious-looking meat I've EVER seen! My project will get the BEST grade. The proto-whelp will definitely want this!

&lt;Iyali's expression is suddenly filled with concern.&gt;

Oh no! 

I mean, uh, everyone will lwant to copy me... for the project!

&lt;Iyali smiles unconvincingly.&gt;</RewardText>
