  <Description>From the air, I scouted one of the artifacts Edress uncovered by the entrance of the ruins. Doubtless there are more inside.

They are warded somehow, though I will need to get closer before I can examine them. The magic here is very old.

The grounds appear deserted, but I wouldn't trust that to last long once we start meddling. Keep an eye out. We will uncover all we can.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search the Obsidian Observatory for clues about the dracthyr's past.</LogDescription>
