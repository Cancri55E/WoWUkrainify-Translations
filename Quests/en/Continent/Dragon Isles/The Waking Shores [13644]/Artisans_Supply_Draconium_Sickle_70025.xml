  <Title>Artisan's Supply: Draconium Sickle</Title>
  <Description>You look like someone with nothing to do. How's about employment?

I have a crafting order to fill for the Artisan's Consortium for a draconium sickle. Now I could easily take care of this, but as an apprentice I think it makes more sense for you to take this one on.

Craft the sickle and bring it to the Ruby Lifeshrine, a draenei named Haephesta will pay you for it.</Description>
