  <Title>Wrathion Awaits</Title>
  <Description>These eggs represent a new generation of dragonkind. They must be protected and fostered. Yet... my heart aches, and I worry for Wrathion. I fear his stubborn determination will lead to folly. 

You have been a trusted friend over the years, $n. Perhaps you can go in my place, and help him. 

Seek him out at the Obsidian Bulwark. And please, watch over him. There are so few of his flight left.</Description>
