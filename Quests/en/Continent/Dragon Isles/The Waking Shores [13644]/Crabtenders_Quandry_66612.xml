  <Title>Crabtender's Quandry</Title>
  <Description>The crabs are in danger!

This particular bunch has been through a rough season. Their previous habitat was ransacked by the Primalists, and then I led them to this area only for gorlocs to invade!

I thought they would be safe here, but the gorlocs only nurture aggression in their crabs, leading them to an early demise!

Please, defeat some of the gorlocs so the crabs can escape!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa gorlocs in Cliffdrip Camp.</LogDescription>
