  <Description>Hope ye are a quick study, $c. 'Cause I got no time for a lesson! 

Grab a pack and find a path tae the top o' that peak.

Once yer up there, toss this parachute to our pal Yips. Poor kid got stuck on some vines when these air elementals crashed our plane!

Quickly now, so we can get outta here!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Grab the Climbing Gear, find a handhold, and climb up the cliff to rescue Pathfinder Yips!</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Nice climbing! Yips owes ye a drink or two!

Oh, the elementals? Nah, don't worry 'bout 'em. This is OUR adventure!

&lt;Rocky resumes gleefully shooting bullets through the air elementals.&gt;</RewardText>
