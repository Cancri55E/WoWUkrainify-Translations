  <Title>Disastrous Detour</Title>
  <Description>I knew joining the Dragonscale Expedition meant venturing into dangerous territory. But I was not expecting to fight off elementals!

Our dig site at the Life Vault Ruins is in complete disarray! Stone monstrosities are rising up out of the ground! We called in an elementalist to consult, but I believe she will need all the help she can get.

Perhaps you can help her? Our camp is just across the river.</Description>
