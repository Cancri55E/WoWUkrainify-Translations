  <Title>Adventuring in the Dragon Isles</Title>
  <Description>Oh, I know what you can do!

The Dragonscale Expedition has posted a very fine looking map of the Dragon Isles nearby. 

Their drawings are quite accurate and detailed, if I do say so myself. Sorry, you're not here for an art review.

You should go check it out to see what areas of the Dragon Isles could use your help!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Review the Scouting Map to choose an area within the Dragon Isles to support.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Your decision has been made. You can return to the scouting map at any time to choose another location.&gt;</RewardText>
