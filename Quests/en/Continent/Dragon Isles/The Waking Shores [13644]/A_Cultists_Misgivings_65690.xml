  <Title>A Cultist's Misgivings</Title>
  <Description>Another outsider arrived yesterday. She called herself an "emissary" for the red dragonflight and asked for an audience with our leader, the Voice of Neltharion. 

But the Voice got terribly mad. He said that the Earth-Warder was testing us, and that we had to execute her!

I know we're not supposed to trust outsiders, but we don't have to kill them! Please, help me save her.</Description>
