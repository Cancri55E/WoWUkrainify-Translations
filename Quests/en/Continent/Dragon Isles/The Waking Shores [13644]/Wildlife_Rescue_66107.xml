  <Title>Wildlife Rescue</Title>
  <Description>It doesn't take an ecologist to see that the wetlands are in real trouble.

But Iskha's got us stuck here examining dead creatures when we ought to be stopping them from dying in the first place! The red dragonflight is about preserving life--not dissecting it!

I love Iskha, and he's good at what he does, but if we wait until he's done puttering, there won't be any wetlands left to save. 

I'll manage his overthinking. You get out there, get your boots muddy, and rescue some wildlife.</Description>
