  <Description>Could I have a moment of your time? 

I'm worried about another dracthyr that passed through here. He asked my associates and me all kinds of questions, but seemed... disappointed with our answers.

He called himself "Talon Ethrethi". I believe that makes him quite junior amongst your ranks?

I got the sense that he could use a hand. Mind helping me keep the peace?

I saw him talking with Kholmar over there.</Description>
