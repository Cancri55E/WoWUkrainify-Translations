  <Title>A Charge of Care</Title>
  <Description>You have my thanks, $c, and my condolences for having to deal with those two for as long as you did.

The red dragonflight is charged with the preservation and nurturing of all dragons, even those we may tire of at times.

With the return of the Black Dragonflight's eggs, dragonkind is united as it has not been in thousands of years. I believe this is what will restore our ruby oathstone.

Speak with me when you are ready to bring the eggs to the Obsidian Lifepool.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Witness the Black Dragon Eggs rejoin the Life Pools.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The Life Pools are filled once more, in no small part thanks to you.

With our purpose fulfilled, our oathstone shines once more as a symbol of our calling.</RewardText>
