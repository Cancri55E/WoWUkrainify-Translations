  <Description>Oh, finally! Another dracthyr to lend a hand.

My brother and I have been trying to cook up some rations to eat, but...

&lt;Scaralesh gestures to his surroundings.&gt;

Everything is so different around here. It's hard to find the same ingredients we used to cook with.

But we can adapt. Go ask the Horde if they have anything we can substitute for vegetable matter, protein, and emulsifying fluid. Then we'll really have a meal.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ask around members of the Horde at Dragonscale Basecamp to see if they can loan you the ingredients you need.</LogDescription>
