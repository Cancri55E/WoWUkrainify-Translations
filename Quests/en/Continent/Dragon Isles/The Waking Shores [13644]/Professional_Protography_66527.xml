  <Title>Professional Protography</Title>
  <Description>I haven't trained a photographer as good as you... that's still alive, that is. It's a dangerous profession.

Speaking of dangerous, our final target is a large proto-dragon we believe may be one of the next apex predators in this preserve. Let's get up close and personal and take a picture!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Vertical Enhancement Apparatus and photograph the Slumbering Proto-Dragon.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So totally unrelated, but you didn't see another camera up there, did you?

You know what? Forget I said anything.</RewardText>
