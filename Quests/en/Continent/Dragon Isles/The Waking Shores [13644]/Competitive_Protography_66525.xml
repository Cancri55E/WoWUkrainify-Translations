  <Title>Competitive Protography</Title>
  <Description>Well, now that you've cut your teeth on some starter shots, how about we move onto something a little spicier?

I spotted a gorgeous proto-drake flying around the area behind us. Beautiful horns, scales crackling with electricity... Probably the work of the Primalists, no doubt, but art is art!

See if you can get a picture of the proto-drake and some of its eggs. You might have to climb up a bit to get a good shot!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Photograph an Infused Proto-Dragon Egg and an Infused Proto-Drake.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Oh, look at that! The colors came through beautifully. Looks like you're a pretty good cataloger already!</RewardText>
