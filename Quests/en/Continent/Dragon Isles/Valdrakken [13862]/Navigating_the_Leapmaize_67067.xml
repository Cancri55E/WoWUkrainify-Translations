  <Title>Navigating the Leapmaize</Title>
  <Description>There's a dragon chef in Valdrakken? Truly? I'll have to ask her to try my arclight bisque! It's an old family recipe.

I know the plant you speak of. It grows around streams here, but it's caused some problems.

The stalks of leapmaize seem to be a natural feeding ground for beetles and small salamanthars, which are, in turn, natural prey of the hornswogs. That's fine if you can spot them out in the open, but there's a few here that are incredibly stealthy.

I'd watch my back if I were you.</Description>
