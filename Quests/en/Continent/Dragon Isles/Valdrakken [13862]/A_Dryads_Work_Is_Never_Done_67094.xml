  <Title>A Dryad's Work Is Never Done</Title>
  <Description>It is wonderful to see Valdrakken so lively again, but there are so many things that have wilted under thousands of years of neglect - not the least of which are all of the adorable little city critters! Alas, we don't have enough dryads to go around tending to them all. 

Say, how would you like to be appointed Honorary Valdrakken Dryad? Some of the city's cutest little friends have gone far too long without their preferred snacks. Won't you help me tend to them?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Thalendra feed the many small animals of Valdrakken.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Oh, how wonderful! I bet they all have smiles on their cute little faces, beaks, snouts and whatnot. 

There is one more critter that needs our help, though, and I fear the situation is rather dire.</RewardText>
