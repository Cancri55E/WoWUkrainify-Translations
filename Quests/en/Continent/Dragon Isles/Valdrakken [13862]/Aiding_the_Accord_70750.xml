  <Title>Aiding the Accord</Title>
  <Description>You there! Yes, I'm speaking to you. Who else do you see around here?

&lt;Therazal glances quickly at quite a few passers by.&gt;

Ignore them. They are not part of this request. It is you I've heard of, and you I wish to speak with!

The Valdrakken Accord has asked me to seek out those who have shown they are making a name for themselves across the Isles, and those who seek to ensure our allies and their safety remain the highest priority.

Do what you do best, friend. You shall be rewarded handsomely.</Description>

  <RewardText>Yes, indeed I am impressed, friend. As a representative of the Accord I can assure you your work has not gone unnoticed!

Please, accept this on behalf of our allies.</RewardText>
