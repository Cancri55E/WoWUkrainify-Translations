  <Title>Reviving the Machine</Title>
  <Description>Like all Titanic artifice, Tyrhold contains many wonders. Long ago, Keeper Tyr left behind a machine called the Revival Catalyst for the Aspects so that they could empower their forces should the need for battle arise. It holds great power.

As an ally of dragonkind, they offer the use of this machine to help you brave the trials that are to come. But first, you must seek it out. The catalyst is a great boon, and will provide a keen advantage against your foes should you make use of it.</Description>
