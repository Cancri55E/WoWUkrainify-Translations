ADVENTURE SEEKERS, ARCHIVAL ENTHUSIASTS--

The archives call to those who seek answers, yearn to discover, and those who wish to reveal secrets of the past, and perhaps, the future!

This request is not for the faint of heart, nor those of wavering will.

Only curious and brave adventurers need apply.

  <LogDescription>Speak with Kemora at the archives in Valdrakken.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Kemora turns gracefully to address you. Before speaking, with a smile upon her face, her eyes follow your being from the ground upon which you walk moving upward, slowly, until your eyes meet in a calming gaze.&gt;

Is it answers you seek as well, $r?

I am ready to speak if you are up for the challenge.</RewardText>
