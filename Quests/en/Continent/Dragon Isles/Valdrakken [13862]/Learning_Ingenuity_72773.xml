  <Description>There are some goblins within Valdrakken that are investigating an abandoned titan device. 

Honestly, they're causing quite a disturbance. Some are concerned their investigation could cause more harm than good.

The denizens of Valdrakken would appreciate you meeting these goblins to see if you can find a solution to their investigation.

Without destroying part of our city.</Description>
