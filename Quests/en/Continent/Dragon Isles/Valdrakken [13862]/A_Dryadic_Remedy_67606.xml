  <Title>A Dryadic Remedy</Title>
  <Description>While you were gone, I heard from a dreamhare that one of the local ducklings is feeling rather down in the dumps. Luckily, I know exactly how to fix that!

Whenever I'm feeling moody, I snack on something sweet and tasty! As an expert in cute, lovable creatures, I know that the same principle will surely apply here.

This particular duckling is fond of a local dessert known as a Tasty Hatchling's Treat. Won't you find one and bring it to the poor dear? It's the dryadic thing to do, after all!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Acquire a Tasty Hatchling's Treat and administer it to the Despondent Duckling.</LogDescription>
