  <Description>We need more troops to defend the Obsidian Citadel. Now that we've got a foothold, it's important to make sure we've got fresh eyes and bodies for the effort.

We have additional reserve troops at the Obsidian Bulwark that could reinforce us.

They are well trained, but they'd benefit from a combat test with someone as skilled and experienced as you. So we know they're ready.</Description>
