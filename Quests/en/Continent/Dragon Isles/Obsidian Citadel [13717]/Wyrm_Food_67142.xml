  <Description>It's hungry work, defending and fighting for the Obsidian Citadel, and dragons can eat a great deal. We need to replenish our stores.

Lurking beneath the hardened lava, squirming through the magma, are some very tasty worms. This may not appeal to you, but to a hungry dragon, they are delicious.

Take our servant Gulchak and use his pointer to direct him towards disturbances in the lava. He will attract the worms for you to harvest.</Description>
