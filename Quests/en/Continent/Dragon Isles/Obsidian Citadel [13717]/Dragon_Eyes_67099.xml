  <Title>Dragon Eyes</Title>
  <Description>We know the djaradin will attack us directly, but I'm worried about other dangers out there as well. Ones that aren't so obvious.

I have dispatched three dragons to survey the surrounding area and pinpoint any potential threats.

Meet with each of them. Collect their reports for me. Once you have gathered this information, return to me so we can best prepare for what the djaradin are planning.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Myridian, Zepharion, and Evorian in the nearby areas.</LogDescription>
