  <Title>Disarming Behavior</Title>
  <Description>I have little love for the Worldbeaker dragonkin. They follow a misplaced belief that Deathwing himself will return one day, and they will not help us with the Obsidian Throne.

Weaponmaster Vordak, who once swore loyalty to the Black Prince, has stolen many weapons crafted here in the Citadel and given them to the Worldbreakers. I will not allow such theft. Or such betrayal.

Go to Smoldering Peak and recover the weapons... by force if necessary.</Description>
