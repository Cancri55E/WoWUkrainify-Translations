  <Description>Poor girl...

She must have gotten sick after eating something tainted.

Luckily, my grandfather was a druid and taught me how to treat arcane-based illnesses.

I don't have all the components on me, but we can make do with what's around.

First, I will need some drakmoss. It is a rare lichen that only grows on dragon bones.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Drakmoss Clumps.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Oh! Thank you so much, $n!

I may be a mage, but sometimes natural solutions are the most effective.</RewardText>
