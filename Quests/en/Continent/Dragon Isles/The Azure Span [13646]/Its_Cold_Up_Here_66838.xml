  <Title>It's Cold Up Here</Title>
  <Description>Being a good innkeeper means anticipating guests' needs. Unfortunately, I didn't anticipate how cold the nights would be here. Oops?

My guests are going to need blankets--and good, thick ones. Maybe bear pelts will do?

There are some large bears in the forest just east of here. If you bring me some of their pelts, I'll pay you for them! 

Please? Think of the adventurers and their cold, cold feet...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect thick bear pelts from thickmane bears.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Oh! These are awesome. So luxurious and soft...

Now, only if Valdo were here to clean them up!</RewardText>
