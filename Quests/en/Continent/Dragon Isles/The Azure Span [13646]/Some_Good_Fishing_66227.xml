  <Title>Some Good Fishing</Title>
  <Description>Another pair of hands! I could use some help catching enough fish to bring home for a meal.

These Kirin Tor seem concerned about something called magical anomalies in the area, whatever that means.

You're all welcome to stay here as long as you pitch in and help out.

Grab a fishing pole and start fishing. Many hands make light work!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Catch $3oa blue-tailed minnows within Khuri's Fishing Spot.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ah, that will do nicely! Thank you, adventurer.</RewardText>
