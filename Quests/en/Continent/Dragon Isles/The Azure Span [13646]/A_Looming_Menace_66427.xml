  <Title>A Looming Menace</Title>
  <Description>The arcane wounds I suffered cannot be healed in the field. I am afraid that they are too grave for me to fight. 

I must ask your help again, $n.

You have to find Tharohn and stop her from overloading more consoles. 

Doing so would buy Rannan a few precious moments to calibrate the R.A.D. ... R.A.D.D.E.R... whatever he's calling it now. 

Maybe then we can thwart the Sundered Flame's machinations.</Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>Arcane Manipulator Tharohn</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>A Sundered Flame leader who will stop at nothing to wield the power of the Ruins of Karnthar.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Kill Tharohn.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It is done then.

Now it is all on Rannan. I trust his abilities. They have gotten us this far...</RewardText>
