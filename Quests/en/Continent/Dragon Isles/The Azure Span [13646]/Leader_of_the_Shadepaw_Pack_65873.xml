  <Title>Leader of the Shadepaw Pack</Title>
  <Description>Kargpaw is the true leader of the gnolls in this part of the forest. We've had... unpleasant encounters with him in the past.

This time was different. He carried a strange totem that seemed to twist his very essence.

Kargpaw must be stopped and this totem recovered. I fear the gnolls are meddling in something darker than we can imagine.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>Kargpaw has always been malicious, but he's become more aggressive now that he carries a foul totem.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Kill Kargpaw and recover his totem.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Brena recoils in disgust as she accepts the totem.&gt;

Kargpaw was always violent, but he was also a coward. He and his band never attacked us if we traveled in large numbers.

Something has changed... and this totem is behind it.</RewardText>
