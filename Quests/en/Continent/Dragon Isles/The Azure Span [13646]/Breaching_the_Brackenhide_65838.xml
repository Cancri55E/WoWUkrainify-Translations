  <Title>Breaching the Brackenhide</Title>
  <Description>If the gnolls here have discovered decay magic, the ley line and even the land itself are in grave danger. 

My mirror images are spread too thin to withstand elemental disruption of this scale. Please enter the forest and investigate the decay. 

I'll work with our new tuskarr friends to find a place I can maintain my image. Then, I will meet you deeper in the forest.

We must put a stop to this!</Description>
