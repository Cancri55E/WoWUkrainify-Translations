  <Title>Rowie</Title>
  <Description>You were the one that came back with the others from Brackenhide, weren't you? Then you probably know what happened to Kaqiata...

Her son, Rowie, has been distraught ever since Brena and the others returned without her. I'll stay here in case he comes back, but could you look for him? 

I think he ran off towards the ice cave to the east. He said something about trying to fight the yeti in there!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Rowie.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thanks for helping me. You're nice.</RewardText>
