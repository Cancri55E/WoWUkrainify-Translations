  <Title>Curiosity is Key</Title>
  <Description>My hesitation to discuss these symbols was not for a lack of trust in you, but rather the unknown nature of these symbols and the stones upon which they reside.

Yes, stones. Multiple, in fact. Scattered across the Isles.

&lt;Warpcaster Delandra glances at you. A hint of curiosity and excitement glows in her eyes.&gt;

You did not know.

Very well. Your persistence and willingness to seek me out shows that you are keen to understand your recent discovery. Perhaps it is time we discuss this at length.</Description>
