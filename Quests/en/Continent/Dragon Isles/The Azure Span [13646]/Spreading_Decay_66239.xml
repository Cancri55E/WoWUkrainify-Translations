  <Title>Spreading Decay</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Brena turns Kargpaw's totem over and over in her thick hands.&gt;

Kargpaw is a pawn. He isn't the source of this rot. We must find it, before the decay spreads further.

The closest tuskarr presence from here is a trading outpost, just across the bridge on the way to Iskaara.

We should check in with them... and quickly.</Description>
