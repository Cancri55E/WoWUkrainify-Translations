  <Title>To the Mountain</Title>
  <Description>It's a sight to behold up there, Khadgar and Kalecgos fighting the Primalists in the sky!

They've summoned several mirror images of themselves to help you through the monstrous hole the Primalists have created.

One pair is at the base of the mountains right now. 

If things start to look bad... well I'll get the word out to the rest of us in the Azure Span.</Description>
