  <Title>Nothing for Breakfast</Title>
  <Description>My brother Valdo was supposed to order more supplies. But it's been a week and nothing has come. 

I'm not surprised. The lazy oaf probably took a nap instead! Now we're short on food, and I'm too busy to hunt on top of my chores--and Valdo's! 

Would you hunt for us? The meat of the vorquin striders and striped bruffalon south of here would keep the kitchen open until I can order supplies.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect meat from the vorquin striders and striped bruffalon south of Three-Falls Lookout.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thanks to you--and no thanks to Valdo--I can feed all these hungry travelers!

Hmm... are you looking for a job? I've got a recent "opening"...

Can't pay you much, but you can have Valdo's spot! No? Ah well, can't blame me for trying.</RewardText>
