  <Title>Arcane Detection</Title>
  <Description>Greetings! I am Miva Star-Eye, and I am conducting arcane investigations in this area. 

The Azure Span has magic all around it. Some of it is benign... while some can be quite dangerous. 

I've been tasked with ensuring no arcane energies reside in anything the tuskarr possess. 

We already had one incident in Camp Antonidas of a fishing box spontaneously combusting! 

Can you take my detector and examine a few objects here? I need to continue speaking with Julk over here.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Investigate tuskarr objects in Khuri's Fishing Spot for signs of arcane magic.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>A toy boat that's a magical time bomb?

Oh boy.</RewardText>
