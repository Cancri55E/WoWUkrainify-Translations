  <Title>Legendary Foil</Title>
  <Description>Last night, I was lying in my bedroll, tossing and turning, when an unnatural chill filled the inn. 

Then, out of nowhere I saw... the ghost of a draconid! It went through my luggage then vanished into thin air! 

But the true horror is that when I woke up... the ghost had taken my most beloved card!

Would you be so kind as to track down the ghost and get my card back? It is my most prized possession.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>Whatever the reason, there are always better and smarter decisions than stealing.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Find the draconid ghost and retrieve the legendary card.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The apparition explained itself and asked for forgiveness.

But then they asked to play a single match with me. 

Our game is apparently very different from what they used to play, and they wanted to try it.

Thank you for helping both of us. Maybe the match will be fun?</RewardText>
