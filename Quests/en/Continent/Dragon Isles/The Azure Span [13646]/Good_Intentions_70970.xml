  <Description>I may know where the artifact is. Alia was whispering frantically when you brought all the shards back.

She kept saying something about a "cave" and how the spiders seemed attracted to it.

There's no cave in the area in front of us... which leads me to believe there might be one deeper in the ruins.

We'll stay here and keep your escape path open, $n. Please save Alia and destroy this cursed artifact.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>Let's hope we get there in time before Alia is consumed by the artifact.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Stop Alia Sunsoar and destroy the artifact Valthrux.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>To'tik was right. This place is cursed. 

We'll let the Kirin Tor know what happened here, $n. Thank you for your help. 

This is a lesson I won't soon forget...</RewardText>
