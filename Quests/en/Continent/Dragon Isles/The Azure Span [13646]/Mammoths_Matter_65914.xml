  <Title>Mammoths Matter</Title>

Their souls will linger in rage, after such a massacre. We must honor their lives by making good use of their remains.

There's too many for us to gather alone. Please, gather what materials you can from the youngsters and matriarchs, then meet me in the Kauriq Gleamlet.</Description>
