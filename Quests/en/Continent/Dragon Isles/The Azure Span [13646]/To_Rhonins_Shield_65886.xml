  <Title>To Rhonin's Shield</Title>
  <Description>Raszageth and the Primalists are launching an all out assault on Vakthros. We cannot let her succeed!

Khadgar and I will go ahead to handle the situation there from the sky.

In the meantime, make your way to the Rhonin's Shield, one of the last Kirin Tor camps in the area.

You may be able to get there faster by riding that drake of yours from the top of the archives.

See that the Kirin Tor there are all right, then make your way to Vakthros.

We'll be counting on your help from the ground.</Description>
