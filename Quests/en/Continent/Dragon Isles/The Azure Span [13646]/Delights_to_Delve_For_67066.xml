  <Description>Rumi and Morsel?

Gosh, that was quite a long time ago now. Eating a fish with a dragon and duck chef duo sounds like the beginning of a tale Elder Poa might tell for the younglings. We'd be hard-pressed to forget such a happening!

The fish was a Savory Deviant Dealfish, a top Tuskarr favorite! They're rare, but found just off the coast here.

Fair warning - it's azuretooth mating season. Those bloodthirsty fiends will take a chunk out of you for messing with their favorite snack.</Description>
