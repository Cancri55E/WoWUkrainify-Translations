  <Title>Water Safety</Title>
  <Description>My greatest responsibility is to make sure everyone has access to clean drinking water.

With the gnolls to the east dealing with the decay, I must make sure that the camp is safe.

I don't want to alarm anyone by personally taking samples, but I feel testing is necessary.

Bring me samples from the three nearby waterfalls, and I will reward you handsomely.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring three water samples to Manny Read.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>A deep wyrm?

Something must have driven it away from its underground nest. Whatever spooked this apex predator  must be very terrible indeed.

Thank you, $p, I will make sure to remove the carcass it doesn't contaminate the water.</RewardText>
