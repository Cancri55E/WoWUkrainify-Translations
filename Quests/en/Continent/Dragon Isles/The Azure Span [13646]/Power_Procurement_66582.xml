  <Description>In normal circumstances, the capture of energy is not problematic. However, the energy we require is massive and unstable. This enchanted vessel should provide a safe means of transport.

There is a region to the southwest filled with energy-laden creatures. The anomalous energy within these creatures is powerful, but unstable.

Capture their energy and return it to me. Then we may embark on the remainder of this journey together.</Description>
