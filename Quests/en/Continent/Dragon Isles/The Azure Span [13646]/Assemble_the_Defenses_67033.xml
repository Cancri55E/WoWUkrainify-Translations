  <Title>Assemble the Defenses</Title>
  <Description>The Primalists have been hunting the Kirin Tor since we arrived in the Azure Span. They detest our practice of arcane magic.

I'll send word to Kalecgos to return from the Azure Archives. In the meantime, we need to hold them off.

It seems one of our main arcane defenses was destroyed in their initial attack. Bring the pieces back to me and I can reassemble it.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover $1oa pieces of the Arcane Blaster.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Excellent. I'll begin the ritual to fix this in a moment.</RewardText>
