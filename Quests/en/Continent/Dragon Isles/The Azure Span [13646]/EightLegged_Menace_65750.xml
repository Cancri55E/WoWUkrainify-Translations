  <Title>Eight-Legged Menace</Title>
  <Description>$C!

I require your aid if you're willing...

This joint expedition was intended to study the unique arachnids inhabiting the area, but, as you can see, our plan has gone awry. 

What we originally assumed was an evolutionary adaptation is instead a Primalist perversion of the natural order!

I take my responsibilities as a conservationist seriously, but the time for studying live specimens has passed. We can't let their perversion spread. We can study their corpses instead. 

Will you help us?</Description>

  <RewardText>An unfortunate necessity. We could not allow them to spread.

I think we've learned all we can from them.</RewardText>
