  <Title>Echoes of the Fallen</Title>
  <Description>There are tuskarr here! My friends, my people--my family. They left for a hunt not a week ago.

Already they're too decayed to recover. 

Their spirits are here still. They linger in rage and regret. Kaqiata, Lutokk, Tuyuki...

Please, $n, take this totem and place it near their remains. It'll contact their spirits... and help them find peace.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Place Brena's Totem near $1oa tuskarr corpses to contact their spirits.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So they all chose to lend their power to my totem? 

&lt;Brena squeezes her eyes shut in sorrow.&gt; 

Thank you, my friends. We will use the strength of your spirits well. The gnolls will not reach Iskaara.</RewardText>
