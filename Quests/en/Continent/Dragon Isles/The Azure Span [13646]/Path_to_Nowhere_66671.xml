  <Description>Ye look like a willin' and able adventurer! How would ye like to help out the Dragonscale Expedition?

We've got ourselves a lovely camp in the middle of a nice bit of wilderness.

There's plenty for ye to do if ye'd like to take the trip over there. 

Talk to me sis, Maddy, when ye get there. She'll get ye all settled in.</Description>

  <RewardText>Caddy sent ye? She wasn't here before all the commotion broke out with the tuskarr and the furbolg!

To say we got things to do in the camp is a wee understatement. We're flooded with problems!</RewardText>
