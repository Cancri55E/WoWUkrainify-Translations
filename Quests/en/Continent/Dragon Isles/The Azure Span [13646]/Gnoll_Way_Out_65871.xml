  <Title>Gnoll Way Out</Title>
  <Description>I've tracked the captured tuskarr, including my husband Norukk, to this cave. 

Norukk doesn't always look out for his own hide, so that responsibility falls to me. But I'm not too proud to ask for help.

Please rescue them!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rescue Norukk and $1oa other captive tuskarr.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Hanu wrinkles her cheeks and shoots a tusky grin at Norukk.&gt;

I'm beyond relieved that Norukk made it out alive. We will mourn those we lost once we return to Iskaara.</RewardText>
