  <Title>To the Ruins!</Title>
  <Description>Are you interested in hearing about my invention, the R.A.D.? No?

Well, I'll tell you anyway--because it found something.

Today it detected a HUGE SURGE of arcane energy from the Karnthar Ruins. Lathos thinks the Sundered Flame are to blame. It's the PERFECT opportunity to showcase the R.A.D.!

Wanna come? It's going to be awesome.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet Rannan and Lathos in the Ruins of Karnthar.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You missed it! We walked RIGHT into a Sundered Flame patrol. 

Lathos SLASHED through them, but there were too many!

So, I started casting arcane explosions left and right... KAPOW! ZING!

Oh, but um, yes... the energy surge...</RewardText>
