  <Title>Toejam the Terrible</Title>
  <Description>You're right, I'm not strong enough to take on this yeti... not alone! 

But you're here!

The lair of the evil yeti, Toejam the Terrible, is just ahead. This cave is... big. Not scary! Maybe a little scary. 

Could you go in there and soften him up a bit? I'll... I'll be right behind you!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Rowie slay Toejam the Terrible.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Goodness, what did you tell him? I've never seen Rowie so spirited!

Thank you for bringing him home. I will do my best to take care of him in Kaqiata's place.</RewardText>
