  <Title>The Ailing Apprentice</Title>
  <Description>This mission was a mistake from the beginning. Alia Sunsoar enlisted our aid to keep the Sundered Flame from acquiring a dangerous artifact. We had tracked it down to these ruins.

But the Sundered Flame beat us here and the area is infested with ice spiders. Alia was badly poisoned, and I fear she will not last long without the antidote.

I can make it, but I need venom glands from the nearby spiders. I'm afraid to leave her. Will you find some for me?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Frozen Venom Glands.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ah, wonderful! With these venom glands, I can brew an antidote for Alia. She'll be feeling better in no time at all.</RewardText>
