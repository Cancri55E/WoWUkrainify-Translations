  <Description>&lt;Ranpiata's eyes look damp.&gt;

Is it me? Am I the reason he has lost his spark?

He says he loves me, but... you heard how not painting makes him feel.

I want what is best for him. If he is better off... I will go. 

There is one last piece he threw away. The last thing he tried to draw before giving up. 

I could not bear to see it go. I hid it away in our home. Please... bring it to him... as a memento.</Description>
