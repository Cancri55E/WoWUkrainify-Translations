  <Title>His Stone Heart</Title>
  <Description>We howl with grief for our chieftain, yet he lives.

What remains of Stoneheart is in the cave ahead. Many tried to reason with him. 

He killed them--and almost killed Narn.

He is a monster! This is the goal of the primalists. They would turn us into stone and flame to serve them.

There is no Rustpine left in him. He must be destroyed before others meet the same fate.</Description>
