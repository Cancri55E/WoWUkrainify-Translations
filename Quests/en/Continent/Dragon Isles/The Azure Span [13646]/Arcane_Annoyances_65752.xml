  <Title>Arcane Annoyances</Title>
  <Description>A large number of mana wyrms are absorbing the wild arcane magic coming out from the archives.

The rate that they're doing it is causing the ley lines to be thrown off balance... which is preventing the Azure Oathstone from being reclaimed.

I will use some of the unstable arcana you collected to form a hook of sorts.

Use it to slay several of the wyrms. The brief delay will be enough for me to adjust the energies below.</Description>
