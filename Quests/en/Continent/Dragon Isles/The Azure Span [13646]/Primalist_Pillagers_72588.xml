  <Title>Primalist Pillagers</Title>
  <Description>I'm startin' tae grasp the basics of Winterpelt, but what I'm pickin' up is grim.

Seems a band of Winterpelt foragers fell afoul o' the nearby Primalists. The winters here are as harsh as any in Dun Morogh, an' the supplies they were gatherin' will be sorely missed.

Why don't ya see about recoverin' what ye can. With prejudice, if ye don't mind.</Description>
