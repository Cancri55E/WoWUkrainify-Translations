  <Title>Fishy Fingers</Title>
  <Description>Now that Mordigan's off licking rocks, we can get to the crux of the problem...

Those perfidious fishmen have pilfered my parts!

We weren't in this dinky little village for more than an hour and WHAM! Gorloc were swarming all over us! Rowe was yelling, Aelnara was screaming, and I'm flailing around with my wrench like a madgnome! 

See if you can't salvage the situation and get some of my parts back!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover $1oa Stolen Parts in Gorloc Shore.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You're back! I'll start getting the Geoscanner 289-07 reconfigured and as functional as circumstances allow. These seaside conditions are admittedly less than ideal.</RewardText>
