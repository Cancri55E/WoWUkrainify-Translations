  <Title>The Heart of the Deck</Title>
  <Description>The day the Dragon Isles began their slumber was the day of my very last match. Fate was cruel, and I lost my strongest card before I could compete.

Guo-Hee's card, you see, was mine. I do not know how her ancestors came upon it.

Alas, I cannot claim it as my own as it has been in her family for centuries. That was a foolish mistake on my part.

Perhaps you and I could craft a card together? A truly unique card... Yes! Will you help me?

Speak to me once you are ready.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help the apparition craft a new card.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This is it! I have never seen such a card before! Such power! So many possibilities!

Magnificent!

Thank you, $n. Now I am ready...</RewardText>
