  <Title>The Weave of a Tale</Title>
  <Description>My dearest wife, Poa, is an excellent storyteller. 

But it's been thirty years, and she tells the same ones over and over again! Please, $c, talk to Poa and give her a new story to tell.

What's that? Tell her a story about your adventures? Don't be ridiculous -- I don't want to hear about that! The greatest stories are always about fish. Tell a story about fish, even if you have to make one up!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Tell Elder Poa a fishy tale.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank goodness, a new story. 

Let's hear it!</RewardText>
