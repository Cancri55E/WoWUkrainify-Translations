  <Title>Elemental Unfocus</Title>
  <Description>Kalecgos and I are under heavy fire in the skies above the mountain. The Primalists are unrelenting and their army endless.

Soon, Kalecgos and I may be overrun by their forces.

But I have a plan.

At the base of the mountain is a disturbed orc named Ruvin Stonegrinder. The Kirin Tor fought her numerous times.

She holds a device that can absorb and redirect elemental energies. 

Take it from her, then meet me further in.</Description>
