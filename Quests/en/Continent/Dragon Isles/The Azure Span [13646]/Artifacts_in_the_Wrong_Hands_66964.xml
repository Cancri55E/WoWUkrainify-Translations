  <Title>Artifacts in the Wrong Hands</Title>
  <Description>We've got a myriad, no, an incalculable number of problems here!

Oh man, where to start! 

The Kirin Tor uncovered a Sundered Flame plot. They're after an artifact called "Valthrux".

It's immensely powerful and... sentient? That's an exponential increase in danger if you're keeping track.

One Alia Sunsoar went south with a pair of tuskarr to investigate the Sundered Flame. She should have been back by now.

Please find her and stop the Sundered Flame from acquiring the artifact!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate Alia Sunsoar in the Lost Ruins within Azure Span.</LogDescription>
