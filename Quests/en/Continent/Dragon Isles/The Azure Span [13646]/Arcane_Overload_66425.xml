  <Title>Arcane Overload</Title>
  <Description>There! Finished!

May I present to you... the R.A.D.D.E.R!

DUN DUN DUUUUN! 

I have calibrated it to the frequency of the energy surrounding the dragon consoles and inscribed a glyph of dispel magic on it.

The R.A.D.D.E.R. will dispel the arcane energy and shut down the dragon console, but the glyph will weaken after each use.

Pretty handy, isn't it?

I detect four of these consoles in our vicinity. Go shut them down!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Rannan dispel the arcane bubbles.</LogDescription>

Well, you and the R.A.D.D.E.R...

But whatever... Now, help me get Lathos back to Camp Nowhere.</RewardText>
