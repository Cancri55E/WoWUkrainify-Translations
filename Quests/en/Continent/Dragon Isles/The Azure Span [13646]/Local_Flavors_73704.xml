  <Title>Local Flavors</Title>
  <Description>Now that we have the base o' the brew figured out, we need tae add the spice.

Put that rudimentary Winterpelt I taught ye tae use and ask around for local ingredients tae blend into the flavor profile. Try talkin' with Kazzi. From what I gather she's somethin' of a trader. 

The finished brew will be a mix of dwarven and Winterpelt traditions which seems appropriate for the circumstances.

An' if we're lucky, it won't taste half bad!</Description>
