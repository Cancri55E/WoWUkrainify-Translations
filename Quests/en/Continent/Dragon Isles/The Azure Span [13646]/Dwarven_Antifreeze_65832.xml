  <Title>Dwarven Antifreeze</Title>
  <Description>I'm in a wee bit of a pickle, $Uladdie:lassie;. The Primalist frost lickers stuck me in this overgrown ice cube and the only reason I'm nae frozen solid yet is me secret stash o' the good stuff. 

Sadly, me less secret stashes got nicked when tae thieving scum jumped me. I'm runnin' low!

Would ye do a dwarf a kindness and fetch me flasks afore me blood turns tae ice?

Oh, and $Uladdie:lassie;, if ye do haftae pull one out o' some spider's unmentionables, dinnae tell me. I'd rather nae know.</Description>
