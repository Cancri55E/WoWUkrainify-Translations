  <Title>Tending the Forge</Title>
  <Description>If you're looking for an instructor, I'm sorry to say I... Ah, you're not an apprentice! My apologies. Allow me to introduce myself. 

I am Custodian Vernagos, one of the caretakers of these ruins. More specifically, the task of restoring this workspace to its former glory has fallen upon my very tired shoulders. 

Would you be able to lend a hand? All the reagents I need are nearby: ice elemental cores, embercones, hornswog leather...

Fairly standard, easily gathered stuff. What say you?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather reagents for the forge by collecting hornswog hides, dormant embercones, and calving cores around Camp Antonidas.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Custodian Vernagos in Camp Antonidas.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $p. The embercones will burn hot. The elemental cores will temper the heat. And this leather... is fairly disgusting. But the bellows they produce will more than suffice!

Now all I need is time.</RewardText>
