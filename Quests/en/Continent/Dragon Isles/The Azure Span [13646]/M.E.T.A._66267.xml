  <Description>Those fiends! Pillaging and murder are one thing, but animal abuse? I'll not stand for it. 

The gnolls have set out traps for animals to catch and feed to their slavering hyena mutts. Find a way to free their fluffy captives and show the ruffians how a mage ethically treats animals!

Of course this makes ethical sense in light of my recent actions. What exactly are you trying to insinuate?</Description>
