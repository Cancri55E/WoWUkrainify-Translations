  <Description>Bah! Work together, she says? 

But... if the Gleamfisher believes there is a chance we can help the other tribes... we must try. 

For the wind spirit Kraunot to acknowledge us, we will first have to tend to his element. The nearby wind elementals have been agitated ever since the land began to awaken.

While I inspect this boat you two made, you go and fight to dismantle them, then bring me their restless motes. That should bring some calm back to the area.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Restless Wind Motes from Restless Winds near the Kauriq Gleamlet.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I will tend to these motes, so they dissipate harmlessly. Kraunot will be pleased.</RewardText>
