  <Title>Warm Away These Shivers</Title>
  <Description>I believe the plant you're looking has a fine, narrow stem and red leaves all about it.

You'll be hard-pressed not to run into any of those dastardly crawlers while you're collecting flowers though. I'd advise you steer clear when you can, or ready a sharp weapon when you can't.

And let your dragon friend know they can repay me in a cup or two of the stuff next time I'm in the city.</Description>

  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Rumiastrasza at The Ruby Feast in Valdrakken.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Ah! This is most certainly the Coldsnap Sagittate! My nostrils are exhilarated! 

Excellent work, $n! I am positive our venerable guests will be gargling your praises with each sip of warmth imbibed. Let us not forget to do so with some of these delicious little cakes Morsel and Flemthroat made as well!</RewardText>
