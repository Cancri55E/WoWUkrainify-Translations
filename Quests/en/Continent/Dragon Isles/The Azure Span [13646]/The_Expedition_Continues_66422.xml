  <Title>The Expedition Continues!</Title>
  <Description>An ancient site, an organization with inscrutable motivations--even Rannan's R.A.D and its analyses...

We must discover more about what's going on here.

There are stairs to the south leading up to a tower. We shall press on.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet Rannan and Lathos by the tower.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>These Sundered Flame did not die by my hand... or by Rannan's "signature move." 

They were dead when we arrived. 

Rannan believes they suffered multiple traumatic wounds caused by arcane energy.

I agree with his observations. But it's unclear if it was the dragon console discharging or friendly fire...</RewardText>
