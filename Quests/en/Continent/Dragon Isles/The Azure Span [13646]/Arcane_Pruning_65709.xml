  <Title>Arcane Pruning</Title>
  <Description>We cannot activate the oathstone in the Azure Archives until we fix the issue with the out of control ley energy here.

Two out of the three draconic runes that are meant to control it are being choked by unstable arcana.

I apologize that this falls to you, given Khadgar's responsibilities and the lack of my brethren appearing.

There should be a ley scepter within that bag of helpful goods you have.

Use it to help repair the runes nearby.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Look through the Bag of Helpful Goods for the Ley Scepter, then use it to repair 2 platforms.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Excellent work. It seems these runes are able to transport us to the top of the archives.

I believe that may be where our last problem resides...</RewardText>
