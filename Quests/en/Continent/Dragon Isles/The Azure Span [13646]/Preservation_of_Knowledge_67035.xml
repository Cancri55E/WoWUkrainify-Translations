  <Title>Preservation of Knowledge</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, $r. I am Althanus. I wish we could have met in a less... chaotic time.

We were helping the Kirin Tor study the history of this place just a few moments before the Primalists attacked.

I fear several tomes may still be out there, at risk of being destroyed in this dreadful assault.

Please, you must recover these tomes! If they're destroyed, the history of this place will be lost.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find $1oa Ancient Tomes scattered around Camp Antonidas.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>What a relief! To lose all that knowledge... I could not bear the thought.</RewardText>
