  <Title>Afront 'Till A Salt</Title>
  <Description>We don't mind accommodating you and your friends in our little place--not that anyone asked-- but would you be a good neighbor and nab me some crystal flakes if you're going up to the springs? We use 'em to preserve all kinds of things. It's a crucial part of keeping food around here.

The larger gorlocs are absolutely covered in the stuff. Maybe get some flakes off them?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Gather $1oa Crystal Flakes in Gorloc Shore.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This is will go a long way in helping us in these parts. We just might let your friends stick around...</RewardText>
