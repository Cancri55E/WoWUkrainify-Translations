  <Title>WANTED: Frigellus</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The page's script glows with a soft blue light.&gt;

Previously a cherished plaything of Malygos, the elemental Frigellus suffered from his master's neglect. 

While this once-happy settlement crumbled apace, the churlish and playful creature grew warped and twisted by the evils that plague this land.

Please see that it is safely neutralized.

Bring word of your success to Custodian Cynegos.</Description>
