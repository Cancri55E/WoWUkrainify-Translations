  <Title>Protect And Herd</Title>
  <Description>I was talking with some hunters out of Iskaara the other day, and they mentioned finding a grisly scene. 

Apparently, a particularly murderous rhino, Bloodhorn, has been goring the smaller bruffalon in the area. 

The bruffalon have enough competition in Azure Span without worrying about getting their herds thinned out by an invasive brute from out of town!

Bring me his horn. I'd like to make a good impression on our Tuskarr friends!</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>A spiteful beast that is decimating the local bruffalon population.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Hunt down Bloodhorn east of Iskaara.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Speak to Hemet Nesingwary Jr. in Camp Nowhere.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Excellent job, $p! This will go a long way in helping the bruffalon prosper and will hopefully show our Tuskarr neighbors we are also good stewards of this land.

We could learn a lesson from Bloodhorn. Just cause we're stomping through this beautiful place doesn't give us the right to do what we want with it!

Always leave the world better than you found it.</RewardText>
