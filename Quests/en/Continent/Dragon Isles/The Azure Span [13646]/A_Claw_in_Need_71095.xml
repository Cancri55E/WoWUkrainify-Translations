  <Description>Let's see what we can do to help this guy!

Don't worry, we aren't gonna let him take anything or stuff like that. Let's just have some fun!

It's been ages since anyone has come up here to check up on us. We're SO bored!

&lt;Heleth winks at you.&gt; 

Why don't you ask him what he wants?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ask Venderthvan how you can help him and do what he says.</LogDescription>
