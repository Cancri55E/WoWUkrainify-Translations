  <Title>Needles to Say</Title>
  <Description>I want to help Sylvie, but I don't want to delay Cally any longer.

To give Sylvie the medicine, I need arcane-infused quills from the crystalpine. I'm sure they won't mind if you pluck a few off! 

And mind the bakar! They eat crystalpine and might get mad at you touching it. If you do have to defend yourself, you can collect some spines from them as well.

But... try not to do that, please.</Description>
