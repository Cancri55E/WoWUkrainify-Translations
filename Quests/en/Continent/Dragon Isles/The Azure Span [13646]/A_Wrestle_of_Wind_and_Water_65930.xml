  <Title>A Wrestle of Wind and Water</Title>
  <Description>Now we should be able to face the Spirits.

Did Ruriq fail to mention it? By our tribe's traditions, we must face the Spirits in combat before asking a boon of them. The strength of their blessing is dependent on how well you impress them. 

Perhaps that is why the Gleamfisher insisted we all work together.

If you take on Kraunot, the Spirit of Air, Ruriq and I will tackle Otu'rorq, the Spirit of Water.

They dwell in the cave behind the nearby waterfall. We will meet you there, adventurer.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Face Kraunot, the Spirit of Air, near the Kauriq Gleamlet.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>With how much older he is, Kauj has always been almost... more a father than a brother. 

I thought getting older and starting my own family would make me feel less like I needed him. 

I was wrong. Even before my wife passed, I was wrong.</RewardText>
