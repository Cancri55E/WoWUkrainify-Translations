  <Description>Alright! The R.A.D.D.E.R.E.R is calibrated and ready to go--for you!

Why am I not using it? Simple! 

You have to think of and consider all the possibilities. 

Let's say it blows up. Who would fix it if I am injured, unconscious, or dead? Could you imagine? 

Now, go dispel the barrier so we can return to camp and get Lathos patched up. I'll be... standing back.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the R.A.D.D.E.R.E.R to dispel the arcane barrier.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Just like that he's... gone?

He gave his life to save us because the R.A.... the machine didn't work.

Lathos believed in me... I should have listened... I let him down...</RewardText>
