  <Title>Prowling Polar Predators</Title>
  <Description>The species we've been sent to study is the frigidpelts.

Their hunting grounds have been tainted by ley lines. Arcane energies leech into the water and into the plants... and into prey species like the slyvern.

My report will help the Kirin Tor decide what to do for them.</Description>
