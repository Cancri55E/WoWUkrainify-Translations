  <Title>Cut Out the Rot</Title>
  <Description>This decay must have rotted these gnolls' brains as well as their bodies! 

Destructive as they are, gnolls are native to this land--just like us.

But we already saw them spreading decay to the Big Tree Tribe. At this rate, they'll consume the Span and destroy themselves. 

We can't let this happen. It's a shame... but put an end to them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa Rotting Treants and $2oa Brackenhide Rotflingers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Gnolls can be fascinating creatures! They're not evil, only wild. And very dumb. 

Killing them is a shame, but the decay helps no one. And we can't let them hurt our family.</RewardText>
