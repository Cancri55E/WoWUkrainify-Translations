  <Title>They Took the Kits</Title>
  <Description>If Sylvie is this distressed, that must mean it's her kits that are in there! 

While she was infected, the giants must have kit-napped her babies and she was too weak to save them.

Kits are energetic at this age, hopefully they've all been quick enough to evade the giants until now...

Here, make use of my invisibility charm-- Quickly, you must save them before they're eaten!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Rescue the kits.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Now that Sylvie is healing, these kits will be in good hands...

Er, paws...

Claws?</RewardText>
