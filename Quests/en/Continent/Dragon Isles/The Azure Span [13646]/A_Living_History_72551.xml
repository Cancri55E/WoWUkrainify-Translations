  <Description>The Winterpelt finally trust us enough to ask for aid.

We must nurture this trust so we may one day clasp their paws in friendship!

This Winterpelt, Jyrra of the, uh, Fuzzy Feet, says their elders went into hiding during the Primalist attack on their  village. I don't yet understand their language, but it seems the elders left markers to help the clan find them later.

It's time to let the Winterpelt elders know it's safe to come home. Will you convey this message? It seems a simple enough task.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Follow the markers to find the hidden Winterpelt elders.</LogDescription>
