  <Description>Aye, sounds like a right mess up there--like a storm blew through and wrecked the whole place. I can see why they'd be up in arms, but why attack us?

This would be a lot easier if we could just talk it out, but the Winterpelt are famously tight-lipped and don't seem to speak any of the common branches of Furbolg-ish. Furbolgian? Eh, ye know what I mean.

I don't suppose ya happened to have a nice chat with any of 'em while ye were checking in on them, did ye?</Description>
