  <Title>Hive Maintenance</Title>
  <Description>It wouldn't do tae steal a hive's honey without ensurin' they have enough food tae make it through the cold. Especially if we might want more down the line.

Frostbell pollen's sticky stuff an' a wee bit fragile. But if ye run through some of the bloomin' plants, it'll be on ye like fleas on a kobold.

Then, all ye have to do is bring it back tae a bee afore it blows away--they'll lick it right off ye! Tickles a bit too!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring pollen to the Honeyfreeze bees.</LogDescription>
