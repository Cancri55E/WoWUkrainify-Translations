  <Description>Now for this ley line. It looks like my fears were correct -- the decay has spread into the line itself.

We'll need to purge the decay and speed along the healing process, but I can't channel enough energy with my mirror image alone. 

Focus yourself on this ley crystal here. My connection with you will help me teleport here physically. Then, I will be strong enough.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Focus on the Ley Crystal, then destroy 3 Decay Infections.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Find Kalecgos outside Brackenhide.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>We did it. Great work, $n. Breathe the fresh air again!

With this ley line restored, and Khadgar finishing up on the one in the tower, the Oathstone should be ready to claim. I must return to the Azure Archives shortly.</RewardText>
