  <Title>A Shard of the Past</Title>
  <Description>I've seen ye runnin' in and out of the camp helpin' people. Ye think ye could help ol' Gannar too?

I surveyed the area, and somethin' caught me old eyes. I think 'tis an ancient potsherd or a jar or somethin' just down south of here at the edge of that waterfall.

Now, I am not much of a swimmer, but I'll give ye some coin and you can deliver the findings to Thanessa Silverbloom.</Description>
