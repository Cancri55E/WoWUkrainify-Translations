  <Title>Grungir the Explorer</Title>
  <Description>$N! My Explorers' League counterpart, Grungir Ironspout, wasn't among those you rescued. He had fought his way free originally, but once he saw how few of us made it out, he turned around and headed right back in! Alone!

The oaf is as brave as he is impulsive and does not deserve whatever fate has befallen him.

Please... find him.</Description>
