  <Title>What of the Winterpelt Clan?</Title>
  <Description>We could join another clan... if we knew it to be safe.

I worry the Primalists tempted other clans as they did ours. 

This "Dragonscale Expedition" tells me they have a clawhold near the Winterpelt clan.

They may be tainted. Or they may heed our warning. With either truth, they need us.

There is a "furbolg expert," Sonova Snowden, in Theron's Watch. Please go to him and learn what he knows.</Description>
