  <Title>A Little Kelp for My Friends</Title>
  <Description>Well gosh, it sure sounds like Grimtusk is in a pickle. I'd say I'm done with conflicts on the mainland, but...

Frostbite and I have got a history. And a score to settle.

Oh, fiddle! I can't leave the others here undefended... We've an issue with an elemental causing trouble at the beach. I'm the only one who can keep him at bay. Slippery fella... literally.

Tell you what. If you will deal with the elemental for me, I'll mosey on over to Grimtusk's camp.

Whaddaya say, champ?</Description>
