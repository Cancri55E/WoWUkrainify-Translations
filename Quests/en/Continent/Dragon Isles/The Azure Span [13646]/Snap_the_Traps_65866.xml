  <Title>Snap the Traps</Title>
  <Description>The hills ahead are littered with insidious bladejaw traps.

With a keen eye, you should be able to locate them. Very carefully spring the traps using this old tuskarr trick: a long stick. Note that while stepping on them is another way to set the traps off, I wouldn't recommend it.

Once enough have been removed, find Hanu. Elder Poa and I will catch up when we can.</Description>
