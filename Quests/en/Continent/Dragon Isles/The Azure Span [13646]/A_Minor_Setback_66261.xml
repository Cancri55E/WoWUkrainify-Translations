  <Title>A Minor Setback</Title>
  <Description>Ah, adventurer! Just the sort of well-armed individual I was hoping to encounter.

I'm here in this literal backwater on very important Kirin Tor business, you see, and whilst I was beginning to set up my camp, I was chased off by filthy, mangy gnolls.

In fact, a rather concerning number of gnolls have gathered nearby, enough that I believe they pose a threat to the wider Span.

Fear not though, for I have a plan! Meet me in the lake just over there, and I'll explain everything.</Description>
