  <Description>&lt;You hear muffled muttering coming from the other end of the portal.&gt;

Hey! Hey you! 

I have some mail for our apprentices in the field: care packages, gifts, things they've ordered via magical courier... 

Standard fare, really.

Mind doing me a favor and handing them out?</Description>

  <RewardText>Well done! Don't worry... it's the courier's fault if a parcel wasn't marked "fragile."</RewardText>
