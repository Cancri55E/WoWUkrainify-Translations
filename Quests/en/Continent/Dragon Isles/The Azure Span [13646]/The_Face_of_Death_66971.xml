  <Title>The Face of Death</Title>
  <Description>Tell me, friend. Have you ever seen the face of death?

&lt;Nesingwary pauses for dramatic effect.&gt;

What am I saying? Of course you have.

Death, after all, has many faces. 

I've heard tell from the Imbu tuskarr that one of its faces lives up in these hills. To even say its name is to invite a violent, frigid death:

Frostjaw.

&lt;Nesingwary looks around warily.&gt;

Well, now you have to hunt it--for my sake at least!</Description>
