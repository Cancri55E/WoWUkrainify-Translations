  <Title>Those Aren't for Chewing</Title>
  <Description>I found one of Ponoliak's funerary offerings, mishandled and then discarded by these Shadepaw gnolls... It has bite marks all over it!

This offering, and others like it, are needed for the memorial ceremony for the recently deceased Iskaara chieftain.

It's a travesty that something so sacred should be employed as a chew toy. Please keep an eye out for more offerings.</Description>
