  <Title>A Precision Approach</Title>
  <Description>Gnolls are awful creatures. Smelly. Always scratching, laughing at you. And there are multitudes here and more are constantly arriving. We, and by that I mean you, could reap them like wheat for days and never get anywhere. They can't be suffered to stay here.

We must strike at the heart of the snake! Remove their leadership and they'll be paralyzed with indecision and despair. 

What do you mean why are we doing this? Isn't it obvious? They're gnolls! What more reason could one need?</Description>
