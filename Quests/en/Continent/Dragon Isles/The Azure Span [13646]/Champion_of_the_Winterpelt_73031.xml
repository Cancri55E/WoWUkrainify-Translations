  <Title>Champion of the Winterpelt</Title>
  <Description>Thank you for all that you have done, $n.

It is all too easy to turn within and simply continue on as you always have.

The Winterpelt will rejoin the world. We will return to the path our ancestors strayed from.

And we will never forget your part in this.

I have gathered the tribe and our new allies together to celebrate. Speak with me when you are ready to begin.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Kranac to begin the celebration.</LogDescription>
