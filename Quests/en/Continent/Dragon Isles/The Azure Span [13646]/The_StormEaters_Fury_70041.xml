  <Title>The Storm-Eater's Fury</Title>
  <Description>Raszageth is attempting to rip all the arcane magic out of the tower so she can destroy it!

Kalecgos is doing what he can to hold her back, and I am using my magic to try to replenish the ley energy.

I fear we will not last much longer. As we speak, more Primalists make their way up here to overwhelm us!

Take my modified Arcane Disc. Hold off the incoming Primalists... and let us hope for a miracle.</Description>

  <RewardText>Raszageth has fled, Vakthros is stabilized... and more blue dragons have arrived.

I think we can rest for a moment now.</RewardText>
