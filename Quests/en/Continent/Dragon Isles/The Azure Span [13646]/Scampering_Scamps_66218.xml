  <Description>Hello again.

Could you do me and Norukk a favor? Our kids, Neelo and Nau, left to play. They know they should be back by now. 

I am occupied, so please find them. I doubt they are in danger, my kids know how to take care of themselves.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Neelo and Nau.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ta says all gnolls are dangerous and mean. But this is just a baby! 

Ma says I always have to take care of Nau, and she's a baby, too.</RewardText>
