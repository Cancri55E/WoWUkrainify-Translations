  <Title>Lava Burst</Title>
  <Description>The Primalists have torn apart the mountain to send their forces streaming to Vakthros!

I spied some lava orbs in the initial corridor that they're using to spread more of their elemental chaos.

Destroy them to help slow their advance. I'll do what I can from up here to help Kalecgos.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy $1oa Lava Orbs.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Meet Khadgar's projection further within the Vakthros Range.</QuestCompletionLog>
