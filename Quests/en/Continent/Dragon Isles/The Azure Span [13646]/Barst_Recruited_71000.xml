  <Title>Barst Recruited</Title>
  <Description>Well a deal's a deal. If Grimtusk needs a hand killing Frostbite once and for all, then I'm in.

What hate I have left in me I reserve for Frostbite. Did Grimtusk tell you what happened? 

All of us who hunted with Grimtusk thought we were unstoppable. Until we met Frostbite. 

Frostbite didn't just defeat us. He humiliated us in front of everyone in the hideaway. 

We were all defeated and left bloodied and battered at the hideaway. Frostbite used us as an example.

Now it's time for payback.</Description>
