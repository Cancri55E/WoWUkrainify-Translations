  <Title>Supporting the Cobalt Assembly</Title>
  <Description>$n, excellent timing.

Have you heard of the Cobalt Assembly? It was once a wondrous place where most of my kin lived.

The Sundered Flame forced us out and have taken it over. 

There was a hope that we could take it from them, but the latest information from there shows we are fighting a losing battle.

Can you lend us your support? Meet Venthi within the Cobalt Assembly if you can.</Description>
