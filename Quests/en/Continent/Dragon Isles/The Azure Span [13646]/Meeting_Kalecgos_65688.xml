  <Description>I fear we will have to split our attention. The Primalist threat to the east must be handled.

I must ask you travel to the Azure Archives in my stead to aid Kalecgos in reclaiming the Azure Oathstone.

You'll need to pick up a few supplies to help you with whatever is happening there.

Speak with our portal quartermaster, they ought to have something that can aid you along the way. 

Good luck, $n. Kalecgos will appreciate the aid.</Description>
