  <Title>WANTED: Gorger</Title>
  <Description>If you are going to be amongst the tuskarr, you would do well to lend a hand! 

As of late, a beast we call Gorger has been making its home nearby. 

More of its kind seem to be migrating to this area. This is something we can take advantage of.

Kill the Gorger and bring me its horns. We'll need them for building supplies to expand this outpost.</Description>
