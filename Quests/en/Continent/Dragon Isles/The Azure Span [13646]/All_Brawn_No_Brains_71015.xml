  <Description>Varsek is one of the toughest drakonids you'll ever meet. One of the dumbest ones too, but he'll never admit that.

He got spooked after Frostbite and started re-evaluating his life or... something. Said he never got to study the ruins left behind by his ancestors. Ran off to be a "scholar".

Get Varsek back here. He doesn't belong there anyhow!</Description>
