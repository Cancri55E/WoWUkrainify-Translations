  <Title>Reclaiming the Oathstone</Title>
  <Description>Fine work, friend. It seems we've managed to repair the leylines within the Azure Archives.

Back when the blue dragonflight was united, I would tell my brothers and sisters to never doubt the strength of mortals.

Meet me at the oathstone to the south of here. I will reclaim it, and then be on my way to Thaldraszus.</Description>
