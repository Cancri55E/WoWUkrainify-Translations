  <Title>What the Guardian Beholds</Title>
  <Description>I appreciate your aid, $c. I was the Kirin Tor mage who first discovered this artifact, Valthrux, and the Sundered Flame's plans.

The retrieval and study of this supposedly sentient and powerful artifact is of the utmost importance, and mark my word, I shall be the one to do it.

The Sundered Flame guess at its location, but I've used my magic to find a path for us.

There is a corrupted guardian nearby that holds a magic shard connected to Valthrux. I can use it to find the rest of the artifact.</Description>

Did you hear the whispers too?</RewardText>
