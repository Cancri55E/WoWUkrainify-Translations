  <Description>I haven't heard an outsider speak |L303-our tongue|l. Your |L303-grasp is a bit basic...|l

But only a friend of the clan would speak it at all!

|L303-I am Elder Mhaz. If it is safe to return home, we should set off soon. But many of us are weak with sadness of the heart--and grumbling of the stomach. I would not put you at risk gathering fresh meat, but could you gather roots for us? 

We have already gathered ones that are close. I hope this comfort food will lift our spirits enough to return!|l</Description>
