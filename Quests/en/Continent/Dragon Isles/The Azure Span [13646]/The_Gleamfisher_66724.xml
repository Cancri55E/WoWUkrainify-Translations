  <Title>The Gleamfisher</Title>
  <Description>I am sorry you have been dragged into this, traveler. 

My brother tends to get... carried away. This is only the latest of his follies. But this one might get him killed. 

He won't listen to me. He probably won't listen to you, either. 

Our ancestor, Kauriq the Gleamfisher, though, is the center of his fixation. She may be able to.

Please catch some Gleamfish and bring them here. I shall use them to help us commune with her spirit, which lingers in this stone.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve $1oa Gleamfish and place them in the offering basket.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Did you hear all that, hero?</RewardText>
