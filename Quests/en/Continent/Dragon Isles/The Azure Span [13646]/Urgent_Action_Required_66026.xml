  <Title>Urgent Action Required</Title>
  <Description>The source of these attacks must be the Brackenhide.

We've fought with the Brackenhide gnolls for generations, but until now they've been nothing more than a nuisance.

We have no choice but to take urgent action against the gnolls. Their foul decay will destroy the Azure Span, including whatever you're searching for.

Meet us outside Brackenhide. We will need all the help we can get.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Meet Brena at Brackenhide.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Just standing here, I can feel the dread of this forest wash over me. Something is deeply wrong here. 

I'm beginning to regret sending our best fighter back to Iskaara.</RewardText>
