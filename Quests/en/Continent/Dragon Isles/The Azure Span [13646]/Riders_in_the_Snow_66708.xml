  <Title>Riders in the Snow</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, $c. This magical dome is truly astonishing, is it not? But even though it protects us from the biting cold and the wilderness, we cannot count on the Kirin Tor forever.

A few days ago, some of our most seasoned hunters ventured into the forests looking for food and supplies, but they never came back. Even though I know their leader, Old Grimtusk, is a seasoned hiker and hunter, it is very hard not to worry about him and his hunting party.

Can you find them for me?</Description>
