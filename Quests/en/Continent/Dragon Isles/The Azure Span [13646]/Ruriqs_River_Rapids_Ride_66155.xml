  <Title>Ruriq's River Rapids Ride</Title>
  <Description>I did not expect my brother's approval... but it is welcome, all the same. 

The time has come! Let's see if our hard work has paid off!

Join me in The Fallstrider, $n, and we shall take off down the river, catching fish for Iskaara as we go!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Ride the Fallstrider down the river.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Phew, what a ride! It's a miracle the boat is in one piece!

Thank you very much, $n. Let us meet again for another ride!</RewardText>
