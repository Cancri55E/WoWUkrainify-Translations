  <Title>Whispered Fragments</Title>
  <Description>I believe Valthrux is trying to communicate to us through the shard we recovered.

We can use this to our advantage as long as we keep our minds guarded from the artifact's influence.

I was wrong about the Sundered Flame. They have unfortunately collected several shard fragments already. 

Valthrux's whispers claim they're close to finding its location.

Go and recover the shards from the Sundered Flame before they reach the artifact!</Description>
