  <Title>Ill Gnolls with Ill Intent</Title>
  <Description>I'm catching a strange scent on the wind. Something here isn't right...

Hanu described the gnolls in this cave as strange... and sickly. We should learn more about what is causing this.

Don't let your guard down. Despite their sickly appearance, expect them to be just as devious and dangerous.</Description>
