  <Description>Hiya! 

Are you also here to help? You look very helpful!

&lt;Heleth points to the injured dracthyr.&gt;

That guy hurt his wing trying to fly all the way up here! He looks like one of those bad guys from downstairs, but I'm not scared of him! I'm gonna help him out anyway, because that's our way!

&lt;Heleth puffs out their chest.&gt; 

I'll stand guard over him, while you go find some bandages!</Description>
