  <Title>Elementary, My Dear Drakonid</Title>
  <Description>Grimtusk wants to take another crack at Frostbite, eh? I hate to turn him down, but I left that life behind for the life of a scholar.

I'm trying to uncover the history--and make history. But I'm stumped by this esoteric riddle here in these ancient ruins. 

The riddle is this: if you touch a nearby crystal, it says "follow the pattern." But I haven't the faintest idea what that means!

Tell you what. If you can help me crack this riddle, I'll go help Grimtusk finish Frostbite off once and for all.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Help Varsek solve the mystery of the Ancient Outlook.</LogDescription>
