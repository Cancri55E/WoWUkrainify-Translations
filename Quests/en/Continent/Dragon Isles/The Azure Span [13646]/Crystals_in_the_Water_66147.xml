  <Title>Crystals in the Water</Title>
  <Description>We might not look it this moment, but we are professionals. The Expedition entrusted us with finding a clutch of rare crystals in the area--a geological survey if you will.

I'm still collecting myself after the gorloc attack. Would you be a dear and go look for these crystals? Bring samples back if you can.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Crystal Samples in Gorloc Shore.</LogDescription>
