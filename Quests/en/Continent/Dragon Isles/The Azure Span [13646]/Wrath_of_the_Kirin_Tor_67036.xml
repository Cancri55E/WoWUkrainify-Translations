  <Description>I've assembled the pieces of the device you recovered. 

Place it near Khadgar and use it to repel the Primalists! 

We just need to hold out a little longer until Kalecgos arrives.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the Arcane Blaster to help Khadgar defeat the primalists.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I am relieved that the attack was repelled... but it seems we will need to figure out a plan to help Kalecgos in the Azure Archives.</RewardText>
