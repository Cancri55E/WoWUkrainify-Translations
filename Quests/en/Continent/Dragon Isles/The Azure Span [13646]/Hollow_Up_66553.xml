  <Title>Hollow Up</Title>
  <Description>The Winterpelt are a special case among the furbolgs. 

I'd categorize 'em as a wee bit "isolationist." They are ghosts in the hollow, their pelts blendin' in with tha snow. 

Usedta keep to themselves, but now they're outright aggressive. They attacked our camp with nae provocation!

Somethin' must be wrong to drive 'em to it. I can't ask 'em what happened--yet--but maybe ye can find some clues in their village?</Description>
