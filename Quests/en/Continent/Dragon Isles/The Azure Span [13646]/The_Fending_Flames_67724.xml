  <Title>The Fending Flames</Title>
  <Description>Kattigat and I came here to prove ourselves by stopping the Sundered Flame and recovering the Valthrux.

Now we're stuck watching over this elf after she takes a few ice spider bites. We haven't even fought the Sundered Flame yet, and the spiders may do us in before we can!

We need to keep them at bay. 

Thankfully, there's a natural way to repel them. Burning silk from their cocoons creates an aroma that repulses the spiders.

Grab some silk and I'll throw it on the fire. It'll keep them away!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Shiverweb Silk.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Great! This spider silk will burn for a long time.</RewardText>
