  <Description>The Primalists are using these massive orbs here to hold off Kalecgos. 

At this rate, Kalecgos will be too injured to continue the fight. If he falls, I won't be able to fend off Raszageth.

The empowered gem you hold should allow you to disguise yourself as an elemental to sneak ahead.

Use the gem to destroy the orbs. That should give Kalecgos room to unleash his power.

I will focus my attention on shielding the tower from Raszageth.</Description>
