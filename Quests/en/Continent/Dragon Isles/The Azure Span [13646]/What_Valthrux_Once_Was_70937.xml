  <Title>What Valthrux Once Was</Title>
  <Description>&lt;To'tik whispers to you.&gt; 

I don't like this. Mysterious artifacts whispering promises of greatness does not sound good.

But we can't just walk away... otherwise the Sundered Flame will get their hands on it. Whatever "it" is...

I'm familiar with ruins like this. The blue dragons often left behind notes on their work. Keep your eyes open, and you may find some around.

We can use whatever evidence you find to warn Alia and Kattigat.</Description>
