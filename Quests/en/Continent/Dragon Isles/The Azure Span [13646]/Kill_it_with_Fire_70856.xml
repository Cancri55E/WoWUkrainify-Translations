  <Title>Kill it with Fire</Title>
  <Description>These vile spiders lay their eggs in corpses.

And sometimes the living.

We've seen several bodies of Sundered Flame who have fallen victim to them.

We can't let those eggs hatch if we want to survive here and defeat the Sundered Flame.

Take this torch. It is imbued with the power of air and fire. Point it in the direction of what you want scorched, and it will do the rest.

The Tuskarr don't mess around with spiders. I came prepared.</Description>
