  <Title>Primal Offensive</Title>
  <Description>Khadgar and I are doing our best to hold off the Primalists in the sky, but we can't push further towards the tower.

Make your way through the Primalists ahead. If I can maintain my concentration, there'll be another mirror image waiting.</Description>
