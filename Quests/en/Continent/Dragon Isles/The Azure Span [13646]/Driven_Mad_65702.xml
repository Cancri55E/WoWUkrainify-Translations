  <Description>The Azure Archives was once a place where the blue dragons would gather to discuss magic.

Now I am the only one of my kind here.

This place controls the ley lines beneath the Azure Span, but it and its servants have gone out of control.

I believe if we bring order to this place that I can then reclaim the Azure Oathstone.

The various constructs and elements are brimming with unstable arcane energy that needs to be redirected.

Destroy them and collect what you can.</Description>
