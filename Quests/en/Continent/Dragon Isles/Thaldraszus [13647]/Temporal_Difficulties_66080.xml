  <Description>Hello, $c. You're right on time!

Some trouble up at the temple is causing the timeways to destabilize and spill out into the valley. Not only that, but a bunch of Timewalkers are missing!

We've asked for extra help, but one of the new recruits hasn't arrived yet.

Can you look for her? Be careful though, time's in a massive state of flux around the valley. There's no knowing what dangers are around!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find the missing recruit in the Flowing Forest in Thaldraszus.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I knew somebody would come around... eventually!</RewardText>
