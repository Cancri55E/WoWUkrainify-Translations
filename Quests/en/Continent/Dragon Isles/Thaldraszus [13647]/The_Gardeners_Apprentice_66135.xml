  <Title>The Gardener's Apprentice</Title>
  <Description>Basilton! Lord Basilton, where are you?

My executive assistant and apprentice, Lord Basilton, has gone missing! He loves to explore, but he's even worse at defending himself than I am. I'm a gardener, not a warrior!

Could you please go find that layabout? I need him here so I can think. He's usually in the shed, digging through piles of junk.

Be careful though. He can be a bit prickly at first.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Search for Lord Basilton in the Garden Shed by cleaning up Piles of Junk.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ah, there he is! My lovely assistant. Who's a good boy? A good, spiky boy? Basilton! Who's the spikiest? That's right! You are!

Ahem. Thank you, $p.</RewardText>
