  <Title>Azeroth Pest Control</Title>
  <Description>You there! Hatchling!

Lend me a hand, won't you? These podlings are ripping up all my plants!

All kinds of elementals have invaded the gardens, and they seem to be... affecting the wildlife. It's like their energy has driven these podlings mad! More mad than usual!

I've got my hands full with just these three. Please! Before they rip up all my flower beds.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa Agitated Seedlings in the Gardens.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank the Titans you showed up! Otherwise I don't know if I'd ever get these pests to leave.

So what do you say to helping an old Drakonid out with the rest of the gardens?</RewardText>
