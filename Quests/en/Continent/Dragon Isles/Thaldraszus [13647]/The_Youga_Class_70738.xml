  <Title>The You-ga Class</Title>
  <Description>Everything was going so well, but now? Elementals are causing some, um, mild challenges.

Our guests were enjoying the facilities when suddenly, all these elementals appeared! Those nasty fiends have disrupted everything. Probably even the new you-ga instructor. 

Oh yes, you-ga is a new type of stretching that helps you meditate at the same time. I am sure both teacher and students are so relaxed they do not even notice the elementals.

Still, better to be safe than sorry. Please, look for them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find the instructor and $1oa you-ga students.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Hopefully this experience won't tarnish their reviews!</RewardText>
