  <Title>Screechflight Potluck</Title>
  <Description>Are you ready to put those acting chops of yours to good use, $n?

What? You don't have any chops? Then it's a good thing I've made you an im-PECK-able Screechflight disguise out of all the materials you just gathered!

Segallia and I still need time to finish building the final "egg" that will take out the matriarch, but I've made a smaller, prototype version for you to try out on the chef.

And don't worry! You'll be 12% safer from these explosions under all the feathers!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Wear your disguise and use the Prototype "Egg" on the Matriarch's Personal Chef.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You did great and looked pretty good in that outfit to boot!

Finally ready to cut this terrifying threat off at its beak?</RewardText>
