  <Title>A Sketchy Request</Title>
  <Description>The tarasek took everything they could get their claws on, including my scouting ledger.

These overgrown lizards hoard trinkets and trophies by the dozens. I am sure that they stashed my ledger away somewhere. Could you keep an eye out for it as you work your way through the pass?

Oh, and $n? If you do manage to find it, please do not look inside. The contents are sort of... personal.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve Alvi's "Ledger" and return it to Waywatcher Alvi.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Ah... You really did find it.

In truth, it's more of a sketchbook than a ledger. For as long as I can remember, I've been more interested in doodling than scouting...

&lt;Alvi looses a long, low sigh.&gt;

Maybe if I had actually done my job properly, then Nori wouldn't have gotten hurt.

I have to fix this... but I don't know if I can do it alone.</RewardText>
