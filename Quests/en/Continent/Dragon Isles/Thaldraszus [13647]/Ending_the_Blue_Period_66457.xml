  <Title>Ending the Blue Period</Title>
  <Description>The Embertooth all follow an oversized brute that I've taken to calling Bluescale. He has always been the aggressive sort, but until now he's always kept his pack of scavengers away from the main roads. Sure, they were territorial, but hostile? Not until now.

Bluescale has to be responsible for this sudden escalation. Find him and take him down.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>Leader of the Embertooth. Not much for negotiations.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Slay Bluescale.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>With Bluescale taken care of, I doubt we will have to deal with any organized tarasek encroachment any time soon.
