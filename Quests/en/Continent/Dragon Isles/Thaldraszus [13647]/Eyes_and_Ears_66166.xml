  <Title>Eyes and Ears</Title>
  <Description>The Primalists have been spewing their propaganda among the citizens of Valdrakken. 

Our enemies are too wily to say anything in the presence of my Scalesworn, but perhaps you might be able to get close enough to eavesdrop on their conversations and see if there is anything of value to learn.

I have marked locations on your map for further investigation. 

Take this enchanted stone, as long as you have it on hand we will be able to communicate.

Are you ready?</Description>
