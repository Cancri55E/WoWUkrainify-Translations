  <Description>The potions are ready--now to deliver them.

Take one crate to a small cave in the ravine below us. No one will be there to accept it, but you can trust it will be used well.

Take another crate to the infirmary in Gelikyr Post. An old friend tends to the patients there.

I... realize this is not your duty. Nor is it really mine. But you've been surprisingly helpful, and this medicine could save lives.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Deliver the Medical Supplies.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Szareth wants to heal everyone, no matter the consequences. Rebels, Scalesworn, wildlife: each deserves equal care.

And while I might find Szareth's idealism galling, Gelikyr depends on their expertise.

So my thanks to Szareth--and you as well. These potions will be invaluable.</RewardText>
