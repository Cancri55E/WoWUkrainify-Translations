  <Title>Gotta Collect Them All</Title>
  <Description>$PC, do you mind helping me get my cards back? 

I told Setogosa I need them to show other students how to play Hearthstone. I want to form a club, but she's not giving them back!

She's always been rude to me, but this is taking it further than normal.</Description>
