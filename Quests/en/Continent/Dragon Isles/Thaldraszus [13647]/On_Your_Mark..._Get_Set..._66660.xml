  <Description>&lt;Nozdormu's gaze is unfocused.&gt;

The further they fall, the faster they travel. They punch holes through the fabric of time which send out great ripples. You will need to be swift to catch them.

&lt;Nozdormu's focus sharpens and shifts to you.&gt;

I will send my timewalkers to help you navigate the timeways and speed your efforts. Avoid entangling with the temporal locals and do not stop until you have found Chronormu!

Go. We have precious little time.</Description>
