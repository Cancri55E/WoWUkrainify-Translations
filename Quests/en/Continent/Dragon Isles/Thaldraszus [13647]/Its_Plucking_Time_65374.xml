  <Title>It's Plucking Time</Title>
  <Description>Harleen told me she's making a disguise for you! How exciting! But she'll need some feathers from the roc hatchlings to complete the outfit.

Luckily, I've just finished fixing up the Feather-Plucker 3300!

The Screechflight are capturing roc hatchlings on the lower cliffs to raise and breed for themselves. Use the Plucker to yank the hatchlings out of danger. It'll automatically pluck some of their feathers for you as well!

Two birds with one Plucker? I should say so!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Pluck $1oa Hatchling Feathers.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This is more than enough feathers! And all collected without the Feather-Plucker exploding... right?</RewardText>
