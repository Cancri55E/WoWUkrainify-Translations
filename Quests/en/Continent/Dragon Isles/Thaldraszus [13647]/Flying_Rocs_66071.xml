  <Title>Flying Rocs</Title>
  <Description>The name is Professor Harleen Chirpsnide, infamous ornithologist extraordinaire! I came here to study the mythical bluefeather rocs of the Dragon Isles, but I suppose we've got bigger fowl to fry.

I bet these harpies flew in from Kalimdor when the Isles opened up. They're highly invasive and feasting like a pack of ogres at the Bilgewater Casino buffet.

Let's give the native rocs here a fighting chance. Take this medical kit and use it to get the injured ones back on their feet.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Assist $1oa Injured Bluefeather Rocs.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>A full-feathered job, $n!

I would have helped you with the healing and the slaying, but I'm more of an 'ideas goblin' these days.</RewardText>
