  <Title>The Thaldraszus Tour</Title>
  <Description>Thaldraszus. It is the home of the Seat of the Aspects and much of dragonkind's history. 

It is also home to soaring heights and steep deep ravines just waiting to be flown over!

As before, my bronze colleagues have set up race courses in Thaldraszus to fly while you explore. 

Why not give them a try and complete your Dragon Isles racing tour?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Fly each of the race courses in Thaldraszus.</LogDescription>
