  <Title>A Nest of Our Own</Title>
  <Description>The scroll you found is a command that all bluefeather eggs are to be brought to the harpy chef, Fry-Aerie. Apparently, the Screechflight's matriarch won't eat anything that hasn't been properly prepared and seasoned.

So we'll bring her a special egg of our own. One that's EXPLOSIVELY delicious... and will explode when she eats it. Of course.

How will you deliver it? In disguise!

Slay the creatures on the lower cliffs, collect up this list of parts, and I'll whip you up a full-feathered outfit.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Screechflight Talons, $2oa Screechflight Staves, and $3oa Creekborne Cores.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Perfect! And a little gross. Just as I planned.

Time to craft a disguise and take this matriarch out to roost!</RewardText>
