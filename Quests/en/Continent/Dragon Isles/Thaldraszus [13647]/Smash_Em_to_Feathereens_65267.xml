  <Title>Smash 'Em to Feathereens</Title>
  <Description>I was curious about these strange, winged creatures and attempted to introduce myself. I would have been eaten if not for Professor Chirpsnide and her large mechanical fowl!

Could you help us deal with these "Screechflight"? The native bluefeather rocs are having a difficult time defending their nests from them.

Also, I'd hate for any more introductions to go the way mine did with them...</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa Screechflight Witherers and $2oa Screechflight Hexclaws.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $n!

I've been assisting the good Professor while you've been gone. I'm afraid to say I've made things worse for her...</RewardText>
