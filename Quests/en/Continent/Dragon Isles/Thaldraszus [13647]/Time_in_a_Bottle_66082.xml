  <Title>Time in a Bottle</Title>
  <Description>Great! The Timewalker staff intact! But, it is definitely drained.

I know! You can recharge it using the temporal energy coalescing around the wildlife here. Unfortunately, that means defeating affected creatures in the forest. The energies were making them dangerous and unstable, and we would have had to cull the population after anyhow... 

Sometimes you have to sacrifice for the greater good. Could you help? I still need a minute.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect time energy from slain time-charged wildlife within the Flowing Forest of Thaldraszus.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This staff has been through a lot, but it should be fully functional again.

Thank you, $c.</RewardText>
