  <Title>Lashing Out</Title>
  <Description>I'm sure the podlings aren't the only wildlife acting like hooligans.

Alexstrasza's tree has always been a thorn in my side. Her life magic draws all sorts of plants and animals to it, good and bad. And guess who has to take care of the bad ones? Old Gryrmpech, that's who!

Aspects above, I'm getting too old for this.

The stewards aren't trained in combat, so its up to you to take care of the Life-Binder's weed problem.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa Invasive Deathblossoms and Lasher Weedlings in the Gardens.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The elemental problem is more dire than I thought, if you killed that many. Alexstrasza will be happy, at least.</RewardText>
