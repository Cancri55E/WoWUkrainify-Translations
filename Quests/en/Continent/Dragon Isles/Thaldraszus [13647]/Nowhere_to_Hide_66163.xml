  <Title>Nowhere to Hide</Title>
  <Description>Welcome to Valdrakken, $r. 
The climate in the city has been a bit warm of late, and I do not mean the weather.

The Primalists are skulking about, fomenting dissent among the citizens of our city.

Our foes are crafty. They have been disguising themselves as citizens of our city to hide from the Scalesworn. They know how to avoid my guards but will not suspect an outsider.

Take this Dragon's Eye gem, it should help you see through their disguises.

Go reveal and kill these infiltrators!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $2oa Primalist Infiltrators within Valdrakken.</LogDescription>
