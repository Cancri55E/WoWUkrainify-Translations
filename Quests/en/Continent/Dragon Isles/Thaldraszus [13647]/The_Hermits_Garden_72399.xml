  <Title>The Hermit's Garden</Title>
  <Description>Our parents always say we shouldn't visit the gardens above Gelikyr. They think the gardener is mean and dangerous. 

That's not true, though! They're a bit grumpy, but they're really nice! 

None of us have been up there since the Primalists showed up. It's way too dangerous now. Still, I hope the gardener is okay. Could you go and check on them, since we can't visit anymore?</Description>
