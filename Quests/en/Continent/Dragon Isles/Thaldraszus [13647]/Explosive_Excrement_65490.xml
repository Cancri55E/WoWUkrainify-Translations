  <Title>Explosive Excrement</Title>
  <Description>The harpies are a nice surprise and all, but I came to these mountains for one reason and one reason only: EXCREMENT!

Specifically, the excrement of bluefeather rocs that's then been eaten and digested by bugs. Scarab stomach juices enhance the explosive nitrogen content by tenfold! At least!

Here, take this Chirpsnide Auto-Excre-Collector. Stomp on the scarabs crawling around the cave floor, and use the Collector to reap the rewards.

Bring it back full and we can start the real fun: EXPLOSIONS!!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Fill Professor Chirpsnide's Auto-Excre-Collector.</LogDescription>
