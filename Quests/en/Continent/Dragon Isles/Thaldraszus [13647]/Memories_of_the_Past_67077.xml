  <Title>Memories of the Past</Title>
  <Description>This place is where we last saw our friend, Tyr.

We did not understand the circumstances by which he had to leave, only that it was for something important.

Though it may be difficult for our hearts to bear, I believe this spark called us here to witness that time once more. With Nozdormu's aid we may relive that moment and see if there was some other clue Tyr left behind for us.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Nozdormu to witness the memory of the past.</LogDescription>
