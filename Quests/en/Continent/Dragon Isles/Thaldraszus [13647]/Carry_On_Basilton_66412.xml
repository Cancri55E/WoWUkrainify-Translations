  <Title>Carry On, Basilton</Title>
  <Description>There is one more thing this old drakonid would like to ask you, before you leave.

Back when Lord Basilton and I first met, we would go on all sorts of adventures together. I think that's why he wanders off. He misses exploring.

I can't do that for him anymore. But you can! You can take him to see places I never would have dreamed of, I can tell.

However, we should ask Basilton what he thinks first.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Basilton in the Gardens.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I'm jealous of him, if I'm being honest. To be young again, and exploring the world. You'll have to visit, sometime, so you can tell me what he's been up to.</RewardText>
