  <Title>The Flow of Time</Title>
  <Description>The threads of time flow like a river, with many bends and branches. Occasionally, those flows can be changed. However, any anomaly left unresolved may doom our destiny to a false timeline.

We are quickly approaching one of those anomalies. I have sent Chronormu to the Shifting Sands to investigate and correct any issues to the one true timeline.

I foresee that your assistance will be invaluable. 

Please lend us your aid and meet with Chronormu.</Description>
