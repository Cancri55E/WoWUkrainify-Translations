  <Title>Vengeance, Served Hot</Title>
  <Description>The Primalists caught us completely unawares.

&lt;Velomir spits in disgust.&gt;

My fellow guardians were ripped apart by these monsters. I would have joined them in death if you had not shown up when you did.

Off in the distance I can still hear the sounds of battle. Perhaps others still live, maybe even Commander Eranog.

Lend me your aid. I need you to cause a distraction so I can sneak to a position closer in.

Killing a few of these so called "Magmasworn" would be perfect.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Kill $1oa Magmasworn Primalists within South Hold Gate.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Great work, $c. Those monsters deserve every bit of pain you gave them twice over!</RewardText>
