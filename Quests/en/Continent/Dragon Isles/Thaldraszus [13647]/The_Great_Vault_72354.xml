  <Title>The Great Vault</Title>
  <Description>Over the years, the Aspects and their kin acquired many remarkable artifacts and armaments. The Aspects ordered the construction of an enchanted vault where they could be stored for safe-keeping until such a time as a worthy soul came in search of that which lay within.

You will find this Great Vault within the walls of the bank. Perhaps, if you prove your mettle, it will grant you a piece of the Aspects' ancient hoard.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Obtain a piece of loot from the Great Vault.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>So you were able to open it after all? Even those ancient magics recognize your knack for heroic exploits. 

It would be wise to check the vault regularly. No doubt the treasures that lie within will prove useful in the battles to come.</RewardText>
