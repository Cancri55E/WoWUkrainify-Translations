  <Title>Resistance Isn't Futile</Title>
  <Description>The temporal ripples have caused trouble for the people here. Enemies appear where they were not, or are far stronger than they should be. These changes are small, but they are disastrous.

I ask you to help the resistance fighters here. Heal their wounds so that they may fight once more. Set their timeline back on its correct course, as if it had never interacted with our own. It is not much, but it is what we can do for them.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Heal resistance fighters in the Primalist Future.</LogDescription>
