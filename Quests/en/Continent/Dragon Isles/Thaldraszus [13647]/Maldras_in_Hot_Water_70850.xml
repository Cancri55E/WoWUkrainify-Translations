  <Title>Maldra's in Hot Water</Title>
  <Description>Excellent work. While you were off disrupting things I was scouting the camp. I did not expect to find my old friend Maldra Flametongue.

I knew she was missing, but the rumors said she had joined the rebels. From what I could see, though, she is their captive!

We cannot leave her here. Rescue her from the dragonspawn holding her captive!</Description>
