  <Title>Like Sands Through the Hourglass</Title>
  <Description>Like the rest of the gardens, Nozdormu's hourglass has had to weather the elemental unrest. Turbulent wind elementals came through and scattered the magical sand contained within.

Without this sand, Nozdormu's influence here is greatly diminished.

As a steward-in-training, I have been tasked with overseeing the hourglass at all times. If you would collect the sand in my stead, I would be eternally grateful.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Piles of Windswept Time Sand in the Gardens.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Excellent work.  Nozdormu informed me yesterday that he wishes to express his gratitude.</RewardText>
