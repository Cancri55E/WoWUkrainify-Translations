  <Title>It's Time To Duel!</Title>
  <Description>With my deck back, I can focus on recruiting new members to my club! I was thinking about asking the dracthyr...

Oh, that is another thing you can help me out with, $n! 

I am going to be a bit busy trying to get other dragons to join and I really want to get the dracthyr involved.

Do you mind talking to them for me? Be warned; many of them have never played before.</Description>
