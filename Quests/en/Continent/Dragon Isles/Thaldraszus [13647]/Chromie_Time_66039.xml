  <Title>Chromie Time</Title>
  <Description>This... This is the Black Empire. We have traveled very far into the past, indeed.

Look! I see Ambassador Chronormu and Eternus! We need to hurry and complete the ritual. 

Even my curiosity is not enough to wish to see where they might travel to next.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find Chromie and Complete the Temporal Stabilization Ritual.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That feels much better!

Oh, don't worry about Eternus. We've come to a bit of a truce for the moment.</RewardText>
