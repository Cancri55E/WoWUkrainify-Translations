  <Description>Intriguing. There are many mysteries living within this citadel that no one, save Keeper Tyr himself, understand. If we are to unlock this further we shall have to explore more of Tyrhold. 

I believe that the scale will draw out secrets stored within this place.

However. there is one complication. The guardians of Tyrhold are still... unstable. They may take your exploration as disruption and try to interfere. Take this conduit. It will help you should the guardians prove troublesome.</Description>
