  <Description>Making potions for Gelikyr means that I don't have time for my other duties.

A duck landed in my garden with a broken rib. I've tended to the wound, but her dressing needs replacing. And since you're so eager to help...

&lt;Szareth shoves a list of ingredients into your hand.&gt;

This is what you'll need. Bring the rest to me.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect ingredients to replace Little Jetstream's dressings.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>&lt;Szareth takes the extra pollen and linens, then looks toward their hut.&gt;

Ducks have to contend with harpies further up the cliffside. The wounded land here, and I aid them how I can.

I hope this one will make it.</RewardText>
