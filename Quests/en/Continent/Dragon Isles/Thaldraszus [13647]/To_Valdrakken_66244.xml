  <Title>To Valdrakken</Title>
  <Description>Thanks to you, we narrowly avoided a complete catastrophe.

However, we should convene with the other Aspects and share word of what happened here.

Please meet me at the Seat of the Aspects within Valdrakken. I'm sure the others will have insight into what Raszageth and her Primalists are attempting.

There is a crossing into Thaldraszus north and a bit east of here. The flight is scenic, but do not take too long getting there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel to Valdrakken and meet with Alexstrasza the Life-Binder.</LogDescription>
