  <Title>Curiosity's Price</Title>
  <Description>Look across the ravine, $r. Primalists attacked Gelikyr Post days ago, and the battle still rages.

Those people need salves and stitching. I can make it for them, but my ingredients are running low. Since you've chosen to intrude upon my home, consider yourself volunteered.

Go to my garden and find the largest vine you can. Snap it from the root, then bring it to me.</Description>

  <LogDescription>Take a cutting from the Stubborn Vine.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>The lasher attacked you?

&lt;Szareth frowns, sniffing at your clothes. Their snout wrinkles in disgust.&gt;

No wonder--you reek of blood. And not yours, I assume.

War truly engulfs the Isles.</RewardText>
