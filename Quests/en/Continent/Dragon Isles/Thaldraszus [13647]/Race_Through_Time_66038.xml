  <Title>Race Through Time!</Title>
  <Description>$n, we must act quickly to catch up to Ambassador Chronormu, and I mean that quite literally.

Zera and I will do what we can to speed our progress, but it is imperative we avoid entangling with this time period as much as possible. To do so will slow us down and we may not be able to catch the Ambassador before she is lost to even Nozdormu's magic.

We haven't a moment to lose!
