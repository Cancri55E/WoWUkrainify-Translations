  <Title>Reservoir Reservations</Title>
  <Description>$C! I know someone who is in dire need of your skills.

Tyrhold Reservoir has just been attacked by Primalists. I was lucky to make my escape when I did. I fear the others may not be so lucky.

It's just to the north of here. Find Zuttiki, she'll be able to fill you in on the details.

If she's still alive, that is.</Description>
