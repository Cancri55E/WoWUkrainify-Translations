  <Title>Finest Fungi at the Feast</Title>
  <Description>Fine dining is all about using the finest techniques on the finest ingredients, naturally. The food composed for fine dining is oft locked behind wealth and means, but we would never allow that at The Ruby Feast!

The bronze have uncovered a portal to a dangerous future. One where a black truffle with untold flavor exists!

You must go!</Description>
