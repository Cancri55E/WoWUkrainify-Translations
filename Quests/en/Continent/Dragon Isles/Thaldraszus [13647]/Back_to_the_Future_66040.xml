  <Title>Back to the Future</Title>
  <Description>We're not going to fall through time anymore but we're far in the past. Waaaaay far in the past. "The Titans Haven't Visited Azeroth Yet" far in the past. Getting home is going to be... tricky.

But we dragons can do it! 

We're going to need you to keep those Black Empire minions off our backs though. It shouldn't take too long! 

I think.

Probably.

Don't worry about it! Just keep those creepy monsters away and we'll handle the rest! Easy!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Defend your allies against the Black Empire until the temporal portal is created.</LogDescription>
