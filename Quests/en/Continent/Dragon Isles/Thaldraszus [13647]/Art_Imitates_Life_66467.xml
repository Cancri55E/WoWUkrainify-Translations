  <Title>Art Imitates Life</Title>
  <Description>The last time I was in this cave, I sketched a massive flower that dripped a vile, viscous sap. It's one of my best drawings, I couldn't forget it if I tried.

That sap is what's stuck to these tarasek spears, I'm sure of it. They must have started harvesting it to envenom their weapons.

The plant is beautiful; it will be a shame to kill it. Still, we can't let the tarasek keep harvesting it. $n, please cull the plant and put a stop to this whole mess.</Description>

  <PortraitGiverText>A writhing mass of deadly vines. The local tarasek have taken to dipping their weapons in its venom.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Slay the Greater Venomsprout.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Thank you, $n. The Embertooth's venom harvesting days should be behind them now that they have been deprived of their source.

I realize now that I don't have to be a Waywatcher to make a difference in the world. I am going to resign my post and commit myself to my art. Hopefully some day I will be able to depict the most beautiful vistas in the Dragon Isles, for all the world to see.

I just hope my sister understands.</RewardText>
