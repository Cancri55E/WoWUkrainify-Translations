  <Description>Shepherding the timeways is a dangerous duty.

Though you are not a Timewalker, Ambassador Chronormu believes you will be of great help. But to ensure your safety we must properly train you.

Unfortunately, all our instructors are still missing. I will do my best to help. Let us see how we both do. I know the Ambassador Chronormu is counting on the both of us.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak with Andantenormu and participate in Timewalker training.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That was quite unexpected! As you can see, there are many dangers that come with wielding time energy.

I do wish there was time to examine the effects of your little hiccup, but there are more important matters.</RewardText>
