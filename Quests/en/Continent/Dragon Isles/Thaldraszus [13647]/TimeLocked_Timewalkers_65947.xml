  <Title>Time-Locked Timewalkers</Title>
  <Description>I'm so glad you're here! I need you to stabilize the situation here on the platforms while Dante and Zera help me hold our infinite dragon friend in place.

The temple's security measures locked Eternus in a stasis bubble when she tried to take control of our Oathstone. Unfortunately, the other Timewalkers were also caught in those security measures.

Your Timewalker staff should free them, no problem. Just make sure to deal with any angry timelings that pop up!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Free $1oa Timewalkers from Time Bubbles.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>It worked? I'm not surprised... not entirely, at least!</RewardText>
