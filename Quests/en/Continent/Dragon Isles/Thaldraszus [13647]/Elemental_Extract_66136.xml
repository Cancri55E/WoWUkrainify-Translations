  <Title>Elemental Extract</Title>
  <Description>A huge fire elemental destroyed the pond a few days ago. I think it's behind all this ruckus, but it's too big to fight. We need to weaken it somehow.

But don't count Old Gryrmpech out just yet, I have a plan!

Water elementals decided to make themselves at home in the Blue flight's gazebo. If you can collect enough essence from them, we might be able to use their magic against them.

Fight fire with fire, right? Well, fight fire with water, I guess.

Anyway, you should probably get going.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Watery Essence in the Gardens.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Excellent! This is just what we need to snuff out those fire elementals once and for all.</RewardText>
