  <Title>Ruin the Runestones</Title>
  <Description>&lt;This runestone is strikingly similar to the one a rebel tried to plant in Valdrakken.

Though this stone is unfinished, you spy caches of completed runestones off in the distance.

If you destroy these caches the rebels will not be able to put them to use.&gt;</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy caches of incendiary runestones.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I could feel the tremor of those explosions all the way from here!

Valdrakken is now safer, thanks to your efforts.</RewardText>
