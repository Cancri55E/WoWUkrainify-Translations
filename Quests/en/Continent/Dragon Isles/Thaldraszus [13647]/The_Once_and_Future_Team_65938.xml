  <Description>All right! Let's pop that stasis bubble around the temple doors and release our Wardens! Are you ready for a huge tug-of-war match with time itself?

Yank at the door's bubble like you did with the crystals earlier. But be careful, all the time energy released is sure to collect and attack you. I'm not sure what will be there, but at least you'll have the freed Wardens on your side no matter what happens.

Good luck, $n!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use your Timewalker Staff to pop the temple door's stasis bubble.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>That's the second largest time elemental I've ever seen! I knew I should have packed my S.E.L.F.I.E Camera today.

Oh well! I'll just stop by this moment again on my next day off.</RewardText>
