  <Description>The Primalists threat has been diminished, $n. Forces from Valdrakken will be headed in soon, and can clean up any remnants. 

You should head back to the city and inform Captain Drine of what has happened. She will be interested to know what occurred here with Commander Eranog.

Thank you again, $n, for everything.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Return to Valdrakken and report to Captain Drine.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Eranog joined the Primalists? Flame and Scale, this is a terrible development!

However, you were able to prevent them from taking South Hold Gate.
