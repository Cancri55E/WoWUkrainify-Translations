  <Title>Southern Exposure</Title>
  <Description>Based on your discoveries I suspect the Primalists are attacking Commander Eranog's Garrison at South Hold. But, my Scalesworn cannot leave the city as that would be exactly what the Primalists are hoping for.

I need your help again, $n. 

Travel to South Hold, see what kind of forces we are facing, and if possible make contact with the garrison guardians there.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Travel to South Hold Gate.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>You have my thanks, and my apologies, stranger. In the heat of battle it is difficult to distinguish a friend from a foe, and there are plenty of foes around.</RewardText>
