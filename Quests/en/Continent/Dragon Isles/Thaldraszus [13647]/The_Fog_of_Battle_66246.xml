  <Title>The Fog of Battle</Title>
  <Description>The Primalist attack came suddenly and with no warning. My unit attempted to find our leader, Commander Eranog, but before we could get to the other side of the garrison we were cut off.

In the battle my unit leader, Sergeant Tagrik, held off three Primalists by himself as Kaora, Mikor, and myself battled at his side.

Their screams are the last thing I remember before I fell. 

Please, $r, if you see any signs of my unit let me know what happened to them.</Description>
