  <Title>Clear the Sky</Title>
  <Description>You did well to gather those spears and rope. With them, we can ensure those haughty Primalists will no longer rule the skies!

There is a platform up the stairway with several Siege Scorpions. If you use the rope to string their bows and use the spears as ammunition, you should be able to strike the Magmasworn's dragons in the air!

Once cleared, the path up the spire will be safe and we can continue our search for Commander Eranog.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Control a Siege Scorpion and then use it to clear the skies of Magmasworn Trueborn.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Meet up with Guardian Velomir upon the lookout tower at South Hold Gate.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>Well done, $n! That should take some heat off us. 

Keep your weapon in hand though, we are not done yet.</RewardText>
