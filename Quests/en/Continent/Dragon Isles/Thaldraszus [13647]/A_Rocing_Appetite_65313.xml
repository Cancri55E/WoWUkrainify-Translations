  <Title>A Roc-ing Appetite</Title>
  <Description>Segallia seems like a good egg, good with gadgets, but she panics easily.

For example: When I sent her into the caves directly south of here, she was promptly run out of them by an unusually large harpy. Seems it was giving orders to the others as well.

Could it be the matriarch of this brood? Perhaps a commander of some kind? Get in there and find out, $n.

And don't be afraid to ruffle a few feathers, if you know what I mean.</Description>
