  <Title>If We Could Turn Back Time</Title>
  <Description>A proper Timewalker never leaves a crisis half-resolved. Why wait and study when we have the tools we need already?

Since you have my original staff, I found a spare for me to use. I am sure no one will miss it. This is my plan: we team up on those rifts together and save the day! All the days, really. Sorry, I still get confused about the time stuff. 

What do you say? The task should be simple enough, right?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Close the Time Rifts in the Shifting Sands with Siaszerathel.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>We did it! Right?

Okay maybe there was a wrinkle or two--nothing Dante needs to know about. Also, an unexpected visitor..

Still, overall I would say that went pretty well.</RewardText>
