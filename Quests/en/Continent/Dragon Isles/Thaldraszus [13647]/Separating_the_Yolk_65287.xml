  <Title>Separating the Yolk</Title>
  <Description>I've deciphered the scroll and, surprise, it's bad news!

The Screechflight aren't just eating the bluefeathers for sustenance. Turns out they've found a spell or two that transfers the rocs' innate strength to themselves upon consumption. Especially the eggs!

Save as many of those roc eggs as you can down the cliffs from here. It'll stall the harpies long enough to put my plan into motion.

And watch out for rogue elementals. The Cursewives' spell work has stirred them up!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Collect $1oa Bluefeather Eggs.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>This is more than I imagined you'd be able to recover!

Maybe you're not a bad sort after all. Not that I was thinking that or anything!</RewardText>
