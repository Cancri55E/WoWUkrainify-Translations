  <Title>Temporal Tuning</Title>
  <Description>Chronormu and Eternus are falling though time, but I sense them stop every so often. These brief moments are our opportunity to find them.

&lt;Nozdormu conjures a small chrono crystal.&gt;

I have imbued this crystal with power as well as my own temporal resonance. They have gone to a... troubling possible future. Find them and use it. Hopefully you can fix their position in time before they slip away again.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use Chrono Crystal on Eternus and Chromie in the Primalist Future to stop them from falling through time.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Nozdormu in the present.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>The process was not finished but I can more accurately track Chronormu now.</RewardText>
