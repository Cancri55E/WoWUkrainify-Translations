  <Title>Garden Variety</Title>
  <Description>Are you enjoying the butterfly garden?

You know, there's a much larger garden just to the south of here. An older drakonid by the name of Gryrmpech tends to it.

He could always use an extra pair of hands. He has an 'assistant', but I've never actually seen him. I can't imagine he's of much help.

If you stop by, be sure to let him know that Xina sent you.</Description>
