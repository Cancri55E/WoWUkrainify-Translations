  <Title>The Never-Final Countdown</Title>
  <Description>I never thought I'd save our temple by dismantling the very security we set up to protect it, but here we are!

With the time elementals purged, our Timewalkers free, and our Wardens at the ready, it's finally time to let this last stasis bubble down and deal with Eternus.

Let me know when you're ready. I know with you by my side nothing can go wrong.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Speak to Chromie when ready.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Eternus and Chromie have fallen through space and time. We must retrieve them at all costs!</RewardText>
