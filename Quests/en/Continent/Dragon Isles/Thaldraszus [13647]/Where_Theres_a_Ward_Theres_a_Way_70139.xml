  <Title>Where There's a Ward, There's a Way</Title>
  <Description>This reservoir used to be protected by three warding stones placed by Tyr. 

They were meant to stabilize the elemental magic that is prevalent in the Dragon Isles. 

When you woke me, I sensed damage done to the west ward. I fear the Primalists may have done this to all of them. 

Still, we must assess the damage done in order to figure out what we should do next.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Assess the damage done to the ward stones in Tyrhold Reservoir.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>As I suspected. It is imperative that we find the missing keystones.

Otherwise the losses that Zuttiki and I have suffered would be for nothing.</RewardText>
