  <Title>Halls of Infusion: An Infusion of Materials</Title>
  <Description>&lt;The image of Tyr speaks again.&gt;

You have reactivated the forge. The next task will not be as simple.

Transcribed within the scale are schematics for something I require you to forge. I have entrusted one of my watchers, Irideus, with the necessary materials for this task. They are of special origin, and only few of them are left in existence.

Seek Irideus within the Halls of Infusion, where I hope his careful watch has kept the facility operating in an orderly fashion.</Description>
