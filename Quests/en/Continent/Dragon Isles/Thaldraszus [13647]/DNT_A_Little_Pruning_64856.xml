  <Title>[DNT] A Little Pruning</Title>
  <Description>Greetings, mortal. I have need of your assistance.

The gardens have fallen into disrepair during the dragonflights' long absence. Many of its plants have become... unruly.

I must tend to the seedlings, and am thus preoccupied. Please dispatch the more hostile vegetation, and you will be rewarded accordingly.</Description>
