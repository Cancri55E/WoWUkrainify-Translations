  <Title>Cracks in Time</Title>
  <Description>When the temple locked down, the Wardens got sealed up with the temple doors. We need to pop that stasis bubble to get them out! Unfortunately, that'll need a fully empowered Timewalker staff...

I know! You can drain the crystals here on the platforms! That should power up your staff enough.

They have their own stasis fields, so just yank them out and absorb their energy with your staff.

And don't feel bad if they shatter--the power is still there, even if it's in pieces!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Use the East and West crystals to further empower your Timewalker Staff.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Excellent work!

You should be cooking with more than enough time juice to release the Wardens now!</RewardText>
