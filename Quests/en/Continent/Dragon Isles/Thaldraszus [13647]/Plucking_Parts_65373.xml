  <Title>Plucking Parts</Title>
  <Description>Oh, no... I've made a huge mistake.

Harleen entrusted me with the famed Feather-Plucker 3300, a phenomenal invention of her very own!

I was planning to pluck roc feathers in the cave south of here for her research, but the harpies ambushed me and it broke into pieces as I was running out.

Please retrieve the parts! They're probably strewn about like shed scales on the cave floor.

I can put it back together. Definitely. Well, probably.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Retrieve the 4 Feather-Plucker 3300 parts.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Oh, thank the flights!

I've come to like the professor, and this could have spelled the end of our new friendship!</RewardText>
