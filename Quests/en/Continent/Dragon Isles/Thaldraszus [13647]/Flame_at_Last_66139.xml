  <Description>Alright, youngling, I've placed all the water elemental essences in this jar for you.

If you just toss it at the big one, it should work. I mean, when has water not worked against fire? It's foolproof.

The heat, uh, isn't good for my joints, so I'll just stay here. I trust you can handle it.
 
Good luck, young one!</Description>
