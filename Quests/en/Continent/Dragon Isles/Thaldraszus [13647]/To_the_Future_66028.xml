  <Title>To the Future!</Title>
  <Description>I have tracked Chronormu and Eternus to a potential future. I know not what you will find there, only that it is dark and chaotic.

Soridormi has taken some of our timewalkers ahead to that future in order to hold our connection to that time stable. Her considerable power will be needed to keep the portal open, so she must rely on your talents.

Soridormi will be able to direct you further once you meet her there.

Hurry, $n. Find Chronormu.</Description>
