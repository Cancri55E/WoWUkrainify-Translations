  <Title>Out of the Blue</Title>
  <Description>Did you see that?!

This winged creature just fell from the sky! I don't know what sort of being it is, but it certainly isn't native to the Isles.

Wait... I do remember a punchy little goblin asking for directions to the Bluefeather Cliffs just above us. You think she would know anything about it?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate Harleen Chirpsnide in the Bluefeather Cliffs.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>Some guard in Gelikyr told you I'd be here? Did they say I own 'em any money?</RewardText>
