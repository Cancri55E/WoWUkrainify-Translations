  <Title>Aspect Power</Title>
  <Description>The Mother Oathstone is an ancient gift bestowed to our flights by the Titans. If what we have learned is true, I might be able to reactivate it and in doing so restore our aspectral powers.

Though we are unsure of the outcome, if this has the slightest chance of working I must attempt it.

$n, I would appreciate if you would join me in this.</Description>
