  <Title>Lost to the Skies</Title>
  <Description>I need a favor, and you look like the favor-doing type.

An ol' pal of mine, Harleen Chirpsnide, was supposed to meet me in the city a few days ago. We was planning to eat our way through The Ruby Feast, get a trim at the barbershop, then visit that swanky auction house they got here.

But she ain't shown up. She gets lost in her work plenty, but I'd feel a lot more comfortable knowing where she was.

Try the mountains south of here. She mentioned she'd be swinging by on her way in.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Locate Harleen Chirpsnide in the Bluefeather Cliffs.</LogDescription>
