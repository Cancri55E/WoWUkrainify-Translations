  <Title>An Anomalous Shrine</Title>
  <Description>My research team located a strange sanctum nearby. We were able to make out some writing on the outside of it--titan runes, to be exact--which we believe reference Aman'Thul the Highfather, leader of the titans, in several places.

We tried to inspect more closely but must have triggered the sanctum's defenses. A massive sand amalgam blocked us off and we narrowly made it out alive.

We aren't certain what it's protecting, but it must be important. Can you investigate?</Description>
  <LogDescription>Find a way to collect the relic hidden inside the Sand-Lost Sanctum, then return it to Nozdormu at the Seat of the Aspects in Valdrakken.</LogDescription>
  <QuestCompletionLog>Return to Nozdormu in Valdrakken.</QuestCompletionLog>
  <RewardText>&lt;Nozdormu peers searchingly at the sphere as you hand it over. The sands inside brighten and swirl under his touch.&gt;

I had thought this to be lost in this timeline. Nothing ever remains so, it seems.</RewardText>
