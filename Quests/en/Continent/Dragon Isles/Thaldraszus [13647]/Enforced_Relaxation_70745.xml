  <Title>Enforced Relaxation</Title>
  <Description>Those Primalists that you saw certainly do not seem like the leadership type to me. Who would be afraid of a little dog? Hah!

So, if they mentioned Vadne, that sounds like their leader. She must be the one bringing in these elementals. We need to get rid of the summoner. They must be close by to be causing such trouble. Check the cave directly under us. I know it is where some of the less diligent employees like to take an extended break.</Description>
  <PortraitGiverName>Vadne Bleakheart</PortraitGiverName>
  <PortraitGiverText>A summoner of steam and flame, this Primalist prefers to cook her enemies alive.</PortraitGiverText>
  <LogDescription>Kill the elemental summoner.</LogDescription>
  <RewardText>I am glad this will finally start to get better! We all deserve a little bit of downtime.

I hope you find a short respite here as well: you have earned it, $n.</RewardText>
