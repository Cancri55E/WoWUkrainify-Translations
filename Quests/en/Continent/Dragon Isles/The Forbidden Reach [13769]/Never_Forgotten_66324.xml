  <Description>The antidote is ready. Use it to search the Support Creche for survivors. Work quickly--the effect will not last long, so you may have to reapply it.

If any of my people yet draw breath, save them.

While inside, perhaps you can find evidence of how this infestation came to be.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Recover items and survivors from within the Support Creche.</LogDescription>
