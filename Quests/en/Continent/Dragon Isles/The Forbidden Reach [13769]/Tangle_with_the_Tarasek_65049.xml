  <Title>Tangle with the Tarasek</Title>
  <Description>The tarasek are unpredictable and wild. Like primordial drakonid, if you will.

Neltharion considered them little more than fodder. Targets for our training. But they are cunning hunters, and deadly when encountered in packs.

Should they gain elemental power from these Primalists, they will become even more dangerous.

We cannot let that happen, $n. Thin their numbers.</Description>
