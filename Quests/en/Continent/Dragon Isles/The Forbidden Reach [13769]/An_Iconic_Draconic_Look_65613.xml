  <Title>An Iconic, Draconic Look</Title>
  <Description>I am sure your arrival in Orgrimmar drew the attention of its citizens. No doubt some were more comfortable in your presence than others.

When I was a young dragon, I took on the mortal visage you now see. It allowed me to live among the tauren of Highmountain as an ally.
