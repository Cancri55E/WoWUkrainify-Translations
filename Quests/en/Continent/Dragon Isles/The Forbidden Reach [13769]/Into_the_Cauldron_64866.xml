  <Description>Your skills are needed, evoker.

The creche is crumbling and we have few supplies. We must reach the passage out, but we have to get past this arcane barrier first.

In the chamber beyond, there are dracthyr in need of aid. Tend their wounds. Destroy any foe who stands in your way.

This may be the last time we walk these halls together, $n. Make it count.</Description>
