  <Title>An Iconic, Draconic Look</Title>
  <Description>You turned every head in Stormwind with your arrival, $p. No doubt some citizens were more... amenable to your presence than others.

In order to better commune with other races, we dragons adopt a mortal visage, like the one you see before you. Not only does it put allies at ease, but it makes passing through doorways considerably less disruptive.

Clearly the essence of dragonkind flows through the dracthyr. I suspect you may share our ability to assume a visage.
