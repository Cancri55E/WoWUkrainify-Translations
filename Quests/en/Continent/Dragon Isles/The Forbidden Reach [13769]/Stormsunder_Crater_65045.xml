  <Title>Stormsunder Crater</Title>
  <Description>Dervishian's report is troubling. An enemy force calling themselves the Primalists have invaded Stormsunder Crater, pinning the Ebon Scales down at the Siege Creche.

These intruders are summoning violent elementals and recruiting the vicious tarasek to their cause. 

Azurathel will need your help at the crater. By wing or by talon, save our people.

Once the Ebon Scales are safe, ask their commander to rendezvous with me. Be warned. Sarkareth can be... prickly.</Description>
