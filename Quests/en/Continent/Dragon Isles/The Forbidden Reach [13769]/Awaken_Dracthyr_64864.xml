  <Title>Awaken, Dracthyr</Title>
  <Description>&lt;Only flashes of memory remain as you shake off what feels like an endless sleep.

The dracthyr before you is unresponsive, frozen in place by some unknown magic. You sense that within you lies the power to break your ally free.

There may be others within the creche who are suspended in this stasis.

It is your duty to awaken them.&gt;</Description>

My memories are as broken as yours, $n. But we cannot dwell on that now.

We need to assess and make a plan.</RewardText>
