  <Title>Ground Leave</Title>
  <Description>Perhaps we should get an idea of this city, if it is to be our new home. A scouting mission, if you will.

Go, see what this place has to offer. I will follow Wrathion and attempt to help in any way I can.

Try not to upset the locals any more than you must, though. I doubt many of them are used to seeing dragons walk among them.

Meet up with us once you've gotten the lay of the land.</Description>
