  <Title>The Healing Wings</Title>
  <Description>Evoker, you have my gratitude for aiding my weyrn in our most desperate hour.

After we regain our strength, the Healing Wings will rendezvous with the rest of our forces.

Cindre tells me that Emberthal lost everyone from her weyrn. I fear I have no magic that can heal such a wound.

She may seem stoic, but Emberthal feels this loss deeply, $n. Tell her I am on my way.</Description>
