  <Title>Ground Leave</Title>
  <Description>It seems like our arrival was noticed after all. Maybe there's hope for these people yet.

I'll follow up with Ebyssian and the Horde leadership and try to smooth this out. You're on recon.

See what this place has to offer. We may be here for a while, after all.

Come find us once you're finished. Hopefully we'll have all the boring bits sorted out by then.</Description>
