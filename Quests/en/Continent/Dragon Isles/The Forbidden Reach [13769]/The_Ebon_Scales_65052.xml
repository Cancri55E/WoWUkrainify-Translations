  <Title>The Ebon Scales</Title>
  <Description>We got past the Primalist incursion. Now we must reach the creche.

Scalecommander Sarkareth is as tough as they come, and his weyrn holds the line. But a dragon has the Ebon Scales pinned down. 

Time for us to join the fight!

Take point. Give the signal when we are in range of the dragon. Then we hit it with everything we have.

Watch out for ambushes. I have a bad feeling about this.</Description>
