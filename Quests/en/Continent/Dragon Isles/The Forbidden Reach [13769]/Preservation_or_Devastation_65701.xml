  <Title>Preservation or Devastation</Title>
  <Description>If what these dragons say is true, then a great battle is upon us. We need you focused and strong, evoker.

Time to choose your battle specialization. Will you preserve your allies, or devastate your enemies? 

To hone your combat skills to their sharpest, choose Devastation.

To maximize your healing potential, take the path of Preservation.

Either specialization will serve you well. And remember, you can change or adapt it later.</Description>
