  <Title>Stretch Your Wings</Title>
  <Description>I am heartened to see that so many escaped the War Creche. My own weyrn... was not as fortunate.

&lt;Emberthal stands in silence for a moment.&gt;

There are other creches throughout the Reach, filled with dracthyr in peril. Strong wings will be needed to reach them.

Focus. Remember your training. Get a feel for the wind again. You must regain your strength and fly to the other creches.

The time for rest is over.</Description>
