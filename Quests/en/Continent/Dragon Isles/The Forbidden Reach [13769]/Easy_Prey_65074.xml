  <Title>Easy Prey</Title>
  <Description>The wilds surrounding this creche are home to scythid. They are voracious insectoids, often territorial and aggressive. 

All these wounded would be easy prey for those beasts. I do not want them attacking our Menders while they recover.

Cull their numbers while I look after Viridia.

She is.. very brave.</Description>
