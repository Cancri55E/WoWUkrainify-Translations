  <Description>The storm unleashed by Raszageth is too powerful. We must evacuate the only home we have ever known.

There is no longer an Earth-Warder to command us. For the first time, we are free to make our own choices. To find our own fate.

Wherever you go in this new age, I hope you find worthy allies. Tell them our story.

As for me, I will stay here and look for survivors. Along the way, I may find answers about our past.

May fortune favor us all, $p.</Description>
