  <Title>Ally of the Tauren</Title>
  <Description>The Elder Crone has sent me to this warzone to research the other races. More specifically, I am to collect gnome samples. Magatha is primarily interested in their survivability. Aye, the gnomes - while pitifully weak and miniscule - exude great resilience both in and out of combat.$B$BFortunately for you, I am looking for ruffians to do Magatha's bidding. Return to me with tufts of gnome hair and you shall be known to the tauren as an ally.</Description>
  <LogDescription>You have been tasked with slaying opposing gnome players in Alterac Valley.$B$BKill a gnome and return to Ravak Grimtotem at Frostwolf Keep with a Tuft of Gnome Hair.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>I don't care where the hair comes from, $R.</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Aye, this is definitely gnome. Well done, $R, but there is more work to be done.</RewardText>
