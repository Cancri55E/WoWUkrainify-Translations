  <Title>Towers and Bunkers</Title>
  <Description>Towers and bunkers are key defensive positions, and so we must hold as many as possible!  I want you to attack a tower or a bunker in Alterac Valley.$B$BTo do that, enter a tower with a Horde banner atop it.  You will see another enemy banner inside.  Pull out that banner, and a white Alliance banner will appear in its place.  Well done!$B$BAt that point your mission for me will be complete, but hold the area long enough, and if the Horde doesn't take it back, then it will be destroyed!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Destroy the banner at an enemy tower or bunker, then return to Sergeant Durgen Stormpike in the Alterac Mountains.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You haven't yet assaulted a tower, $N! What are you waiting for?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I received a field report stating you helped secure an enemy banner. Well done, $N! With their ranged troops out of position we can move the line of battle forward!</RewardText>
