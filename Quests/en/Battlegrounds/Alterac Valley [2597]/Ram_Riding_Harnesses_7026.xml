  <Title>Ram Riding Harnesses</Title>
  <Description />
  <CompletionText>The Stormpike Brigade cannot charge into battle bareback! We require harnesses for our mounts, after all, we are not savages.$B$BWhile we could easily slay the rams that roam near our base for the leather required to fashion a harness, doing so would be idiotic. We need those rams for mounts.$B$BYou must strike at our enemy's base, slaying the frostwolves they use as mounts and taking their hides. Return their hides to me so that harnesses may be made for the cavalry. Go!</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>Well done, soldier. I will notify you when I have stockpiled enough of the hides.$B$BCarry on!</RewardText>
