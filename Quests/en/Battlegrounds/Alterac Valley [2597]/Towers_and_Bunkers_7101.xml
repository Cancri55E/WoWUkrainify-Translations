  <Title>Towers and Bunkers</Title>
  <Description>Towers and bunkers are important positions, and we must capture and hold them all!  So to that end, I want you to attack a bunker that is controlled by the enemy.$B$BTo do that, enter one with an Alliance banner.  You will see another banner inside.  Pull out that banner, and a white Horde banner will appear in its place.  Well done!$B$BAt that point your task for me will be complete, but if you hold the place long enough, and if the Alliance doesn't take it back, then it will be destroyed!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Capture an enemy tower, then return to Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl in the Alterac Mountains.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You haven't yet assaulted a bunker, $N! Are you waiting for others to claim your glory?</CompletionText>
  <RewardText>I heard of your mission's success! That pleases me...$B$BOur troops can now charge forward with impunity, and show the Alliance that Alterac Valley is no place for them!</RewardText>
