  <Description>I know all about landmines. I'm the one that lays all the mines on the front lines here, after all.$B$BIf you want to defuse the Stormpike mine fields, all you have to do is kill their explosives expert. That dwarven coward is no doubt hiding in the first tower on the Field of Strife. Take him out and those landmines won't come back after they've been disarmed.$B$BIf you do happen to kill him, come back here and let me know. No good deed should go unrewarded.</Description>
