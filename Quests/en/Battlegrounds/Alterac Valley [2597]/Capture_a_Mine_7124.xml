  <Title>Capture a Mine</Title>
  <Description>As battle rages over the landscape of Alterac Valley, so too does it rage through the Coldtooth and Irondeep mines.  Both are rich sources of minerals and both are used to store supplies; it's no wonder they are so highly valued!$B$BHelp our war effort, $n!  Capture one of the mines for the Horde!  To capture a mine, enter one that we do not control and kill its leader.  When that is done, the mine will be ours and we'll send troops to protect it!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Capture a mine, then return to Corporal Teeka Bloodsnarl in the Alterac Mountains.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>You haven't yet captured a mine, $N! Find one that we do not control and defeat it's leader! </CompletionText>
  <RewardText>You captured a mine! With our own warriors protecting it, it will be much simpler to extract minerals from its depths, or gather supplies that have been cached there.$B$BWell done, $n. The deed you have done is a great boon to our battle efforts.</RewardText>
