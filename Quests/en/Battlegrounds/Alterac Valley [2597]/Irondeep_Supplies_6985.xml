  <Title>Irondeep Supplies</Title>
  <Description>The Stormpike dwarves are using the Irondeep mine as a storage depot.  I want you to raid that mine and bring me its supplies.  This will curtail the Stormpikes' efforts in Alterac Valley, and will provide us with needed equipment!$B$BBe wary, $n.  The Irondeep mine is deep in Alliance territory, and control of the mine is as shifting as the snows of Alterac.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 10 Irondeep Supplies to the Horde Quartermaster in Frostwolf Keep.</LogDescription>
  <CompletionText>Did you enter the Irondeep mine, $N? Did you raid its supplies?</CompletionText>
