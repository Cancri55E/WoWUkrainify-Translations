  <Title>Coldtooth Supplies</Title>
  <Description>The Coldtooth mine is a storage depot for the Horde.  I can't stomach the food they give their troops, and the state of their arms and armor is atrocious!  But... in times like these when supplies are so important, we can use what they have.$B$BEnter the Coldtooth mine and bring me back their supplies.  That will help keep the Alliance in fighting shape, and remove much needed equipment from the Horde's warriors.$B$BGood luck, $n.  The mine is to the distant south, deep in Horde territory.</Description>
  <LogDescription>Bring 10 Coldtooth Supplies to the Alliance Quartermaster in Dun Baldar.</LogDescription>
