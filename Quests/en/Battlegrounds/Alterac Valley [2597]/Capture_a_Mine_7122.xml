  <Title>Capture a Mine</Title>
  <Description>The mines in Alterac Valley hold more than just minerals.  Both the Frostwolf and Stormpike have cached excess supplies in the Irondeep and Coldtooth mines... that's not a bad idea, if we could only maintain control of them!$B$BCapture a mine, then return to me.  To capture a mine, enter one that we do not control and kill its leader.  When you do that, the mine will be ours, and we'll send troops to protect it!</Description>
  <LogDescription>Capture a mine that the Stormpike does not control, then return to Sergeant Durgen Stormpike in the Alterac Mountains.</LogDescription>

  <RewardText>You did it! Well done, $N!$B$BWhen we control a mine and have troops stationed there, it's much easier to gather minerals and supplies from it.</RewardText>
