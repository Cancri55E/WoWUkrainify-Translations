  <Title>Ritual of Doom</Title>
  <Description>Your research has granted you access to a very powerful ritual, one that will require the aid of a few friends if you wish to successfully summon a demon.

The ritual needs to be performed at the summoning platform above. 

Keep in mind, this sort of power always comes at a price. Not all who participate in the summoning will survive, so be prepared.</Description>
